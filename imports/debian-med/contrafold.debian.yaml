  description: CONditional TRAining for RNA Secondary Structure Prediction
  long_description: " For several decades, free energy minimization methods have been
    the dominant\n strategy for single sequence RNA secondary structure prediction.
    More\n recently, stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs) have emerged as an\n
    alternative probabilistic methodology for modeling RNA structure. Unlike\n physics-based
    methods, which rely on thousands of experimentally-measured\n thermodynamic parameters,
    SCFGs use fully-automated statistical learning\n algorithms to derive model parameters.
    Despite this advantage, however,\n probabilistic methods have not replaced free
    energy minimization methods as\n the tool of choice for secondarystructure prediction,
    as the accuracies of\n the best current SCFGs have yet to match those of the best
    physics-based\n models.\n .\n CONTRAfold is a novel secondary structure prediction
    method based on\n conditional log-linear models (CLLMs), a flexible class of probabilistic\n
    models which generalize upon SCFGs by using discriminative training and\n feature-rich
    scoring. By incorporating most of the features found in\n typical thermodynamic
    models, CONTRAfold achieves the highest single\n sequence prediction accuracies
    to date, outperforming currently available\n probabilistic and physics-based techniques.
    Our result thus closes the gap\n between probabilistic and thermodynamic models,
    demonstrating that\n statistical learning procedures provide an effective alternative
    to\n empirical measurement of thermodynamic parameters for RNA secondary\n structure
    prediction."
