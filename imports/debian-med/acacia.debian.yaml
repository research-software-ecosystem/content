  description: Error-corrector for pyrosequenced amplicon reads.
  long_description: " Acacia is a java program developed to quickly and conservatively
    correct\n errors, whilst simultaneously de-replicating, amplicon sequences.\n\
    \ .\n The main purpose of Acacia is to correct the over-call, under-call errors\n\
    \ prevalent in Roche 454 GS-FLX data, and more recently, with the Titanium\n chemistry.\n\
    \ Acacia will only ectively correct errors in amplicons - as it assumes that\n\
    \ the 5' end of the sequences start at the same position, the MID, followed by\n\
    \ the primer.\n Acacia uses empirically-derived models to identify homopolymer\n\
    \ regions where there are more `errors' than expected by chance - these imply\n\
    \ that the differences are due to population differences rather than\n error-induced
    polymorphisms.\n .\n Nat Methods. 2012 Apr 27;9(5):425-6. doi: 10.1038/nmeth.1990.\n\
    \ Fast, accurate error-correction of amplicon pyrosequences using Acacia.\n Bragg
