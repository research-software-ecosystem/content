  long_description: " VistA: the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
    Architecture.\n This is an integrated health information system that was developed
    by\n employees of the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Therefore, the\n\
    \ large majority of the source code in VistA is in the Public Domain.\n In 2011,
    the VA set up an Open Source custodial organization (OSEHRA)\n to develop an open
    source environment for VistA. OSEHRA adopted the\n Apache 2.0 License for all
    subsequent contributions to be integrated\n with the VisA code base.\n .\n VistA
    is implemented in M/MUMPS, and on Linux it depends on the GT.M\n compiler and
    database being available (this is provided by the package\n fis-gtm)."
