  description: essential files for the interactive alignment viewer and editor Strap
  long_description: " Most users should install the package strap which in addition\n
    installs required Debian packages for alignment computation and 3D\n visualization.
    Strap-base provides utilities for protein and\n alignment file format conversion:
    strap_to_clustal, strap_to_msf,\n strap_to_fasta, strap_to_multiple_fasta.  It
    also provides\n interactive alignment visualization and HTML export for other\n
    bioinformatics software.  The command strap_base with the option\n  -script=file
    or -script=named_pipe opens a new interactive alignment\n view. Named pipes are
    the basis for interprocess communication. The\n command strap_to_html is a command
    line tool to produce\n decorated and annotated alignments suitable for web-browsers
    with\n script commands as explained in\n http://www.bioinformatics.org/strap/alignment-to-html.html."
