  description: compare lengths of duplications in DNA sequences
  long_description: " Only a fraction of the DNA in the human genome (and that of
    other species\n that are not optimised for the speed of their replication like
    viruses)\n are coding for genes. Other parts may be binding to transcription factors\n\
    \ or direct the expression of genes in other ways - these other bits may\n not
    be fully understood, and parts may indeed be \"junk\", but this is\n only until
    user finds a clinical feature to be statistically associated\n with something
    statistically noteworthy in the DNA sequences.\n .\n Features that somehow seem
    informative when looking at the DNA are\n whatever does not look like random.
    This tool looks at a special case\n of repeats - short regions that are duplicated,
    i.e. they appear as a\n tandem. When these repeats are longer, then these would
    be referred as\n microsatellites.\n .\n When interested in structural variations,
    within a family/population or\n to compare cancer tissue with benign samples,
    you may also want to look\n at these repeats. This software determines the lengths
    (and changes to\n the lengths) across samples and knows how to present this graphically."
