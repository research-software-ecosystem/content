  description: compare lengths of duplications in DNA sequences
  long_description: " Only a fraction of the DNA in the human genome (and that of
    other species\n that are not optimised for the speed of their replication like
    viruses)\n are coding for genes. Other parts may be binding to transcription factors\n
    or direct the expression of genes in other ways - these other bits may\n not be
    fully understood, and parts may indeed be \"junk\", but this is\n only until user
    finds a clinical feature to be statistically associated\n with something statistically
    noteworthy in the DNA sequences.\n .\n Features that somehow seem informative
    when looking at the DNA are\n whatever does not look like random. This tool looks
    at a special case\n of repeats - short regions that are duplicated, i.e. they
    appear as a\n tandem. When these repeats are longer, then these would be referred
    as\n microsatellites.\n .\n When interested in structural variations, within a
    family/population or\n to compare cancer tissue with benign samples, you may also
    want to look\n at these repeats. This software determines the lengths (and changes
    to\n the lengths) across samples and knows how to present this graphically."
