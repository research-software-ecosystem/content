  description: set of scripts for mapping protein sequence to structure
  long_description: " pssh2 creates sequence-to-structure alignments based on\n hhblits
    profiles built for the query sequence.\n pssh2 consists of scripts to run the
    hhblits queries \n and parse the output. \n You also need the pdb_full database
    downloaded from rostlab.org:\n ftp://rostlab.org/pssh2/pdb_full/\n .\n This package
    provides the script files needed to run within\n PredictProtein.\n They are all
    called in the correct order in pp_pssh2.\n It also contains scripts to run independent
    of PredictProtein.\n It assumes you have a mysql database to store information.\n
    The configuration information is kept in pssh2.conf"
