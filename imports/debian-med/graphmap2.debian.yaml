  description: highly sensitive and accurate mapper for long, error-prone reads
  long_description: " GraphMap2 is a highly sensitive and accurate mapper for long,
    error-\n prone reads. The mapping algorithm is designed to analyse nanopore\n\
    \ sequencing reads, which progressively refines candidate alignments to\n robustly
    handle potentially high-error rates and a fast graph traversal\n to align long
    reads with speed and high precision (>95%). Evaluation on\n MinION sequencing
    data sets against short- and long-read mappers\n indicates that GraphMap increases
    mapping sensitivity by 10â€“80% and maps\n >95% of bases. GraphMap alignments enabled
    single-nucleotide variant\n calling on the human genome with increased sensitivity
    (15%) over the\n next best mapper, precise detection of structural variants from
    length\n 100 bp to 4 kbp, and species and strain-specific identification of\n\
    \ pathogens using MinION reads."
