  description: bayesian phylogenetic tree inference for large-scale analyses
  long_description: " ExaBayes is a tool for Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. It implements
    a\n Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach that allows to determine the\n\
    \ posterior probability of a tree (resp., topology) and various\n evolutionary
    model parameters, for instance, branch lengths or\n substitution rates. Similar
    approaches are implemented in beast-mcmc or\n mrbayes. ExaBayes has heavily drawn
    inspiration specifically from\n the latter one.\n .\n ExaBayes comes with the
    most commonly used evolutionary models, such as\n the generalized time reversible
    model (GTR) of character substitution,\n the discretized Gamma-model of among
    site rate heterogeneity and\n estimates trees with unconstrained branch lengths.
    For clocked tree\n models or less parameter-rich substitution models, we refer
    you to the\n established tools.\n .\n The distinguishing feature of ExaBayes is
    its capability to handle\n enormous datasets efficiently. ExaBayes provides an
    implementation of\n data parallelism using the Message Passing Interface (MPI).
    This means,\n that if you conduct your analysis on a computing cluster composed
    of\n several machines (a.k.a. nodes), the memory needed to evaluate the\n likelihood
    of trees and parameters given a large alignment can be spread\n out across multiple
    computing nodes. In conclusion, the size of the\n concatenated alignment ExaBayes
    can handle is only limited by the\n combined main memory of your entire computing
    cluster."
