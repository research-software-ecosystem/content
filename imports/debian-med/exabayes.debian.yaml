  description: bayesian phylogenetic tree inference for large-scale analyses
  long_description: " ExaBayes is a tool for Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. It implements
    a\n Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling approach that allows to determine the\n
    posterior probability of a tree (resp., topology) and various\n evolutionary model
    parameters, for instance, branch lengths or\n substitution rates. Similar approaches
    are implemented in beast-mcmc or\n mrbayes. ExaBayes has heavily drawn inspiration
    specifically from\n the latter one.\n .\n ExaBayes comes with the most commonly
    used evolutionary models, such as\n the generalized time reversible model (GTR)
    of character substitution,\n the discretized Gamma-model of among site rate heterogeneity
    and\n estimates trees with unconstrained branch lengths. For clocked tree\n models
    or less parameter-rich substitution models, we refer you to the\n established
    tools.\n .\n The distinguishing feature of ExaBayes is its capability to handle\n
    enormous datasets efficiently. ExaBayes provides an implementation of\n data parallelism
    using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). This means,\n that if you conduct your
    analysis on a computing cluster composed of\n several machines (a.k.a. nodes),
    the memory needed to evaluate the\n likelihood of trees and parameters given a
    large alignment can be spread\n out across multiple computing nodes. In conclusion,
    the size of the\n concatenated alignment ExaBayes can handle is only limited by
    the\n combined main memory of your entire computing cluster."
