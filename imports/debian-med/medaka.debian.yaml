  description: sequence correction provided by ONT Research
  long_description: " Medaka is a tool to create a consensus sequence from nanopore
    sequencing\n data. This task is performed using neural networks applied from a
    pileup\n of individual sequencing reads against a draft assembly. It outperforms\n\
    \ graph-based methods operating on basecalled data, and can be competitive\n with
    state-of-the-art signal-based methods, whilst being much faster.\n .\n Features\n\
    \ .\n  * Requires only basecalled data. (.fasta or .fastq)\n  * Improved accurary
    over graph-based methods (e.g. Racon).\n  * 50X faster than Nanopolish (and can
    run on GPUs).\n  * Methylation aggregation from Guppy .fast5 files.\n  * Benchmarks
    are provided here.\n  * Includes extras for implementing and training bespoke\n\
    \    correction networks."
