  description: search for transcription factor binding sites
  long_description: " Pscan finds Over-represented Transcription Factor Binding Site
    Motifs in\n Sequences from Co-Regulated or Co-Expressed Genes.\n .\n Pscan is
    a software tool that scans a set of sequences (e.g. promoters)\n from co-regulated
    or co-expressed genes with motifs describing the\n binding specificity of known
    transcription factors and assesses which\n motifs are significantly over- or under-represented,
    providing thus\n hints on which transcription factors could be common regulators
    of the\n genes studied, together with the location of their candidate binding\n
    sites in the sequences. Pscan does not resort to comparisons with\n orthologous
    sequences and experimental results show that it compares\n favorably to other
    tools for the same task in terms of false positive\n predictions and computation
    time. The website is free and open to all\n users and there is no login requirement.\n"
