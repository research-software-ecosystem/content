  description: biological sequence alignment conversion
  long_description: " mview is a command line utility that extracts and reformats
    the results\n of a sequence database search or a multiple alignment, optionally
    adding\n HTML markup for web page layout. It can also be used as a filter to\n\
    \ extract and convert searches or alignments to common formats.\n .\n Inputs:\n\
    \  * Sequence database search: BLAST, FASTA suites.\n  * Multiple sequence alignment:
    CLUSTAL, HSSP, MSF, FASTA, PIR, MAF\n Outputs:\n  * HTML, FASTA, CLUSTAL, MSF,
    PIR, RDB (tab-separated).\n .\n The redundancy of that source tree with existing
    JS packages needs to\n be evaluated. In the interim, the package shall remain
    in experimental."
