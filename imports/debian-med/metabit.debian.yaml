  description: analysing microbial profiles from high-throughput sequencing 
    shotgun data
  long_description: " MetaBIT is an integrative and automated metagenomic pipeline
    for\n analysing microbial profiles from high-throughput sequencing\n shotgun data.\n\
    \ .\n The metaBIT pipeline proposes tools for visualising microbial profiles\n\
    \ (barplots, heatmaps) and performing a range of statistical analyses\n (diversity
    indices, hierarchical clustering and principal coordinate\n analysis). It uses
    as input fastq files containing trimmed reads from\n shotgun high through-put
    sequencing."
