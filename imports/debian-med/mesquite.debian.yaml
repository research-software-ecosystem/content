  description: modular system for evolutionary analysis
  long_description: " Mesquite is modular, extendible software for evolutionary biology,\n\
    \ designed to help biologists organize and analyze comparative data about\n organisms.
    Its emphasis is on phylogenetic analysis, but some of its\n modules concern population
    genetics, while others do non-phylogenetic\n multivariate analysis. Because it
    is modular, the analyses available\n depend on the modules installed.\n .\n Mesquite
    also has many features for managing and processing data,\n including processing
    of chromatograms, sequence alignment, editing of\n morphometric data, and others."
