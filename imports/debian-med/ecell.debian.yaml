  description: Concept and environment for constructing virtual cells on 
    computers
  long_description: " The E-Cell Project is an international research project aiming
    at\n developing necessary theoretical supports, technologies and software\n platforms
    to allow precise whole cell simulation.\n .\n The E-Cell System is an object-oriented
    software suite for modeling,\n simulation, and analysis of large scale complex
    systems such as\n biological cells, architected by Kouichi Takahashi and written
    by a team\n of developers.\n .\n The core part of the system, E-Cell Simulation
    Environment version 3,\n allows many components driven by multiple algorithms
    with different\n timescales to coexist.\n .\n E-Cell System consists of the following
    three major parts:\n  * E-Cell Simulation Environment (or E-Cell SE)\n  * E-Cell
    Modeling Environment (or E-Cell ME)\n  * E-Cell Analysis Toolkit\n .\n This package
    contains all these parts, only the documentation is\n distributed separately."
