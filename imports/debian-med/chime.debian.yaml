  description: COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics
  long_description: " Penn Medicine - COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics\n
    .\n This tool was developed by the Predictive Healthcare team at Penn\n Medicine.
    For questions and comments please see our contact page. Code\n can be found on
    Github. Join our Slack channel if you would like to\n get involved!\n .\n The
    estimated number of currently infected individuals is 533. The 91\n confirmed
    cases in the region imply a 17% rate of detection. This is\n based on current
    inputs for Hospitalizations (4), Hospitalization rate\n (5%), Region size (4119405),
    and Hospital market share (15%).\n .\n An initial doubling time of 6 days and
    a recovery time of 14.0 days\n imply an R_0 of 2.71.\n .\n Mitigation: A 0% reduction
    in social contact after the onset of the\n outbreak reduces the doubling time
    to 6.0 days, implying an effective\n R_t of 2.712.712.71."
