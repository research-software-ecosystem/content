  description: detection of structural variants in genome sequencing data
  long_description: " To \"have a genetic variation\" may mean many different things.
    Technically\n most straight forward to investigate are changes to single positions
    in\n the long DNA chains - every chromosome is a single polymer of nucleic acids.\n\
    \ This is also what we have most data from for many diseases.\n .\n But sometimes,
    DNA that looks completely the same when looking at short reads\n at the time (and
    not feeling lucky), the position looked at may be inverted\n on the chromosome.
    Or it may be a copy of the original site and not a \"real\"\n single-nucleotide
    polymorphism (SNP). Or it may have translocated to\n another chromosome.\n .\n\
    \ These are examples for structural changes to the DNA. Individuals may never\n\
    \ notice them. Or there may be a higher chances to develop a disease or it may\n\
    \ affect fertility. Technologies like the Nanopore have emerged that can read\n\
    \ longer segments of the DNA, so one can see multiple copies of the same gene\n\
    \ in the same read or at least can assemble the DNA fragments read in a way to\n\
    \ then align the reads non-ambiguously and support the analysis of such\n copy-number
    variations (CNVs).\n .\n This snakemake pipeline on nanopore whole genome sequencing
    data provides\n a complete structural variant analysis. Steps implemented and
    tools\n wrapped comprise:\n  * fast: minimap2 alignment with Sniffles and SVIM
    SV calling\n  * precise: ngmlr alignment with Sniffles SV calling\n  * minimap2:
    minimap2 alignment with Sniffles, SVIM, NanoSV and npInv SV calling\n  * minimap2_pbsv:
    minimap2 alignment with pbsv-specific parameters with\n    pbsv, SVIM, NanoSV
    and npInv SV calling\n  * ngmlr: ngmlr with Sniffles, NanoSV, SVIM and npInv SV
    calling\n  * last-prepare: create a LAST index and train aligner parameters using
    last-train\n  * last: LAST alignment with tandem-genotypes STR calling"
