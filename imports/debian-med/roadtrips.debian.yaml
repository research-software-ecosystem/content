  description: case-control association testing with unknown population and pedigree
    structure
  long_description: " ROADTRIPS performs single-SNP, case-control association testing
    in\n samples with partially or completely unknown population and pedigree\n structure.
    ROADTRIPS uses an empirical covariance matrix calculated from\n genomewide SNP
    data to correct for unknown population and pedigree\n structure, while maintaining
    high power by taking advantage of known\n pedigree information when it is available.
    The program is applicable to\n association studies with completely general combinations
    of related and\n unrelated individuals. Analysis can be performed genomewide (currently\n\
    \ just for autosomes).\n .\n ROADTRIPS is suitable for applications such as:\n\
    \  * correcting for possible population structure and/or misspecified\n    relationships
    in the context of case-control association testing in\n    samples of unrelated
    individuals and/or related individuals with well-\n    characterized pedigrees\n\
    \  * case-control association testing in samples from isolated populations\n \
    \   for which pedigree information is limited or unavailable"
