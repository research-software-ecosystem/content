  description: protein secondary structure prediction
  long_description: " PSIPRED is a  simple and accurate secondary structure prediction\n
    method, incorporating two feed-forward neural networks which perform an\n analysis
    on output obtained from PSI-BLAST (Position Specific Iterated -\n BLAST). Using
    a very stringent cross validation method to evaluate the\n method's performance,
    PSIPRED 2.6 achieves an average Q3 score of 80.7%.  "
