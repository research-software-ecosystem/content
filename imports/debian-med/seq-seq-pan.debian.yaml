  description: workflow for the SEQuential alignment of SEQuences
  long_description: " Seq-seq-pan is a framework that provides methods for adding
    or removing\n new genomes from a set of aligned genomes and uses these to construct
    a\n whole genome alignment. Throughout the sequential workflow the alignment\n\
    \ is optimized for generating a representative linear presentation of the\n aligned
    set of genomes, that enables its usage for annotation and in\n downstream analyses."
