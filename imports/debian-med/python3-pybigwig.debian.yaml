  description: read/write chromosomal sequence data in bigWig files
  long_description: " This package provides a python extension, written in C, for
    quick\n access to bigBed files and access to and creation of bigWig files. This\n
    extension uses libBigWig for local and remote file access\n .\n The bigWig format
    was originally created in the context of genome\n browsers. There, computing exact
    summary statistics for a given interval\n is less important than quickly being
    able to compute an approximate\n statistic. Because of this, bigWig files contain
    not only interval-value\n associations, but also `sum of values`/`sum of squared
    values`/`minimum\n value`/`maximum value`/`number of bases covered` for equally
    sized\n bins of various sizes. These different sizes are referred to as \"zoom\n
    levels\". The smallest zoom level has bins that are 16 times the mean\n interval
    size in the file and each subsequent zoom level has bins 4 times\n larger than
    the previous. This methodology is used in Kent's tools and,\n therefore, likely
    used in almost every currently existing bigWig file.\n .\n When a bigWig file
    is queried for a summary statistic, the size of the\n interval is used to determine
    whether to use a zoom level and, if so,\n which one. The optimal zoom level is
    that which has the largest bins no\n more than half the width of the desired interval.
    If no such zoom level\n exists, the original intervals are instead used for the
    calculation."
