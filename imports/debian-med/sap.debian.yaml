  description: Pairwise protein structure alignment via double dynamic programming
  long_description: " In contrast to DNA, proteins exhibit an apparently unlimited
    variety of\n structure. This is a necessary requirement of the vast array of\n
    differing functions that they perform in the maintainance of life,\n again, in
    contrast to the relatively static archival function of DNA.\n Not only do we observe
    a bewildering variety of form but even within a\n common structure, there is variation
    in the lengths and orientation\n substructures. Such variation is both a reflection
    on the very long time\n periods over which some structures have diverged and also
    a consequence\n of the fact that proteins cannot be completely rigid bodies but
    must\n have flexibility to accommodate the structural changes that are almost\n
    always necessary for them to perform their functions. These aspects make\n comparing
    structure and finding structural similarity over long\n divergence times very
    difficult. Indeed, computationally, the problem of\n recognizing similarity is
    one of three-dimensional pattern recognition,\n which is a notoriously difficult
    problem for computers to perform. In\n this chapter, guidance is provided on the
    use of a flexible structure\n comparison method that overcomes many of the problems
    of comparing\n protein structures that may exhibit only weak similarity."
