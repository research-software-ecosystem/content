  description: Pairwise protein structure alignment via double dynamic programming
  long_description: " In contrast to DNA, proteins exhibit an apparently unlimited
    variety of\n structure. This is a necessary requirement of the vast array of\n\
    \ differing functions that they perform in the maintainance of life,\n again,
    in contrast to the relatively static archival function of DNA.\n Not only do we
    observe a bewildering variety of form but even within a\n common structure, there
    is variation in the lengths and orientation\n substructures. Such variation is
    both a reflection on the very long time\n periods over which some structures have
    diverged and also a consequence\n of the fact that proteins cannot be completely
    rigid bodies but must\n have flexibility to accommodate the structural changes
    that are almost\n always necessary for them to perform their functions. These
    aspects make\n comparing structure and finding structural similarity over long\n\
    \ divergence times very difficult. Indeed, computationally, the problem of\n recognizing
    similarity is one of three-dimensional pattern recognition,\n which is a notoriously
    difficult problem for computers to perform. In\n this chapter, guidance is provided
    on the use of a flexible structure\n comparison method that overcomes many of
    the problems of comparing\n protein structures that may exhibit only weak similarity."
