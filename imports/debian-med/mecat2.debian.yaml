  description: ultra-fast and accurate de novo assembly tools for SMRT reads
  long_description: " An improved version of MECAT. It is an ultra-fast and accurate
    mapping\n and error correcting de novo assembly tools for single molecula\n sequencing
    (SMRT) reads. MECAT2 consists of the following three modules:\n  1. mecat2map:
    a fast and accurate alignment tool for SMRT reads.\n  2. mecat2cns: correct noisy
    reads based on their pairwise overlaps.\n  3. fsa: a string graph based assembly
