  description: secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictor
  long_description: " This package provides prof(1), the protein secondary structure,
    accessibility\n and transmembrane helix predictor from Burkhard Rost.  Prediction
    is either\n done from protein sequence alone or from an alignment - the latter
    should be\n used for optimal performance.\n .\n How well does prof(1) perform?\n\
    \ .\n  * Secondary structure is predicted at an expected average accuracy > 72%
    for\n    the three states helix, strand and loop.\n .\n  * Solvent accessibility
    is predicted at a correlation coefficient\n    (correlation between experimentally
    observed and predicted relative\n    solvent accessibility) of 0.54\n .\n  * Transmembrane
    helix prediction has an expected per-residue accuracy of\n    about 95%.  The
    number of false positives, i.e., transmembrane helices\n    predicted in globular
    proteins, is about 2%."
