  description: network-enabled tools for epidemiology and public health practice
  long_description: " NetEpi, which is short for \"Network-enabled Epidemiology\"\
    , is a\n collaborative project to create a suite of free, open source software\n\
    \ tools for epidemiology and public health practice. Anyone with an\n interest
    in population health epidemiology or public health\n informatics is encouraged
    to examine the prototype tools and to\n consider contributing to their further
    development. Contributions\n which involve formal and/or informal testing of the
    tools in a wide\n range of circumstances and environments are particularly welcome,
    as\n is assistance with design, programming and documentation tasks.\n .\n This
    is a tool for conducting epidemiological analysis of data sets,\n both large and
    small, either through a Web browser interface, or via\n a programmatic interface.
    In many respects it is similar to the\n analysis facilities included in the Epi
    Info suite, except that\n NetEpi Analysis is designed to be installed on servers
    and accessed\n remotely via Web browsers, although it can also be installed on\n\
    \ individual desktop or laptop computers.\n .\n The software was developed by
    New South Wales Department of Health."
