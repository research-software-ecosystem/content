  description: QC and genome browser plotting Oxford Nanopore and PacBio long reads
  long_description: " Pauvre is a plotting package designed for nanopore and PacBio
    long reads.\n .\n This package currently hosts four scripts for plotting and/or
    printing stats.\n .\n  pauvre marginplot\n     Takes a fastq file as input and
    outputs a marginal histogram with a\n     heatmap.\n  pauvre stats\n     Takes
    a fastq file as input and prints out a table of stats, including\n     how many
    basepairs/reads there are for a length/mean quality cutoff.\n     This is also
    automagically called when using pauvre marginplot\n  pauvre redwood\n     Method
    of representing circular genomes. A redwood plot contains long\n     reads as
    \"rings\" on the inside, a gene annotation \"cambrium/phloem\",\n     and a RNAseq
    \"bark\". The input is .bam files for the long reads and\n     RNAseq data, and
    a .gff file for the annotation.\n  pauvre synteny\n     Makes a synteny plot of
    circular genomes. Finds the most parsimonius\n     rotation to display the synteny
    of all the input genomes with the\n     fewest crossings-over. Input is one .gff
    file per circular genome\n     and one directory of gene alignments.\n"
