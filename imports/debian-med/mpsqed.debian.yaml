  description: alignment editor and multiplex pyrosequencing assay designer
  long_description: " Molecular-based diagnostic assays are the gold standard for
    infectious\n diseases today, since they allow a rapid and sensitive identification\n\
    \ and typing of various pathogens. While PCR can be designed to be\n specific
    for a certain pathogen, a subsequent sequence analysis is\n frequently required
    for confirmation or typing. The design of\n appropriate PCR-based assays is a
    complex task, especially when\n conserved discriminating polymorphisms are rare
    or if the number of\n types which need to be differentiated is high. One extremely
    useful but\n underused method for this purpose is the multiplex pyrosequencing\n\
    \ technique. mPSQed is a program developed at the Robert Koch Institute\n and
    targeted at facilitating the creation of such assays."
