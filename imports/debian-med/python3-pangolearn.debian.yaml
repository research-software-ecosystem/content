  description: store of the trained model for pangolin to access
  long_description: " Pangolin runs a multinomial logistic regression model trained
    against\n lineage assignments based on GISAID data.\n .\n Legacy pangolin runs
    using a guide tree and alignment hosted at\n cov-lineages/lineages. Some of this
    data is sourced from GISAID, but\n anonymised and encrypted to fit with guidelines.
    Appropriate permissions\n have been given and acknowledgements for the teams that
    have worked to\n provide the original SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to GISAID are
    also\n hosted here.\n .\n This package contains the store of the trained model
    for pangolin.\n"
