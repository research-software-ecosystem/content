  description: presentation of traces of molecular dynamics runs
  long_description: " VMD stands for Visual Molecular Dynamics. While text books\n\
    \ and even structure databases because of technical problems only\n present static
    pictures of proteins or DNA, for the understanding\n of the properties of those
    molecules their vibration or their\n movement in general is important.\n .\n The
    movements itself are calculated by molecular dynamics programs,\n such as NAMD
    (by the same group), Rosetta, BALLView or GROMACS. The\n latter two are already
    in the distribution, we have package build\n instructions for Rosetta.\n .\n VMD
    has a series of nice features, from displaying through animation\n to analysing.\
    \  It can be scripted, clustered, and runs on all common OS.\n Its license does
    not allow to redistribute a Debian package. But\n to share these build instructions
    for such a package is just fine."
