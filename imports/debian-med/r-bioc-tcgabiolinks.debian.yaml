  description: GNU R/Bioconductor package for integrative analysis with GDC data
  long_description: " The aim of TCGAbiolinks is:\n  1) facilitate the GDC open-access
    data retrieval,\n  2) prepare the data using the appropriate pre-processing strategies,\n\
    \  3) provide the means to carry out different standard analyses and\n  4) to
    easily reproduce earlier research results.\n In more detail, the package provides
    multiple methods for analysis (e.g.,\n differential expression analysis, identifying
    differentially methylated\n regions) and methods for visualization (e.g., survival
    plots, volcano plots,\n starburst plots) in order to easily develop complete analysis
    pipelines.\n"
