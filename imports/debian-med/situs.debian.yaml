  description: Modeling of atomic resolution structures into low-resolution density
    maps
  long_description: " Situs is an award-winning program package for the modeling of
    atomic resolution\n structures into low-resolution density maps e.g. from electron
    microscopy,\n tomography, or small angle X-ray scattering. The software supports
    both\n rigid-body and flexible docking using a variety of fitting strategies.
    Situs is\n developed by Willy Wriggers and collaborators: biomachina.org."
