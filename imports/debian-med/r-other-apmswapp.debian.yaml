  description: GNU R Pre- and Postprocessing For Affinity Purification Mass 
    Spectrometry
  long_description: " The reliable detection of protein-protein-interactions by affinity\n\
    \ purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a crucial stepping stone for\n the
    understanding of biological processes. The main challenge in a\n typical AP-MS
    experiment is to separate true interaction proteins from\n contaminants by contrasting
    counts of proteins binding to specific baits\n with counts of negative controls."
