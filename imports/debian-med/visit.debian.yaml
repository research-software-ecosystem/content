  description: interactive parallel visualization and graphical analysis tool
  long_description: " VisIt is a free interactive parallel visualization and graphical\n\
    \ analysis tool for viewing scientific data.  Users can quickly generate\n visualizations
    from their data, animate them through time, manipulate\n them, and save the resulting
    images for presentations.  VisIt contains\n a rich set of visualization features
    so that you can view your data in\n a variety of ways.  It can be used to visualize
    scalar and vector\n fields defined on two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) structured
    and\n unstructured meshes.\n .\n VisIt was designed to handle very large data
    set sizes in the terascale\n range and yet can also handle small data sets in
    the kilobyte range."
