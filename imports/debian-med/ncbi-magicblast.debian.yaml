  description: RNA-seq mapping tool
  long_description: " Magic-BLAST is a tool for mapping large next-generation RNA
    or DNA\n sequencing runs against a whole genome or transcriptome. Each alignment\n\
    \ optimizes a composite score, taking into account simultaneously the two\n reads
    of a pair, and in case of RNA-seq, locating the candidate introns\n and adding
    up the score of all exons. This is very different from other\n versions of BLAST,
    where each exon is scored as a separate hit and read-\n pairing is ignored."
