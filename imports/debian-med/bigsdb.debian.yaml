  description: Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database
  long_description: " The Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) is a
    scalable,\n web-accessible database system designed to store and analyse linked\n\
    \ phenotypic and genotypic information in a computationally efficient\n manner.
    Sequence data can range from single sequence reads to multiple\n contigs generated
    by whole genome sequencing technologies. The system\n incorporates the capacity
    to define and identify any number of loci and\n genetic variants at those loci
    within the stored nucleotide sequences.\n These loci can be further organised
    into schemes for isolate\n characterisation or for evolutionary or functional
    analyses."
