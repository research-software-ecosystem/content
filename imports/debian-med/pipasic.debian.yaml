  description: Protein Abundance Correction in Metaproteomic Data
  long_description: " Metaproteomic analysis allows studying the interplay of organisms
    or\n functional groups and has become increasingly popular also for\n diagnostic
    purposes. However, difficulties arise due to the high\n sequence similarity between
    related organisms. Further, the state of\n conservation of proteins between species
    can be correlated with their\n expression level which can lead to significant
    bias in results and\n interpretation. These challenges are similar but not identical
    to the\n challenges arising in the analysis of metagenomic samples and require\n\
    \ specific solutions.\n .\n pipasic (peptide intensity-weighted proteome abundance
    similarity\n correction) is a tool which corrects identification and spectral\n\
    \ counting based quantification results using peptide similarity\n estimation
    and expression level weighting within a non-negative lasso\n framework. pipasic
    has distinct advantages over approaches only\n regarding unique peptides or aggregating
    results to the lowest common\n ancestor."
