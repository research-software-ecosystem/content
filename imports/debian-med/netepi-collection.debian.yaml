  description: network-enabled tools for epidemiology and public health practice
  long_description: " NetEpi, which is short for \"Network-enabled Epidemiology\"\
    , is a\n collaborative project to create a suite of free, open source software\n\
    \ tools for epidemiology and public health practice. Anyone with an\n interest
    in population health epidemiology or public health\n informatics is encouraged
    to examine the prototype tools and to\n consider contributing to their further
    development. Contributions\n which involve formal and/or informal testing of the
    tools in a wide\n range of circumstances and environments are particularly welcome,
    as\n is assistance with design, programming and documentation tasks.\n .\n NetEpi
    Case Manager is a tool for securely collecting structured\n information about
    cases and contacts of communicable (and other)\n diseases through Web browsers
    and the Internet. New data collection\n forms can be designed and deployed quickly
    by epidemiologists, using\n a \"point-and-click\" interface, without the need
    for knowledge of or\n training in any programming language. Data can then be collected
    from\n users of the system, who can be located anywhere in the world, into a\n\
    \ centralised database. All that is needed by users of the system is a\n relatively
    recent Web browser and an Internet connection (\"NetEpi\" is\n short for \"Network-enabled
    Epidemiology\"). In many respects, NetEpi\n Case Manager is like a Web-enabled
    version of the data entry\n facilities in the very popular Epi Info suite of programmes
    published\n by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in the\n\
    \ Danish EpiData project, which is available for several languages. The\n software
    was developed by the Centre for Epidemiology and Research of\n the New South Wales
    Department of Health, with contributions from\n Population Health Division of
    the Australian Government Department of\n Health and Ageing.\n .\n The software
    was developed by New South Wales Department of Health."
