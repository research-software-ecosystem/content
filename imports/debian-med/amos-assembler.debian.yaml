  description: modular whole genome assembler
  long_description: " The AMOS consortium is committed to the development of open-source\n\
    \ whole genome assembly software. The project acronym (AMOS) represents\n our
    primary goal - to produce A Modular, Open-Source whole genome\n assembler. Open-source
    so that everyone is welcome to contribute and\n help build outstanding assembly
    tools, and modular in nature so that\n new contributions can be easily inserted
    into an existing assembly\n pipeline. This modular design will foster the development
    of new\n assembly algorithms and allow the AMOS project to continually grow\n\
    \ and improve in hopes of eventually becoming a widely accepted and\n deployed
    assembly infrastructure. In this sense, AMOS is both a\n design philosophy and
    a software system."
