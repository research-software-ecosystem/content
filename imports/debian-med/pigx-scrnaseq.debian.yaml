  description: pipeline for checkpointed and distributed scRNA-seq analyses
  long_description: " This package provides a automated workflow for the automated
    analysis of\n single-cell RNA-seq experiments. A series of well-accecpted tools
    are\n connected in Python scripts and controlled via snakemake. This supports\n
    the parallel execution of these workflows and provides checkpointing,\n such that
    interrupted workflows can take up their work again."
