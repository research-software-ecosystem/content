  description: pipeline for checkpointed and distributed scRNA-seq analyses
  long_description: " This package provides a automated workflow for the automated
    analysis of\n single-cell RNA-seq experiments. A series of well-accecpted tools
    are\n connected in Python scripts and controlled via snakemake. This supports\n\
    \ the parallel execution of these workflows and provides checkpointing,\n such
    that interrupted workflows can take up their work again."
