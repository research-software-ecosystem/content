  description: model the spread of an infectious disease in a population
  long_description: " EpiFire is a C++ applications programming interface (API) that
    does\n two things:\n .\n  * Model the spread of an infectious disease in a population\n\
    \  * Generate and manipulate networks of nodes and edges\n .\n While the network
    code can be used independently from the\n epidemiological code and vice versa—they
    are conceptually and\n functionally distinct—from the beginning, the libraries
    were developed\n to be compatible with each other. What EpiFire excels at is simulating\n
    the stochastic spread of disease on contact networks."
