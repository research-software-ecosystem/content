  description: simulate the evolution of nucleotide or amino acid sequences
  long_description: " Seq-Gen is a program that will simulate the evolution of nucleotide\n\
    \ or amino acid sequences along a phylogeny, using common models of the\n substitution
    process. A range of models of molecular evolution are\n implemented including
    the general reversible model. State frequencies\n and other parameters of the
    model may be given and site-specific rate\n heterogeneity may also be incorporated
    in a number of ways. Any number\n of trees may be read in and the program will
    produce any number of data\n sets for each tree. Thus large sets of replicate
    simulations can be\n easily created. It has been designed to be a general purpose
    simulator\n that incorporates most of the commonly used\n (and computationally
    tractable) models of molecular sequence evolution.\n"
