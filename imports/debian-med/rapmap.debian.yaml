  description: rapid sensitive and accurate DNA read mapping via quasi-mapping
  long_description: " RapMap is a testing ground for ideas in quasi-mapping / (lightweight
    /\n pseudo) transcriptome alignment. That means that, at this point, it is\n somewhat
    experimental. The develop branch will have the latest\n improvements and additions,
    but is not guaranteed to be stable between\n commits. Breaking changes to the
    master branch will be accompanied by a\n tag to the version before the breaking
    change. Currently, RapMap is a\n stand-alone quasi-mapper that can be used with
    other tools. It is also\n being used as part of Sailfish and Salmon. Eventually,
    the hope is to\n create and stabilize an API so that it can be used as a library
    from\n other tools.\n .\n Quasi-mapping / (lightweight / pseudo)-alignment is
    the term that is\n used here for the type of information required for certain
    tasks (e.g.\n transcript quantification) that is less \"heavyweight\" than what
    is\n provided by traditional alignment. For example, one may only need to\n know
    the transcripts / contigs to which a read aligns and, perhaps, the\n position
    within those transcripts rather than the optimal alignment and\n base-for-base
    CIGAR string that aligns the read and substring of the\n transcript. For details
    on RapMap (quasi-mapping in particular), please\n check out the associated paper.
    Note: RapMap implements both quasi-\n mapping and pseudo-alignment (originally
    introduced in Bray et al.\n 2016), these two are not the same thing. They are
    distinct concepts, and\n RapMap simply happens to implement algorithms for computing
    both.\n"
