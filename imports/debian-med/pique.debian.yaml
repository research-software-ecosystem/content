  description: software pipeline for performing genome wide association studies
  long_description: " PIQUE is a software pipeline for performing genome wide association\n\
    \ studies (GWAS). The main function of PIQUE is to provide ‘convenience’\n wrappers
    that allow users to perform GWAS using the popular program\n EMMAX (Kang et al.,
    2010) without the need to be familiar with all of\n the software tools used to
    generate the required EMMAX input files.\n PIQUE will also perform a number of
    quality control steps prior to\n running EMMAX, ensuring that the various input
    data files are in the\n correct format. PIQUE proceeds in two main stages although
    there are\n multiple entry and exit points from which the pipeline can be run.
    The\n first stage consists of running the “pique-input” program, which can\n read
    genotype and phenotype information in several different formats and\n generates
    all the necessary input files required to run EMMAX. The\n second step in the
    pipeline uses the “pique-run” program to actually run\n EMMAX using the files
    generated by “pique-input” (or pre-existing\n user-supplied input files) to perform
    the GWAS and output the analysis\n summary files.\n"
