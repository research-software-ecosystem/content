  description: Efficient index for the colored, compacted, de Bruijn graph
  long_description: " Pufferfish is a new time and memory-efficient data structure
    for indexing a\n compacted, colored de Bruijn graph (ccdBG).\n .\n Though the
    de Bruijn Graph (dBG) has enjoyed tremendous popularity as an\n assembly and sequence
    comparison data structure, it has only relatively\n recently begun to see use
    as an index of the reference sequences (e.g. deBGA,\n kallisto). Particularly,
    these tools index the compacted dBG (cdBG), in which\n all non-branching paths
    are collapsed into individual nodes and labeled with\n the string they spell out.
    This data structure is particularly well-suited for\n representing repetitive
    reference sequences, since a single contig in the cdBG\n represents all occurrences
    of the repeated sequence. The original positions in\n the reference can be recovered
    with the help of an auxiliary \"contig table\"\n that maps each contig to the
    reference sequence, position, and orientation\n where it appears as a substring.
    The deBGA paper has a nice description how\n this kind of index looks (they call
    it a unipath index, because the contigs we\n index are unitigs in the cdBG), and
    how all the pieces fit together to be able\n to resolve the queries we care about.\
    \  Moreover, the cdBG can be built on\n multiple reference sequences (transcripts,
    chromosomes, genomes), where each\n reference is given a distinct color (or colour,
    if you're of the British\n persuasion). The resulting structure, which also encodes
    the relationships\n between the cdBGs of the underlying reference sequences, is
    called the\n compacted, colored de Bruijn graph (ccdBG).  This is not, of course,
    the only\n variant of the dBG that has proven useful from an indexing perspective.
    The\n (pruned) dBG has also proven useful as a graph upon which to build a path\n\
    \ index of arbitrary variation / sequence graphs, which has enabled very\n interesting
    and clever indexing schemes like that adopted in GCSA2. Also,\n thinking about
    sequence search in terms of the dBG has led to interesting\n representations for
    variation-aware sequence search backed by indexes like the\n vBWT (implemented
    in the excellent gramtools package)."
