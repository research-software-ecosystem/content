  description: Infers new Immunoglobulin alleles from Rep-Seq Data
  long_description: " Summary: Infers the V genotype of an individual from immunoglobulin
    (Ig)\n repertoire-sequencing (Rep-Seq) data, including detection of any novel\n
    alleles. This information is then used to correct existing V allele calls\n from
    among the sample sequences.\n .\n High-throughput sequencing of B cell immunoglobulin
    receptors is\n providing unprecedented insight into adaptive immunity. A key step
    in\n analyzing these data involves assignment of the germline V, D and J gene\n
    segment alleles that comprise each immunoglobulin sequence by matching\n them
    against a database of known V(D)J alleles. However, this process\n will fail for
    sequences that utilize previously undetected alleles,\n whose frequency in the
    population is unclear.\n .\n TIgGER is a computational method that significantly
    improves V(D)J\n allele assignments by first determining the complete set of gene
    segments\n carried by an individual (including novel alleles) from V(D)J-rearrange\n
    sequences. TIgGER can then infer a subject’s genotype from these\n sequences,
    and use this genotype to correct the initial V(D)J allele\n assignments.\n .\n
    The application of TIgGER continues to identify a surprisingly high\n frequency
    of novel alleles in humans, highlighting the critical need\n for this approach.
    TIgGER, however, can and has been used with data\n from other species.\n .\n Core
    Abilities:\n  * Detecting novel alleles\n  * Inferring a subject’s genotype\n\
    \  * Correcting preliminary allele calls\n .\n Required Input\n  * A table of
    sequences from a single individual, with columns containing\n    the following:\n\
    \    -   V(D)J-rearranged nucleotide sequence (in IMGT-gapped format)\n    - \
    \  Preliminary V allele calls\n    -   Preliminary J allele calls\n    -   Length
    of the junction region\n  * Germline Ig sequences in IMGT-gapped fasta format
    (e.g., as those\n    downloaded from IMGT/GENE-DB)\n .\n The former can be created
    through the use of IMGT/HighV-QUEST and\n Change-O.\n"
