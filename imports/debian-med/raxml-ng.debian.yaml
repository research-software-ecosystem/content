  description: phylogenetic tree inference tool which uses maximum-likelihood
  long_description: " RAxML Next Generation: faster, easier-to-use and more flexible\n\
    \ .\n RAxML-NG is a phylogenetic tree inference tool which uses maximum-likelihood\n\
    \ (ML) optimality criterion. Its search heuristic is based on iteratively\n performing
    a series of Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) moves, which\n allows to quickly
    navigate to the best-known ML tree. RAxML-NG is a successor\n of RAxML (Stamatakis
    2014) and leverages the highly optimized likelihood\n computation implemented
    in libpll (Flouri et al. 2014).\n .\n RAxML-NG offers improvements in speed, flexibility
    and user-friendliness\n over the previous RAxML versions. It also implements some
    of the\n features previously available in ExaML (Kozlov et al. 2015), including\n\
    \ checkpointing and efficient load balancing for partitioned alignments."
