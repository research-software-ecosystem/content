  description: explore and quantify relationships between clustering results
  long_description: " CompClust is a python package written using the pyMLX and IPlot
    APIs. It provides\n software tools to explore and quantify relationships between
    clustering results. Its\n development has been largely built around needs of microarray
    data analysis but could\n be easily used in other domains.\n .\n Briefly pyMLX
    provides for efficient and convenient execution of many clustering\n algorithms
    using a extendable library of algorithms. It also provides many-to-many\n linkages
    between data features and annotations (such as cluster labels, gene names,\n gene
    ontology information, etc.) These linkages persist through varied data\n manipulations.
    IPlot provides an abstraction of the plotting process in which any\n arbitrary
    feature or derived feature of the data can be projected onto any feature\n of
    the plot, including the X,Y coordinates of points, marker symbol, marker size,\n
    maker/line color, etc. These plots are intrinsically linked to the dataset, the\n
    View and the Labeling classes found within pyMLX."
