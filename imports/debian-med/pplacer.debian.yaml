  description: phylogenetic placement and downstream analysis
  long_description: " Pplacer places reads on a phylogenetic tree. guppy (Grand Unified\n
    Phylogenetic Placement Yanalyzer) yanalyzes them. rppr is a helpful tool\n for
    working with reference packages.\n .\n Pplacer places query sequences on a fixed
    reference phylogenetic tree to\n maximize phylogenetic likelihood or posterior
    probability according to a\n reference alignment. Pplacer is designed to be fast,
    to give useful\n information about uncertainty, and to offer advanced visualization
    and\n downstream analysis.\n"
