  description: sample sequence alignment corresponding to phylogeny
  long_description: " The PhySamp package currently contains two programs: bppphysamp,
    which\n samples sequences according to their similarity, and bppalnoptim, which\n
    samples a sequence alignment by removing sequences in order to maximize\n the
    number of sites suitable for a given analysis. The bppalnoptim\n program has three
    running modes:\n  * Interactive: the user will be iteratively proposed a set of
    choices\n    for sequence removal, with their corresponding site gains. The\n\
    \    procedure stops when the user does not want to remove more sequences,\n \
    \   and the resulting filtered alignment is written.\n  * Automatic: the user
    enters an a priori criterion for stopping\n    the filtering procedure (for instance
    a minimum number of\n    sequences to keep).\n  * Diagnostic: this mode allows
    one to plot the trade-off curve, by\n    showing the site gain as a function of
    the number of removed\n    sequences.\n"
