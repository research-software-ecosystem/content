  description: header and static library for reading & writing SLOW5 files
  long_description: " Slow5lib is a software library for reading & writing SLOW5 files.\n\
    \ Slow5lib is designed to facilitate use of data in SLOW5 format by third-\n party
    software packages. Existing packages that read/write data in FAST5\n format can
    be easily modified to support SLOW5.\n .\n SLOW5 is a new file format for storing
    signal data from Oxford Nanopore\n Technologies (ONT) devices. SLOW5 was developed
    to overcome inherent\n limitations in the standard FAST5 signal data format that
    prevent\n efficient, scalable analysis and cause many headaches for developers.\n\
    \ SLOW5 can be encoded in human-readable ASCII format, or a more compact\n and
    efficient binary format (BLOW5) - this is analogous to the seminal\n SAM/BAM format
    for storing DNA sequence alignments. The BLOW5 binary\n format supports *zlib*
    (DEFLATE) compression, or other compression\n methods, thereby minimising the
    data storage footprint while still\n permitting efficient parallel access. Detailed
    benchmarking experiments\n have shown that SLOW5 format is an order of magnitude
    faster and\n significantly smaller than FAST5.\n .\n This is the development package
    containing headers and static library.\n"
