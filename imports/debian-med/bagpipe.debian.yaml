  description: genomewide LD mapping
  long_description: " Bagpipe is a program for performing genomewide linkage disequilibrium\n\
    \ mapping of quantitative trait loci in populations whose genome structure\n can
    be accommodated in the HAPPY framework [Mott00]. This includes most\n diploid
    crosses where the founders of the individuals have known genotypes.\n .\n  * Bagpipe
    is a simplified and streamlined version of Bagphenotype that\n    does not currently
    include resample model averaging (RMA) capabilities.\n  * Bagpipe can help fit
    single locus regression models (with or without\n    random effects) to marker
    intervals whose genetic ancestry is inferred\n    using the HAPPY software.\n\
    \  * Bagpipe cannot help you decide what is a sensible model to fit.\n  * Bagpipe
    does not currently accommodate populations with significant\n    population structure,
    except through the specification of simple random\n    intercepts based on unpatterned
    covariance matrices.\n  * Bagpipe is named after the Scottish wind instrument
    \"the bagpipes\" and\n    after Bagphenotype, which in turn was a PIPEline for
    BAGging-based\n    multiple QTL analysis of phenoTYPEs. Bagphenotype was in turn
    based\n    on software written by Richard Mott and William Valdar to analyze\n\
    \    heterogeneous stock mice in [Valdar06].\n  * Bagpipe is experimental software,
    is provided free of charge subject to\n    copyleft restrictions, and comes with
    no guarantees whatsoever."
