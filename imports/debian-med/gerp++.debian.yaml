  description: identifies constrained elements in multiple alignments
  long_description: " GERP is a package for analyzing evolutionary rates and finding
    constrained\n elements in a multiple alignment.  It uses the notion of \"rejected\n\
    \ substitutions\" (RS) in order to quantify constraint at individual positions\n\
    \ as well as over elements spanning multiple positions.\n .\n GERP consists of
    two main components:  gerpcol, which analyzes multiple\n alignments and computes
    RS scores for all positions, and gerpelem, which\n finds constrained elements
    given the RS scores produced by gerpcol."
