  description: Mixture of Isoforms model for RNA-Seq isoform quantitation (Python
    3)
  long_description: " MISO (Mixture of Isoforms) is a probabilistic framework that
    quantitates\n the expression level of alternatively spliced genes from RNA-Seq\n\
    \ data, and identifies differentially regulated isoforms or exons across\n samples.
    By modeling the generative process by which reads are produced\n from isoforms
    in RNA-Seq, the MISO model uses Bayesian inference to\n compute the probability
    that a read originated from a particular isoform.\n .\n MISO uses the inferred
    assignment of reads to isoforms to quantitate the\n abundances of the underlying
    set of alternative mRNA isoforms. Confidence\n intervals over estimates can be
    obtained, which quantify the reliability\n of the estimates.\n .\n This is the
    Python 3 module."
