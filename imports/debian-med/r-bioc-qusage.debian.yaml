  description: 'qusage: Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene Expression'
  long_description: " This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set\n Analysis
    for Gene Expression (QuSAGE) method described in\n (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids
    Res, 2013). This is a novel Gene\n Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed
    to provide a\n faster, more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene\n
    expression studies. qusage accounts for inter-gene correlations\n using the Variance
    Inflation Factor technique proposed by Wu et\n al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012).
    In addition, rather than simply\n evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis
    with a single\n number (a P value), qusage quantifies gene set activity with a\n
    complete probability density function (PDF). From this PDF, P\n values and confidence
    intervals can be easily extracted.\n Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc
    analysis (e.g.,\n pair-wise comparisons of gene set activity) while maintaining\n
    statistical traceability. Finally, while qusage is compatible\n with individual
    gene statistics from existing methods (e.g.,\n LIMMA), a Welch-based method is
    implemented that is shown to\n improve specificity. For questions, contact Chris
    Bolen\n (cbolen1@gmail.com) or Steven Kleinstein\n (steven.kleinstein@yale.edu)\n"
