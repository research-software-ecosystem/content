  description: simultaneous haplotyping and genotyping
  long_description: " MarginPhase is a program for simultaneous haplotyping and genotyping.\n\
    \ It is an experimental, open source implementation written in C and\n developed
    to work primarily with nanopore data. The MarginPhase workflow\n includes an alignment
    summation step. This differentiates it from WhatsHap,\n which performs a local
    realignment around analyzed sites. MarginPhase can\n also phase genotypic variants
    simultaneously after filtering out the sites\n that are likely homozygous. MarginPhaseâ€™s
    output includes a BAM which\n encodes the phasing of each read, including which
    phase set it is in, \n which haplotype it belongs to, and what of the aligned
    portion falls \n into each phase set. Reads which span a phase set boundary have
    information \n for both encoded in them."
