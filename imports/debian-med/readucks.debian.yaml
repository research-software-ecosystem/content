  description: Nanopore read de-multiplexer (read demux -> readux -> readucks, innit)
  long_description: " This package is inspired by the demultiplexing options in\n\
    \ porechop but without the adapter trimming options - it just demuxes.\n It uses
    the parasail library with its Python bindings to do\n pairwise alignment which
    provides a considerable speed up over\n the seqan library used by porechop due
    to its low-level use\n of vector processor instructions.\n"
