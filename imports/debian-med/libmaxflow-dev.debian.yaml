  description: Development files for the maxflow-mincut algorithm
  long_description: " This library implements an efficient minimum cut/maximum flow\n
    algorithms on graphs that can be used for exact or approximate\n energy minimization
    in low-level vision. The algorithm provides a high\n performance that makes near
    real-time performance possible.\n This package provides the development files
    for the library.\n"
