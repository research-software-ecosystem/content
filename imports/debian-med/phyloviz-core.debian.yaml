  description: phylogenetic inference and data visualization for sequence based typing
    methods
  long_description: " Phyloviz allows the analysis of sequence-based typing methods
    that\n generate allelic profiles and their associated epidemiological data.\n\
    \ .\n For representing the possible evolutionary relationships between\n strains
    identified by allelic profiles it uses the goeBURST algorithm, a\n refinement
    of eBURST algorithm proposed by Feil et al., and its\n expansion to generate a
    complete minimum spanning tree (MST).\n .\n Phyloviz is being developed in a modular
    way to allow its expansion\n with novel data analysis algorithms and new visualization
    modules.\n .\n Capabilities\n  * Modularity allows the creation of plugins to
    analyse different types of data\n  * Allows the visualization of data overlaid
    onto goeBURST and MST results\n  * Confidence assessment of each link in the graph\n\
    \  * Query the data and see the query results directly onto the graphs\n  * Search
    your data set using regular expressions to select what to display\n  * Export
    the results as images in various formats: eps, png, gif, pdf, etc"
