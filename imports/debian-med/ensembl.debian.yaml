  long_description: " Ensembl is a joint project of the Sanger Center and the European\n\
    \ Bioinformatics Institute, an outstation of the European Molecular\n Biology
    Laboratory, (EMBL-EBI) that are sharing a campus in Hinxton\n near Cambridge,
    UK. It presents the sequence data for the\n yet available complete genomes of
    many vertebrates and is helped\n by many sister-projects to cover also plants,
    invertebrates\n and bacteria.\n .\n This package provides a basic installation
    of Ensembl. It comprises\n a full copy of the public Ensembl website, minus Blast
    and SSAHA,\n and minus BioMart. It uses UniSearch instead of the engine used on
    the\n public site for searching by keyword. It connects directly to the public\n\
    \ databases hosted by the EBI/Sanger.\n .\n This is meant as an easy way to get
    a basic Ensembl installation\n working on Debian. It can then be customised to
    local requirements.\n . \n Note that Ensembl has two odd dependencies: bioperl1.2.3
    and\n libparallel-useragent-perl. Those are not required for routine\n browsing,
    but the bioperl1.2.3 library performs the parsing of BLAST\n outputs. Version
    1.2.3 is in conflict with any other existing bioperl\n installation and forces
    you to effectively downgrade.\n .\n libwww-perl5.808  will conflict with the latest
    libwww-perl installation\n and thus force a downgrade to 5.808, which will disable
    many other tools\n on your system. Therefore it is advisable NOT to install this
    package\n in parallel with any other software, and/or use a virtual machine or\n\
    \ dedicated machine.\n .\n WARNING: Requires internet connection both to install
    and to run, as it\n connects to the Sanger/EBI database servers during both installation\
    \ \n and at runtime."
