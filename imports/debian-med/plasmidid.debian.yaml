  description: mapping-based, assembly-assisted plasmid identification tool
  long_description: " PlasmidID is a mapping-based, assembly-assisted plasmid identification\n
    tool that analyzes and gives graphic solution for plasmid\n identification.\n
    .\n PlasmidID is a computational pipeline that maps Illumina reads over\n plasmid
    database sequences. The k-mer filtered, most covered\n sequences are clustered
    by identity to avoid redundancy and the\n longest are used as scaffold for plasmid
    reconstruction. Reads are\n assembled and annotated by automatic and specific
    annotation. All\n information generated from mapping, assembly, annotation and
    local\n alignment analyses is gathered and accurately represented in a\n circular
    image which allow user to determine plasmidic composition in\n any bacterial sample.\n"
