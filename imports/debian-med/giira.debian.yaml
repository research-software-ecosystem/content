  description: RNA-Seq driven gene finding incorporating ambiguous reads
  long_description: " GIIRA is a gene prediction method that identifies potential
    coding\n regions exclusively based on the mapping of reads from an RNA-Seq\n experiment.\
    \  It was foremost designed for prokaryotic gene prediction\n and is able to resolve
    genes within the expressed region of an operon.\n However, it is also applicable
    to eukaryotes and predicts exon intron\n structures as well as alternative isoforms."
