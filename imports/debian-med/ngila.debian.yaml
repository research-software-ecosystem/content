  description: global pairwise alignments with logarithmic and affine gap costs
  long_description: " Ngila is an application that will find the best alignment of
    a pair\n of sequences using log-affine gap costs, which are the most\n biologically
    realistic gap costs.\n .\n Ngila implements the Miller and Myers (1988) algorithm
    in order to\n find a least costly global alignment of two sequences given homology\n\
    \ costs and a gap cost. Two versions of the algorithm are\n included: holistic
    and divide-and-conquer. The former is faster but\n the latter utilizes less memory.
    Ngila starts with the\n divide-and-conquer method but switches to the holistic
    method for\n subsequences smaller than a user-established threshold. This improves\n\
    \ its speed without substantially increasing memory requirements. Ngila\n also
    allows users to assign costs to end gaps that are smaller than\n costs for internal
    gaps. This is important for aligning using the\n free-end-gap method."
