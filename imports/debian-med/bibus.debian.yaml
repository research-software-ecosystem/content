  description: bibliographic database
  long_description: " Bibus is a bibliographic database which has been developed with
    LibreOffice/\n OpenOffice.org in mind. It can directly insert citations and format
    the\n bibliographic index in an open OpenOffice.org Writer document. The main\n\
    \ features are\n  * hierarchical organization of the references with user-defined
    keys\n  * designed for multiuser-environments (share databases between users)\n\
    \  * a search engine supporting live queries\n  * on-line PubMed access\n  * import
    of PubMed (Medline), EndNote/Refer, RIS and BibTeX records.\n .\n Bibus will use
    an SQLite-database by default for storage (via the SQLite3\n module available
    in Python >2.5). But it also supports MySQL-databases.\n If you want to use a
    MySQL-database, make sure, that you have the\n python-mysqldb package installed."
