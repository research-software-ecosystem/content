  description: Removal of Spurious Antisense in biological RNA sequences
  long_description: " In stranded RNA-Seq experiments it is possible to detect and\n
    measure antisense transcription, important since antisense transcripts\n impact
    gene transcription in several different ways. Stranded RNA-Seq\n determines the
    strand from which an RNA fragment originates, and so can\n be used to identify
    where antisense transcription may be implicated in\n gene regulation.\n .\n However,
    spurious antisense reads are often present in experiments, and\n can manifest
    at levels greater than 1% of sense transcript levels. This\n is enough to disrupt
    analyses by causing false antisense counts to\n dominate the set of genes with
    high antisense transcription levels.\n .\n The RoSA (Removal of Spurious Antisense)
    tool detects the presence of\n high levels of spurious antisense transcripts,
    by:\n  * analysing ERCC spike-in data to find the ratio of antisense:sense\n \
    \   transcripts in the spike-ins; or\n  * using antisense and sense counts around
    splice sites to provide a\n    set of gene-specific estimates; or\n  * both.\n
    .\n Once RoSA has an estimate of the spurious antisense, expressed as a\n ratio
    of antisense:sense counts, RoSA will calculate a correction to\n the antisense
    counts based on the ratio. Where a gene-specific estimate\n is available for a
    gene, it will be used in preference to the global\n estimate obtained from either
    spike-ins or spliced reads.\n .\n This package provides the library for the statistics
    suite R."
