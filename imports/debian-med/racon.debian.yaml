  description: consensus module for raw de novo DNA assembly of long uncorrected reads
  long_description: " Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct
    raw\n contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a\n consensus
    step. The goal of Racon is to generate genomic consensus which\n is of similar
    or better quality compared to the output generated by\n assembly methods which
    employ both error correction and consensus steps,\n while providing a speedup
    of several times compared to those methods. It\n supports data produced by both
    Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore\n Technologies.\n .\n Racon can be used
    as a polishing tool after the assembly with either\n Illumina data or data produced
    by third generation of sequencing. The\n type of data inputed is automatically
    detected.\n .\n Racon takes as input only three files: contigs in FASTA/FASTQ
    format,\n reads in FASTA/FASTQ format and overlaps/alignments between the reads\n
    and the contigs in MHAP/PAF/SAM format. Output is a set of polished\n contigs
    in FASTA format printed to stdout. All input files can be\n compressed with gzip.\n
    .\n Racon can also be used as a read error-correction tool. In this\n scenario,
    the MHAP/PAF/SAM file needs to contain pairwise overlaps\n between reads including
    dual overlaps.\n .\n A wrapper script is also available to enable easier usage
    to the end-\n user for large datasets. It has the same interface as racon but
    adds\n two additional features from the outside. Sequences can be subsampled\n
    to decrease the total execution time (accuracy might be lower) while\n target
    sequences can be split into smaller chunks and run sequentially\n to decrease
    memory consumption. Both features can be run at the same\n time as well.\n"
