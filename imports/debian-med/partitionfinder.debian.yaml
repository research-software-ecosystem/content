  description: choses partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution for sequence
    data
  long_description: " PartitionFinder and PartitionFinderProtein are Python programs
    for\n simultaneously choosing partitioning schemes and models of molecular evolution\n\
    \ for sequence data.  You can use them before running a phylogenetic analysis,\n\
    \ in order to decide how to divide up your sequence data into separate blocks\n\
    \ before analysis, and to simultaneously perform model selection on each of\n\
    \ those blocks."
