  description: PWM enrichment analysis
  long_description: " A toolkit of high-level functions for DNA motif scanning\n and
    enrichment analysis built upon Biostrings. The main\n functionality is PWM enrichment
    analysis of already known PWMs\n (e.g. from databases such as MotifDb), but the
    package also\n implements high-level functions for PWM scanning and\n visualisation.
    The package does not perform \"de novo\" motif\n discovery, but is instead focused
    on using motifs that are\n either experimentally derived or computationally constructed
    by\n other tools.\n"
