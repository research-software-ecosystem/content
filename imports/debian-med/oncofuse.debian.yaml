  description: predicting oncogenic potential of gene fusions
  long_description: " Oncofuse is a framework designed to estimate the oncogenic potential
    of\n de-novo discovered gene fusions. It uses several hallmark features and\n
    employs a bayesian classifier to provide the probability of a given gene\n fusion
    being a driver mutation."
