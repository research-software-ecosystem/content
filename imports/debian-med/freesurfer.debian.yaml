  description: analysis and visualization of functional brain imaging data
  long_description: " FreeSurfer is a set of tools for analysis and visualization
    of\n structural and functional brain imaging data. It contains a fully\n automatic
    structural stream for processing cross sectional and\n longitudinal data.\n .\n
    FreeSurfer provides many anatomical analysis tools, including:\n representation
    of the cortical surface between white and gray matter,\n representation of the
    pial surface, segmentation of white matter from\n the rest of the brain, skull
    stripping, B1 bias field correction,\n nonlinear registration of the cortical
    surface of an individual with\n an sterotaxic atlas, labeling of regions of the
    cortical surface,\n statistical analysis of group morphometry differences, and
    labeling of\n subcortical brain structures, etc.\n .\n This package depends upon
