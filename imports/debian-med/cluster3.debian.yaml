  description: Reimplementation of the Eisen-clustering software
  long_description: " The open source clustering software available here contains
    clustering\n routines that can be used to analyze gene expression data. Routines
    for\n hierarchical (pairwise simple, complete, average, and centroid linkage)\n
    clustering, k-means and k-medians clustering, and 2D self-organizing maps\n are
    included. The routines are available in the form of a C clustering\n library,
    an extension module to Python, a module to Perl, as well as an\n enhanced version
    of Cluster, which was originally developed by Michael\n Eisen of Berkeley Lab.
    The C clustering library and the associated\n extension module for Python was
    released under the Python license. The\n Perl module was released under the Artistic
    License. Cluster 3.0 is\n covered by the original Cluster/TreeView license.\n
    .\n This package only contains the command line and motif gui versions\n of Cluster
    3.0.\n"
