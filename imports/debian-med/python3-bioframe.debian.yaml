  description: library to enable flexible, scalable operations on genomic interval
    dataframes
  long_description: " Building bioframe directly on top of pandas enables immediate
    access\n to a rich set of dataframe operations. Working in Python enables\n rapid
    visualization (e.g. matplotlib, seaborn) and iteration of\n genomic analyses.\n
    .\n Bioframe implements a variety of genomic interval operations directly on\n
    dataframes. Bioframe also includes functions for loading diverse genomic\n data
    formats, and performing operations on special classes of genomic\n intervals,
    including chromosome arms and fixed size bins.\n"
