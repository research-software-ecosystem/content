  description: parser for gene transfer format (aka GFF2)
  long_description: " You find a gene in the genome? Or a feature about it?\n The
    gene transfer format (GTF, identical to GFF2)\n allows your program or your database
    to exchange\n this information so it can be presented with genome\n browsers or
    used e.g. as a selection for other features\n like nucleotide variants.\n .\n
    This package provides a parser for GTF/GFF2 files, i.e.\n sets of routines that
    read that file and support the\n computational interpretation of these data.\n"
