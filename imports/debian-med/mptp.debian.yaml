  description: single-locus species delimitation
  long_description: " Implementation of a fast species delimitation method, based
    on PTP\n (Zhang et al. 2013) with a 64-bit multi-threaded design that handles\n\
    \ very large datasets.\n .\n The tool mPTP can handle very large biodiversity
    datasets. It implements\n a fast method to compute the ML delimitation from an
    inferred\n phylogenetic tree of the samples. Using MCMC, it also computes the\n\
    \ support values for each clade, which can be used to assess the\n confidence
    of the ML delimitation.\n .\n ML delimitation mPTP implements two flavours of
    the point-estimate\n solution. First, it implements the original method from (Zhang
    et al.\n 2013) where all within-species processes are modelled with a single\n\
    \ exponential distribution. mPTP uses a dynamic programming implementation\n which
    estimates the ML delimitation faster and more accurately than the\n original PTP.
    The dynamic programming implementation has similar\n properties as (Gulek et al.
    2010). See the wiki for more information.\n The second method assumes a distinct
    exponential distribution for the\n branching events of each of the delimited species
    allowing it to fit to\n a wider range of empirical datasets.\n .\n MCMC method
    mPTP generates support values for each clades. They\n represent the ratio of the
    number of samples for which a particular node\n was in the between-species process,
    to the total number of samples.\n"
