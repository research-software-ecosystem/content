  description: analysis of small RNA in NGS data
  long_description: " Seqcluster investigates small RNA sequences of all sorts in
    RNA\n sequencing data. This is especially helpful for the identification of\n
    RNA that is neither coding nor belonging to the already well-established\n group
    of miRNA, towards many tools feel constrained to.\n"
