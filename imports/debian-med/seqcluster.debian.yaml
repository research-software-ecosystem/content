  description: analysis of small RNA in NGS data
  long_description: " Seqcluster investigates small RNA sequences of all sorts in
    RNA\n sequencing data. This is especially helpful for the identification of\n\
    \ RNA that is neither coding nor belonging to the already well-established\n group
    of miRNA, towards many tools feel constrained to.\n"
