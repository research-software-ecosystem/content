  description: Subset of Galaxy core code base designed to be used
  long_description: " A small subset of the Galaxy project for reuse outside the core.\n
    The Galaxy software framework enables researchers without informatics\n expertise
    to perform computational analyses through the web. A user interacts\n with Galaxy
    through the web by uploading and analyzing the data. Galaxy\n interacts with underlying
    computational infrastructure (servers that run the\n analyses and disks that store
    the data) without exposing it to the user."
