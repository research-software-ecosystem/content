  description: Interactive Visual Analytics Tool for Genome Assemblies
  long_description: " Genome assembly remains an inexact science. Even when accomplished\n\
    \ with the best software available, the assembly of a genome often\n contains
    numerous errors, both small and large. Hawkeye is a visual\n analytics tool for
    genome assembly analysis and validation, designed\n to aid in identifying and
    correcting assembly errors. Hawkeye blends\n the best practices from information
    and scientific visualization to\n facilitate inspection of large-scale assembly
    data while minimizing\n the time needed to detect mis-assemblies and make accurate
    judgments\n of assembly quality.\n .\n All levels of the assembly data hierarchy
    are made accessible to\n users, along with summary statistics and common assembly
    metrics. A\n ranking component guides investigation towards likely mis-assemblies\n\
    \ or interesting features to support the task at hand. Wherever\n possible, high-level
    overviews, dynamic filtering, and automated\n clustering are leveraged to focus
    attention and highlight anomalies\n in the data. Hawkeyes effectiveness has been
    proven on several genome\n projects, where it has been used both to improve quality
    and to\n validate the correctness of complex genomes.\n .\n Hawkeye is compatible
    with most widely used assemblers, including\n Phrap, ARACHNE, Celera Assembler,
    Newbler, AMOS, and assemblies\n deposited in the NCBI Assembly Archive."
