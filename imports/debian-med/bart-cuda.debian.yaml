  description: tools for computational magnetic resonance imaging
  long_description: " The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free
    and\n open-source image-reconstruction framework for Computational Magnetic\n
    Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming library and a toolbox\n of command-line
    programs. The library provides common operations on\n multi-dimensional arrays,
    Fourier and wavelet transforms, as well as\n generic implementations of iterative
    optimization algorithms. The\n command-line tools provide direct access to basic
    operations on\n multi-dimensional arrays as well as efficient implementations
    of\n many calibration and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging,\n compressed
    sensing, and machine learning.\n .\n This package provides BART with CUDA support.\n"
