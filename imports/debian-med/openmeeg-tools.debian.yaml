  long_description: " OpenMEEG consists of state-of-the art solvers for forward problems
    in\n the field of MEG and EEG.  Solvers are based on the symmetric\n Boundary
    Element method [Kybic et al, 2005], providing excellent\n accuracy, particularly
    for superficial cortical sources. OpenMEEG can\n compute four types of lead fields
    (EEG, MEG, Internal Potential and\n Electrical Impedence Tomography).\n .\n This
    package provides command line interface to openmeeg functionality."
