  description: Computerized Anatomical Reconstruction and Editing Toolkit
  long_description: " This software allows for creating, viewing and manipulating
    surface\n reconstructions of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, viewing volumes
    and for\n displaying experimental data on the surfaces and volumes. While Caret
    is\n primarily a GUI application with 'caret_command' there is also a versatile\n\
    \ command line tool, that allows access to a substantial proportion of Caret's\n\
    \ functionality.\n .\n Caret can download and use stereotaxic atlases (human,
    monkey, mouse and rat)\n from an open online database.\n .\n Some functionality
    of Caret is only available when additional data files,\n provided by the caret-data
    package, are available. This includes:\n .\n  - Map volumes to surface via PALS
    atlas\n  - Multi-resolution morphing\n  - Projection of foci via PALS atlas\n\
    \  - Surface-based registration\n  - Surface flattening\n .\n Currently the caret-data
    package is only available from the NeuroDebian\n repository. Please see http://neuro.debian.net
    for more information."
