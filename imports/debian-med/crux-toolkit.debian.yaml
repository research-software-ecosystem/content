  description: toolkit for tandem mass spectrometry analysis
  long_description: " The Crux mass spectrometry analysis toolkit is an open source
    project\n that aims to provide users with a cross-platform suite of analysis tools\n
    for interpreting protein mass spectrometry data. The toolkit includes\n several
    search engines for both standard and cross-linked database\n search, as well as
    a variety of pre- and post-processing engines for\n assigning high-resolution
    precursor masses to spectra, assigning\n statistical confidence estimates to spectra,
    peptides and proteins, and\n performing label free quantification."
