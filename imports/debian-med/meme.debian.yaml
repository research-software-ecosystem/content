  description: search for common motifs in DNA or protein sequences
  long_description: " MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation) is a tool for discovering\n\
    \ motifs in a group of related DNA or protein sequences.  A motif is a\n sequence
    pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group of related protein or\n DNA sequences.
    MEME represents motifs as position-dependent\n letter-probability matrices which
    describe the probability of each\n possible letter at each position in the pattern.
    Individual MEME motifs\n do not contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps
    are split by\n MEME into two or more separate motifs.\n .\n MEME takes as input
    a group of DNA or protein sequences (the training set)\n and outputs as many motifs
    as requested. MEME uses statistical modeling\n techniques to automatically choose
    the best width, number of occurrences,\n and description for each motif."
