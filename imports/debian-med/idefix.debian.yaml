  description: index checking for improved demultiplexing of NGS data
  long_description: " IDeFIX is a tool for demultiplexing Illumina NGS data.\n .\n\
    \ It reports inconsistencies between the raw data and the Sample Sheet,\n checks
    for duplicates of indices/ index combinations in the latter and\n removes unwanted
    characters from it. Apart from messages printed on the\n terminal, IDeFIX creates
    an IDeFIX_Report.csv containing the indices/\n index combinations from the raw
    data and their abundance as well as\n their count in the Sample Sheet and the
    corresponding Index ID(s). This\n file is stored in the project folder."
