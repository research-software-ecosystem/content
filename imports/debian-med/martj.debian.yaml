  description: distributed data integration system for biological data
  long_description: " BioMart is a simple, distributed data integration system with
    powerful\n query capabilities. The BioMart data model has been applied\n to the
    following data sources: UniProt Proteomes, Macromolecular\n Structure Database
    (MSD), Ensembl, Vega, and dbSNP.\n .\n It has been designed to provide researchers
    with an easy and interactive\n access to both the wealth of data available on
    the Internet and for\n in house data integration. BioMart is a successor to the
    generic\n query system originally developed for the Ensembl genome database\n\
    \ (EnsMart). Building on its success, BioMart, has now been applied to\n other
    biological databases."
