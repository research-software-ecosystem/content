  description: Sequence Search and Alignment by Hashing Algorithm
  long_description: " SSAHA is a software tool for very fast matching and alignment
    of DNA\n sequences. It achieves its fast search speed by converting sequence\n\
    \ information into a `hash table' data structure, which can then be\n searched
    very rapidly for matches.\n .\n SSAHA is the only free software of its category
    (fast search of nearly\n indentical sequences). The popular alternative, BLAT,
    is restricted to\n non-commercial use."
