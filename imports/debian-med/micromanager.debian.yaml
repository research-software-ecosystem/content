  long_description: " µManager is a software package for control of automated microscopes.
    It lets\n you execute common microscope image acquisition strategies such as time-lapses,\n\
    \ multi-channel imaging, z-stacks, and combinations thereof. μManager works with\n\
    \ microscopes from all four major manufacturers (Leica, Nikon, Olympus and\n Zeiss),
    most scientific-grade cameras and many peripherals (stages, filter\n wheels, shutters,
    etc.) used in microscope imaging (check the list of supported\n hardware). Since
    μManager runs as a plugin to ImageJ, image analysis routines\n are available within
    the application.\n .\n Unencumbered code provides a GUI for microscope image acquisition,
    a hardware\n interface layer and hardware interfacing for:\n  - ASI stages, filter
    wheels and shutters\n  - Arduino\n  - Conix filter changer\n  - Velleman K8055
    and K8061 digital IO boards\n  - Leica DMI microscopes\n  - Ludl shutters, stages
    and filter Wheels\n  - Nikon TE2000 microscope\n  - Physik Instrumente stages\n\
    \  - Pecon stage incubators\n  - Prior shutters, stages and filter wheels\n  -
    Spectral LMM5 laser controller\n  - Sutter shutters, filter wheels and DG4\n \
    \ - Vincent Uniblitz shutters\n  - Yokogawa spinning disk confocal CSU22 and CSUX\n\
    \  - Zeiss microscopes (two 'generations')\n  - iidc1394 compatible cameras (through
    libdc1394)"
