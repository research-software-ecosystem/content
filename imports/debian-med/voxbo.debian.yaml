  long_description: " This is a toolkit for analysis of functional neuroimaging (chiefly\n\
    \ fMRI) experiments and voxel-based lesion-behavior mapping. VoxBo\n supports
    the modified GLM (for autocorrelated data), as well as the\n standard GLM for
    non-autocorrelated data. The toolkit is designed to be\n interoperable with AFNI,
    FSL, SPM and others."
