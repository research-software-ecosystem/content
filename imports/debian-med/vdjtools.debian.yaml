  description: framework for post-analysis of B/T cell repertoires
  long_description: " VDJtools is an open-source Java/Groovy-based framework designed\n\
    \ to facilitate analysis of immune repertoire sequencing (RepSeq)\n data. VDJtools
    computes a wide set of statistics and is able to perform\n various forms of cross-sample
    analysis. Both comprehensive tabular\n output and publication-ready plots are
    provided.\n .\n The main aims of the VDJtools Project are:\n .\n  * To ensure
    consistency between post-analysis methods and results\n  * To save the time of
    bioinformaticians analyzing RepSeq data\n  * To create an API framework facilitating
    development of new RepSeq\n    analysis applications\n  * To provide a simple
    enough command line tool so it could be used by\n    immunologists and biologists
    with little computational background\n"
