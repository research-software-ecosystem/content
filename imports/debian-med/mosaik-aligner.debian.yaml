  description: reference-guided aligner for next-generation sequencing
  long_description: " MosaikBuild converts various sequence formats into Mosaikâ€™s
    native read\n format. MosaikAligner pairwise aligns each read to a specified series
    of\n reference sequences. MosaikSort resolves paired-end reads and sorts the\n\
    \ alignments by the reference sequence coordinates. Finally, MosaikText\n converts
    alignments to different text-based formats.\n .\n At this time, the workflow consists
    of supplying sequences in FASTA,\n FASTQ, Illumina Bustard & Gerald, or SRF file
    formats and producing\n results in the BLAT axt, the BAM/SAM, the UCSC Genome
    Browser bed, or\n the Illumina ELAND formats."
