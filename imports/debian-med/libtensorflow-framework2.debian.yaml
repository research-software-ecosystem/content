  description: Computation using data flow graphs for scalable machine learning
  long_description: " TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical
    computation\n using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations,\n\
    \ while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)\n\
    \ that flow between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy\n computation
    to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile\n device without rewriting
    code.\n .\n This package ships shared object libtensorflow_framework.so.2.0\n\
    \ .\n A shared object which includes registration mechanisms for ops and\n kernels.
    Does not include the implementations of any ops or kernels.\n Instead, the library
    which loads libtensorflow_framework.so\n (e.g. _pywrap_tensorflow_internal.so
    for Python, libtensorflow.so for the C\n API) is responsible for registering ops
    with libtensorflow_framework.so. In\n addition to this core set of ops, user libraries
    which are loaded (via\n TF_LoadLibrary/tf.load_op_library) register their ops
    and kernels with this\n shared object directly.\n .\n For example, from Python
    tf.load_op_library loads a custom op library (via\n dlopen() on Linux), the library
    finds libtensorflow_framework.so (no\n filesystem search takes place, since libtensorflow_framework.so
    has already\n been loaded by pywrap_tensorflow) and registers its ops and kernels
    via\n REGISTER_OP and REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER (which use symbols from\n libtensorflow_framework.so),
    and pywrap_tensorflow can then use these\n ops. Since other languages use the
    same libtensorflow_framework.so, op\n libraries are language agnostic.\n"
