  description: SEQUEST Searching for Peptide Identification from Tandem Mass Spectra
  long_description: " Tide implements the SEQUEST algorithm for peptide identification
    and\n that achieves a dramatic speedup over Crux and SEQUEST. The\n optimization
    strategies detailed here employ a combination of\n algorithmic and software engineering
    techniques to achieve speeds up to\n 170 times faster than a recent version of
    SEQUEST that uses indexing.\n For example, on a single Xeon CPU, Tide searches
    10,000 spectra against\n a tryptic database of 27,499\n C.\\ elegans proteins
    at a rate of 1,550 spectra per second, which\n compares favorably with a rate
    of 8.8 spectra per second for a recent\n version of SEQUEST with index running
    on the same hardware."
