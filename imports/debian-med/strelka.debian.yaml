  description: strelka2 germline and somatic small variant caller
  long_description: " Strelka2 is a fast and accurate small variant caller optimized
    for\n analysis of germline variation in small cohorts and somatic variation in\n\
    \ tumor/normal sample pairs. The germline caller employs an efficient\n tiered
    haplotype model to improve accuracy and provide read-backed\n phasing, adaptively
    selecting between assembly and a faster alignment-\n based haplotyping approach
    at each variant locus. The germline caller\n also analyzes input sequencing data
    using a mixture-model indel error\n estimation method to improve robustness to
    indel noise. The somatic\n calling model improves on the original Strelka method
    for liquid and late-\n stage tumor analysis by accounting for possible tumor cell
    contamination\n in the normal sample. A final empirical variant re-scoring step
    using\n random forest models trained on various call quality features has been\n\
    \ added to both callers to further improve precision."
