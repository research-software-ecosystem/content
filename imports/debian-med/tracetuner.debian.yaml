  description: interpretation of DNA Sanger sequencing data
  long_description: " Tracetuner is a tool for base and quality calling of trace files
    from\n DNA sequencing instruments.\n Traditional DNA sequencing yields curves
    from four different\n channels or light frequencies that human or (preferably)
    machines\n are interpreting to determine the actual base (A,C,G or T) and\n the
    confidence with which this is determined.\n .\n TraceTuner is a DNA sequencing
    quality value, base calling and trace\n processing software application originally
    developed by Paracel,\n Inc. While providing a flexible interface and capability
    to adopt\n the \"pure\" base calls produced by Phred, KB or any other \"original\"\
    \n caller, it offers competitive features not currently available in other\n tools,
    such as customized calibration of quality values, advanced\n heterozygote and
    mixed base calling and deconvolving the \"mixed\"\n electropherograms resulting
    from the presence of indels into a couple of\n \"pure\" electropherograms.\n .\n
    Later versions\n Previous versions of TraceTuner were used by\n Celera Genomics
    to process over 27 million reads from both Drosophila\n and human genome projects.\n
    In 2000, Applied Biosystems\n bundled TraceTuner with ABI3700 Genome Analyzers
    and shipped it to the\n customers of these capillary electrophoresis sequencers.\n
    its SNP detection and genotyping software product SeqScape.\n .\n TraceTuner implements
    an advanced peak processing technology for resolving\n overlapping peaks of the
    same dye color into individual, or \"intrinsic\"\n peaks. TraceTuner, for its
    support of mixed base calling, have been used by\n the research community, the
    private biotech sector, and the U.S. government\n as components of different variant
    detection, genotyping and forensic\n software applications (e.g. Applied Biosystems
    SeqScape, Paracel Genome\n Assembler, MTexpert, etc.).\n .\n This technology was
    protected by US Patent #6,681,186. Currently,\n TraceTuner is an open source software,
    which has been used by J. Craig\n Venter Institute's DNA Sequencing and Resequencing
    pipelines.\n .\n This package prepares an important piece of human history to
    be used\n with new data on new machines or to revisit older observations..\n"

  description: Fortolkning af DNA Sanger-sekventeringsdata
  long_description: " Tracetunner er et værktøj for »base and quality«-kald af trace-filer
    fra\n DNS-sekventeringsinstrumenter.\n Traditionel DNA-sekventering giver kurver
    fra fire forskellige kanaler\n eller lette frekvenser, som et menneske eller (mere
    sandsynligt) en maskine\n kan fortolke for at bestemme den faktiske base (A,C,G
    eller T) og konfidens\n som dette er bestemt med.\n"
