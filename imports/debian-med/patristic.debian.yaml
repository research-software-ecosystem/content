  description: Calculate patristic distances and comparing the components of genetic
    change
  long_description: " Patristic overcomes some logistic barriers to analysing signals
    in\n sequences. In additional to calculating patristic distances, it provides\n\
    \ plots for any combination of matrices, calculates commonly used\n statistics,
    allows data such as isolation dates to be entered and\n reorders matrices with
    matching species or gene labels. It will be used\n to analyse rates of mutation
    and substitutional saturation and the\n evolution of viruses."
