  description: demultiplexing barcoded Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads
  long_description: " Deepbinner is a tool for demultiplexing barcoded Oxford Nanopore\n
    sequencing reads. It does this with a deep convolutional neural network\n classifier,
    using many of the architectural advances that have proven\n successful in image
    classification. Unlike other demultiplexers (e.g.\n Albacore and Porechop), Deepbinner
    identifies barcodes from the raw\n signal (a.k.a. squiggle) which gives it greater
    sensitivity and fewer\n unclassified reads.\n .\n Reasons to use Deepbinner:\n\
    \  * To minimise the number of unclassified reads (use Deepbinner\n    by itself).\n\
    \  * To minimise the number of misclassified reads (use Deepbinner in\n    conjunction
    with Albacore demultiplexing).\n  * You plan on running signal-level downstream
    analyses, like\n    Nanopolish. Deepbinner can demultiplex the fast5 files which
    makes\n    this easier. Reasons to not use Deepbinner:\n  * You only have basecalled
    reads not the raw fast5 files (which\n    Deepbinner requires).\n  * You have
    a small/slow computer. Deepbinner is more computationally\n    intensive than
    Porechop.\n  * You used a sequencing/barcoding kit other than the ones Deepbinner\n\
    \    was trained on."
