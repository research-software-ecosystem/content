  description: pipeline to generate consensus sequences from NGS reads
  long_description: " CovPipe is a pipeline to generate consensus sequences from NGS
    reads\n based on a reference sequence. The pipeline is tailored to be used for\n\
    \ SARS-CoV-2 data, but may be used for other viruses.\n .\n Genomic variants of
    your NGS data in comparison to a reference will be\n determined. These variants
    will be included into the reference and form\n the consensus sequences. See below
    for further details on the determined\n set of consensus sequences."
