  long_description: " BioImage Suite has extensive capabilities for both neuro/cardiac\n\
    \ and abdominal image analysis and state of the art visualization.\n Many packages
    are available that are highly extensible, and provide\n functionality for image
    visualization and registration, surface\n editing, cardiac 4D multi-slice editing,
    diffusion tensor image\n processing, mouse segmentation and registration, and
    much more. It\n can be integrated with other biomedical image processing software,\n\
    \ such as FSL and SPM. This site provides information, downloads,\n documentation,
