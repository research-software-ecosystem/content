  description: microbial Tree of Life using 400 universal proteins
  long_description: " PhyloPhlAn is a computational pipeline for reconstructing highly\n\
    \ accurate and resolved phylogenetic trees based on whole-genome sequence\n information.
    The pipeline is scalable to thousands of genomes and uses\n the most conserved
    400 proteins for extracting the phylogenetic signal.\n PhyloPhlAn also implements
    taxonomic curation, estimation, and insertion\n operations.\n .\n The main features
    of PhyloPhlAn are:\n  * completely automatic, as the user needs only to provide
    the\n    (unannotated) protein sequences of the input genomes (as multifasta\n\
    \    files of peptides - not nucleotides)\n  * very high topological accuracy
    and resolution because of the use of\n    up to 400 previously identified most
    conserved proteins\n  * the possibility of integrating new genomes in the already\n\
    \    reconstructed most comprehensive tree of life (3,171 microbial\n    genomes)\n\
    \  * taxonomy estimation for the newly inserted genomes\n  * taxonomic curation
    for the produced phylogenetic trees"
