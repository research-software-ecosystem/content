  description: HMM-HDP models for MinION signal alignments
  long_description: " MinION signal-level alignment and methylation detection using
    hidden\n Markov Models with hierarchical Dirichlet process kmer learning.\n .\n\
    \ Nanopore sequencing is based on the principal of isolating a nanopore in\n a
    membrane separating buffered salt solutions, then applying a voltage\n across
    the membrane and monitoring the ionic current through the\n nanopore. The Oxford
    Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequences DNA by\n recording the ionic current
    as DNA strands are enzymatically guided\n through the nanopore. SignalAlign will
    align the ionic current from the\n MinION to a reference sequence using a trainable
    hidden Markov model\n (HMM). The emissions model for the HMM can either be the
    table of\n parametric normal distributions provided by ONT or a hierarchical\n\
    \ Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture of normal distributions. The HDP models\n enable
    mapping of methylated bases to your reference sequence."
