  description: describing selection and recombination in sequences
  long_description: " OmegaMap is a program for detecting natural selection and recombination\n
    in DNA or RNA sequences.  It is based on a model of population\n genetics and
    molecular evolution.  The signature of natural selection\n is determined by the
    relative excess of non-synonymous to synonymous\n polymorphisms.  The signature
    of recombination is detected from the\n patterns of linkage disequilibrium."
