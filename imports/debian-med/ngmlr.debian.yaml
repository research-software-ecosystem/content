  description: CoNvex Gap-cost alignMents for Long Reads
  long_description: " Ngmlr is a long-read mapper designed to sensitively align PacBilo
    or\n Oxford Nanopore to (large) reference genomes. It was designed to quickly\n\
    \ and correctly align the reads, including those spanning (complex)\n structural
    variations. Ngmlr uses an SV aware k-mer search to find\n approximate mapping
    locations for a read and then a banded Smith-\n Waterman alignment algorithm to
    compute the final alignment. Ngmlr uses\n a convex gap cost model that penalizes
    gap extensions for longer gaps\n less than for shorter ones to compute precise
    alignments.\n"
