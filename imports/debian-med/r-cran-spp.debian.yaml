  description: GNU R ChIP-seq processing pipeline
  long_description: " R package for anlaysis of ChIP-seq and other functional sequencing
    data\n  * Assess overall DNA-binding signals in the data and select appropriate\n\
    \    quality of tag alignment.\n  * Discard or restrict positions with abnormally
    high number of tags.\n  * Calculate genome-wide profiles of smoothed tag density
    and save them\n    in WIG files for viewing in other browsers.\n  * Calculate
    genome-wide profiles providing conservative statistical\n    estimates of fold
    enrichment ratios along the genome. These can be\n    exported for browser viewing,
    or thresholded to determine regions of\n    significant enrichment/depletion.\n\
    \  * Determine statistically significant point binding positions\n  * Assess whether
    the set of point binding positions detected at a\n    current sequencing depth
    meets saturation criteria, and if does not,\n    estimate what sequencing depth
    would be required to do so.\n"
