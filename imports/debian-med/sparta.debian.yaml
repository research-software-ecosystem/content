  description: automated reference-based bacterial RNA-seq Transcriptome 
    Analysis
  long_description: " SPARTA is a workflow aimed at analyzing single-end Illumina
    RNA-seq\n data. The workflow combines several tools: Trimmomatic (read\n trimming/adapter
    removal), FastQC (read quality analysis), Bowtie\n (mapping reads to the reference
    genome), HTSeq (transcript/gene feature\n abundance counting), and edgeR (differential
    gene expression analysis).\n Within the differential gene expression analysis
    step, batch effects can\n be detected and the user is warned of the potential,
    unintended\n additional variable. The analysis procedure is outlined below."
