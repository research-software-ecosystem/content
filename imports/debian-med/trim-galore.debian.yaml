  description: automate quality and adapter trimming for DNA sequencing
  long_description: " Trim Galore! is a wrapper script to automate quality and adapter
    trimming\n as well as quality control, with some added functionality to remove\n
    biased methylation positions for RRBS sequence files (for directional,\n non-directional
    (or paired-end) sequencing). It's main features are:\n  * For adapter trimming,
    Trim Galore! uses the first 13 bp of Illumina\n    standard adapters ('AGATCGGAAGAGC')
    by default (suitable for both ends\n    of paired-end libraries), but accepts
    other adapter sequence, too\n  * For MspI-digested RRBS libraries, Trim Galore!
    performs quality and\n    adapter trimming in two subsequent steps. This allows
    it to remove\n    2 additional bases that contain a cytosine which was artificially\n\
    \    introduced in the end-repair step during the library preparation\n  * For
    any kind of FastQ file other than MspI-digested RRBS, Trim\n    Galore! can perform
    single-pass adapter- and quality trimming\n  * The Phred quality of basecalls
    and the stringency for adapter removal\n    can be specified individually\n  *
    Trim Galore! can remove sequences if they become too short during\n    the trimming
    process. For paired-end files Trim Galore! removes entire\n    sequence pairs
    if one (or both) of the two reads became shorter than\n    the set length cutoff.
    Reads of a read-pair that are longer than a\n    given threshold but for which
    the partner read has become too short\n    can optionally be written out to single-end
    files. This ensures that\n    the information of a read pair is not lost entirely
    if only one read\n    is of good quality\n  * Trim Galore! can trim paired-end
    files by 1 additional bp from the 3'\n    end of all reads to avoid problems with
    invalid alignments with Bowtie 1\n  * Trim Galore! accepts and produces standard
    or gzip compressed FastQ files\n  * FastQC can optionally be run on the resulting
    output files once\n    trimming has completed\n"

  description: Automatiser kvalitet og adaptertilpasning for DNA-sekventering
  long_description: " Trim Galore! er et omslagsskript til at automatisere kvalitet
    og\n adaptertilpasning samt kvalitetskontrol, med lidt yderligere\n funktionalitet
    til at fjerne bias i methylationpositioner for rBBS-\n sekvensfiler (for rettet
    og ikke rettet (eller paired-end) sekventering).\n"
