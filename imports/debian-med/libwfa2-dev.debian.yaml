  description: exact gap-affine algorithm (development)
  long_description: " The wavefront alignment (WFA) algorithm is an exact gap-affine
    algorithm\n that takes advantage of homologous regions between the sequences to\n\
    \ accelerate the alignment process. Unlike to traditional dynamic\n programming
    algorithms that run in quadratic time, the WFA runs in time\n O(ns+s^2), proportional
    to the sequence length n and the alignment score\n s, using O(s^2) memory (or
    O(s) using the ultralow/BiWFA mode).\n Moreover, the WFA algorithm exhibits simple
    computational patterns that\n the modern compilers can automatically vectorize
    for different\n architectures without adapting the code. To intuitively illustrate
    why\n the WFA algorithm is so interesting, look at the following figure. The\n\
    \ left panel shows the cells computed by a classical dynamic programming\n based
    algorithm (like Smith-Waterman or Needleman Wunsch). In contrast,\n the right
    panel shows the cells computed by the WFA algorithm to obtain\n the same result
    (i.e., the optimal alignment).\n .\n This package contains the static library
    and the header files.\n"
