  description: QIIME2 plugin for core diversity analysis
  long_description: " QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome
    analysis\n package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables\n\
    \ researchers to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with\n\
    \ publication-quality figures and statistical results.  QIIME 2\n currently supports
    an initial end-to-end microbiome analysis pipeline.\n Functionality is made available
    through QIIME 2 plugins.\n .\n This plugin provides the means to statistically
    assess the diversity\n of microbiota. This has direct clinical interest, since
    with whatever\n we eat or have antibiotics applied, the survival of different
    groups\n of bacteria/yeasts will be affected. From these relative abundances of\n\
    \ strains that constribute the microbiome, most prominently, comparisons\n within
    a group of samples (or an individual) determines the alpha\n diversity and between
    (groups of) samples the beta diversity is\n inspected.\n .\n This package is key
    to most workflows in qiime."
