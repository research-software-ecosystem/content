  description: Implementations of SIMD instructions for all systems
  long_description: " SIMDe provides fast, portable implementations of SIMD intrinsics
    on hardware\n which doesn't natively support them, such as calling SSE functions
    on ARM.\n There is no performance penalty if the hardware supports the native\n\
    \ implementation (e.g., SSE/AVX runs at full speed on x86, NEON on ARM, etc.).\n\
    \ .\n This makes porting code to other architectures much easier in a few key
    ways:\n .\n First, instead of forcing you to rewrite everything for each architecture,\n\
    \ SIMDe lets you get a port up and running almost effortlessly. You can then\n\
    \ start working on switching the most performance-critical sections to native\n\
    \ intrinsics, improving performance gradually. SIMDe lets (for example) SSE/AVX\n\
    \ and NEON code exist side-by-side, in the same implementation.\n .\n Second,
    SIMDe makes it easier to write code targeting ISA extensions you don't\n have
    convenient access to. You can run NEON code on your x86 machine without an\n emulator.
    Obviously you'll eventually want to test on the actual hardware\n you're targeting,
    but for most development, SIMDe can provide a much easier\n path.\n .\n SIMDe
    takes a very different approach from most other SIMD abstraction layers\n in that
    it aims to expose the entire functionality of the underlying\n instruction set.
    Instead of limiting functionality to the lowest common\n denominator, SIMDe tries
    to minimize the amount of effort required to port\n while still allowing you the
    space to optimize as needed.\n .\n The current focus is on writing complete portable
    implementations, though a\n large number of functions already have accelerated
    implementations using one\n (or more) of the following:\n .\n     SIMD intrinsics
    from other ISA extensions (e.g., using NEON to implement\n SSE).\n     Compiler-specific
    vector extensions and built-ins such as\n __builtin_shufflevector and __builtin_convertvector\n\
    \     Compiler auto-vectorization hints, using:\n        OpenMP 4 SIMD\n     \
    \   Cilk Plus\n        GCC loop-specific pragmas\n        clang pragma loop hint
    directives\n"
