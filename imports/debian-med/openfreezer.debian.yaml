  long_description: " OpenFreezer Laboratory Reagent Tracking and Workflow Management
    System is an\n open-source information management system for biological laboratories.
    The\n system tracks information on all reagents within the laboratory, including\n\
    \ specific properties of each reagent (i.e. sequences, external identifiers),
    and\n on all the physical preparations of these reagents (storage locations, physical\n\
    \ characteristics). Complementing this repository are workflow tools, such as\n\
    \ primer design and automated feature mapping, making OpenFreezer a valuable tool\n\
    \ for the bench scientist."
