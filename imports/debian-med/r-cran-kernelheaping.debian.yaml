  description: GNU R kernel density estimation for heaped and rounded data
  long_description: " In self-reported or anonymised data the user often encounters
    heaped\n data, i.e. data which are rounded (to a possibly different degree of\n
    coarseness). While this is mostly a minor problem in parametric density\n estimation
    the bias can be very large for non-parametric methods such as\n kernel density
    estimation. This package implements a partly Bayesian\n algorithm treating the
    true unknown values as additional parameters and\n estimates the rounding parameters
    to give a corrected kernel density\n estimate. It supports various standard bandwidth
    selection methods.\n Varying rounding probabilities (depending on the true value)
    and\n asymmetric rounding is estimable as well: Gross, M. and Rendtel, U.\n (2016)
    (<doi:10.1093/jssam/smw011>). Additionally, bivariate non-\n parametric density
    estimation for rounded data, Gross, M. et al. (2016)\n (<doi:10.1111/rssa.12179>),
    as well as data aggregated on areas is\n supported.\n"
