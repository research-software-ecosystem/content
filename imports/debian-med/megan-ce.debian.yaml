  description: interactive tool to explore and analyse microbiome sequencing data
  long_description: " MEGAN Community Edition is a shotgun sequencer to analyze microbiome
    samples.\n It is a rewrite and extension of the widely-used microbiome analysis
    tool\n MEGAN so as to facilitate the interactive analysis of the taxonomic and\n
    functional content of very large microbiome datasets. Other new features\n include
    a functional classifier called InterPro2GO, gene-centric read\n assembly, principal
    coordinate analysis of taxonomy and function, and support\n for metadata.  By
    integrating MEGAN CE with the high-throughput DNA-to-protein\n alignment tool
    DIAMOND a powerful and complete pipeline for the analysis of\n metagenome shotgun
    sequences can be provided.\n"
