  description: enterprise electronic medical record system framework
  long_description: " OpenMRS was built to enable creation of customized medical record
    system\n forms with no programming knowledge (although medical and systems\n analysis
    knowledge is required). It was built specifically to respond to\n those actively
    building and managing health systems in the developing\n world, where AIDS, tuberculosis,
    and malaria afflict the lives of\n millions. The system is based on a conceptual
    database structure which\n is not dependent on the actual types of medical information
    required to\n be collected or on particular data collection forms and so can be\n\
    \ customized for different uses.\n .\n The package is both just a library of API
    calls and a database and a\n default implementation of those API calls in the
    form of a web\n application.\n .\n OpenMRS is mature software. It is based upon
    a program which has been\n used effectively for over 30 years at Regenstrief Institute.
    It is\n currently implemented in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Pakistan, Uganda,\n\
    \ Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Malawi, Phillipines,Peru, Haiti, and other\n countries.\n\
    \ .\n Features include:\n  * Backed by a data model driven by a concept dictionary\n\
    \  * Includes tools for data export and reporting\n  * Versions exist for HIV/AIDS,
    Drug resistant TB, primary care\n    and oncology\n  * Supports open standards
    for medical data exchange including HL7,\n    LOINC and IXF\n  * Modular construction"
