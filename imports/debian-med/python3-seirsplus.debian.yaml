  description: Models of SEIRS epidemic dynamics with extensions
  long_description: " This package implements generalized SEIRS infectious disease\n\
    \ dynamics models with extensions that model the effect of factors\n including
    population structure, social distancing, testing, contact\n tracing, and quarantining
    detected cases.\n .\n Notably, this package includes stochastic implementations
    of these\n models on dynamic networks.\n"
