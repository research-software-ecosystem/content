  description: robust matching of small genomic variant datasets
  long_description: " Small variant calling is an important component of many analyses,
    and, in\n many instances, it is important to determine the set of variants which
    appear\n in multiple callsets. Variant matching is complicated by variants that
    have\n multiple equivalent representations. Normalization and decomposition\n
    algorithms have been proposed, but are not robust to different\n representation
    of complex variants. The VarMatch algorithm is robust to\n different representation
    of complex variants and is particularly effective\n in low complexity regions
    or those dense in variants. VarMatch also provides\n summary statistics, annotations,
    and visualizations that are useful for\n understanding callers' performance."
