  description: multiple alignment of biological sequences
  long_description: " GramAlign is a time-efficient progressive Multiple Sequence
    Alignment\n (MSA) algorithm. The novelty of GramAlign comes from the sequence\n\
    \ distance estimation step, whereby distances are determined by the\n natural
    grammar present in nucleotide and amino acid sequences."
