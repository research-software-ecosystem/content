  description: installs data from the Ensembl genome database
  long_description: " The Ensembl genome database is an established reference\n for
    genomic sequences and their automated annotation.\n To have this data local has
    advantages for bulk analyses,\n e.g. for the mapping of reads from RNA-seq against
    the\n latest golden path - or a previous one to compare analyses.\n .\n This package
    provides a reproducible way to insatll this\n data and thus simplify the automation
    of respective\n workflows.\n"
