  description: graphical front end for computational chemistry programs
  long_description: " Viewmol is able to graphically aid in the generation of molecular\n\
    \ structures for computations and to visualize their results.\n .\n At present
    Viewmol includes input filters for Discover, DMol3, Gamess,\n Gaussian 9x/03,
    Gulp, Mopac, PQS, Turbomole, and Vamp outputs as well as\n for PDB files. Structures
    can be saved as Accelrys' car-files, MDL files,\n and Turbomole coordinate files.
    Viewmol can generate input files for\n Gaussian 9x/03. Viewmol's file format has
    been added to OpenBabel so that\n OpenBabel can serve as an input as well as an
    output filter for\n coordinates."
