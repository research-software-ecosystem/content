  description: Comprehensive medical practice management
  long_description: " OpenEMR is a free medical practice management, electronic medical\n
    records, prescription writing, and medical billing application. These\n programs
    are also referred to as electronic health records.  It is a\n free open source
    replacement for medical applications such as Medical\n Manager, Health Pro, and
    Misys. It features support for EDI billing to\n clearing houses such as MedAvant
    and ZirMED using ANSI X12. Medical\n claim and accounts receivable are accomplished
    through SQL-Ledger, which\n has been customized. Calendar features include categories
    for\n appointment types, colors associated with appointment types, repeating\n
    appointments, and the ability to restrict appointments based on type.\n There
    are customizable medical encounter forms, support for voice\n recognition software,
    and electronic or scanned digital document\n management for records.\n .\n The
    community is dedicated to guarding OpenEMR's status as a free, open\n source software
    solution for medical practices. Its members are\n comprised of software developers,
    as well as physicians and those with\n extensive medical and billing knowledge,
    all with the common goal of\n making OpenEMR a viable alternative to its proprietary
    counterparts.\n .\n The OpenEMR community strives to work together to create a
    high-quality\n electronic medical record and practice management system. Through
    open\n collaboration, the community is molding a stable, yet continuously\n improving
    product, thanks to the efforts of developers across the globe,\n brought together
    by their tenacity and the connectivity of the Internet."
