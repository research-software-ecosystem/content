  description: fast approximate nearest neighbor search
  long_description: " Header-only C++ HNSW implementation with Python bindings.\n\
    \ .\n A common task in data analysis but also in scientific computations\n is
    to find data that is very close (multi-dimensional space) or\n similar (same thing)
    to a given data point. Also as heuristics for\n physics engines, it is the objects
    closest to you that you are\n most likely to collide with. This library knows
    how to do this\n fast.\n"
