  description: sequence alignment and analysis tool to process sequencing data
  long_description: " MALT, an acronym for MEGAN alignment tool, is a sequence alignment
    and\n analysis tool designed for processing high-throughput sequencing data,\n
    especially in the context of metagenomics. It is an extension of MEGAN6,\n the
    MEGenome Analyzer and is designed to provide the input for MEGAN6,\n but can also
    be used independently of MEGAN6.\n .\n The core of the program is a sequence alignment
    engine that aligns DNA\n or protein sequences to a DNA or protein reference database
    in either\n BLASTN (DNA queries and DNA references), BLASTX (DNA queries and protein\n
    references) or BLASTP (protein queries and protein references) mode. The\n engine
    uses a banded-alignment algorithm with ane gap scores and BLOSUM\n substitution
    matrices (in the case of protein alignments). The program\n can compute both local
    alignments (Smith-Waterman) or semi-global\n alignments (in which reads are aligned
    end-to-end into reference\n sequences), the latter being more appropriate for
    aligning metagenomic\n reads to references.\n"
