  description: Genotyping from short reads using cloud computing
  long_description: " Crossbow is a scalable software pipeline for whole genome resequencing\n
    analysis. It combines Bowtie, an ultrafast and memory efficient short read\n aligner,
    and SoapSNP, an accurate genotyper, within Hadoop to distribute and\n accelerate
    the computation with many nodes. The pipeline can accurately analyze\n over 35x
    coverage of a human genome in one day on a 10-node local cluster, or\n in 3 hours
    for about $100 using a 40-node, 320-core cluster rented from\n Amazon's EC2 utility
    computing service."
