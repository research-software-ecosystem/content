  description: QTL analysis for expression data
  long_description: " QTL Reaper is software, written in C and compiled as a Python
    module, for\n rapidly scanning microarray expression data for QTLs. It is essentially\n\
    \ the batch-oriented version of WebQTL. It requires, as input, expression\n data
    from members of a set of recombinant inbred lines and genotype\n information for
    the same lines. It searches for an association between\n each expression trait
    and all genotypes and evaluates that association\n by a permutation test. For
    the permutation test, it performs only as\n many permutations as are necessary
    to define the empirical P-value to a\n reasonable precision. It also performs
    bootstrap resampling to estimate\n the confidence region for the location of a
    putative QTL.\n .\n The reaper module is used underneath the http://genenetwork.org
    site."
