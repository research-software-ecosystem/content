  description: quantitative analysis and visualization of medical images
  long_description: " The MIPAV (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization)\n
    application enables quantitative analysis and visualization of\n medical images
    of numerous modalities such as PET, MRI, CT, or\n microscopy.  Using MIPAV's standard
    user-interface and analysis\n tools, researchers at remote sites can easily share
    research data and\n analyses, thereby enhancing their ability to research, diagnose,\n
    monitor, and treat medical disorders.  MIPAV provides an interface\n for plug-ins
    and serves as the foundation for other projects\n (e.g. JIST).\n .\n This package
    provides downloader/installer for non-redistributable\n closed-source version
    of MIPAV and a convenience startup wrapper.\n You will have a choice of reviewing
    the license and accepting or\n declining it upon installation."
