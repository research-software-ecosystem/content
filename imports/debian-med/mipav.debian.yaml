  description: quantitative analysis and visualization of medical images
  long_description: " The MIPAV (Medical Image Processing, Analysis, and Visualization)\n\
    \ application enables quantitative analysis and visualization of\n medical images
    of numerous modalities such as PET, MRI, CT, or\n microscopy.  Using MIPAV's standard
    user-interface and analysis\n tools, researchers at remote sites can easily share
    research data and\n analyses, thereby enhancing their ability to research, diagnose,\n\
    \ monitor, and treat medical disorders.  MIPAV provides an interface\n for plug-ins
    and serves as the foundation for other projects\n (e.g. JIST).\n .\n This package
    provides downloader/installer for non-redistributable\n closed-source version
    of MIPAV and a convenience startup wrapper.\n You will have a choice of reviewing
    the license and accepting or\n declining it upon installation."
