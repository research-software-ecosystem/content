  description: automated structural variation detection for long-read sequencing
  long_description: " NextSV is an computational pipeline that allows structural variant
    (SV)\n calling from PacBio sequencing data using PBhoney and Sniffles. NextSV
    takes\n FASTA or FASTQ files as input. Once the SV caller is selected by user,
    NextSV\n automatically chooses the compatible aligner and performs mapping. The\n
    alignments will be automatically sorted and then presented to the SV caller.\n
    Users can change the parameters by modifying its configuration file. When the\n
    analysis is finished, NextSV will examine the FASTA/FASTQ, BAM, and result\n files
    and generate a report showing various statistics. If more than both\n callers
    are selected, NextSV will format the raw result files (.tails, .spots,\n or .vcf
    files) into bed files and generate the intersection or union call set\n for the
    purpose of higher accuracy or sensitivity."
