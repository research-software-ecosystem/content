  description: Picking Unique Relevant Peptides for viraL Experiments
  long_description: " Emerging virus diseases present a global threat to public health.
    To\n detect viral pathogens in time-critical scenarios, accurate and fast\n diagnostic
    assays are required. Such assays can now be established using\n mass spectrometry-based
    targeted proteomics, by which viral proteins can\n be rapidly detected from complex
    samples down to the strain level with\n high sensitivity and reproducibility.
    Developing such targeted assays\n involves tedious steps of peptide candidate
    selection, peptide\n synthesis, and assay optimization. Peptide selection requires
    extensive\n preprocessing by comparing candidate peptides against a large search\n
    space of background proteins. Purple (Picking Unique Relevant Peptides\n for viraL
    Experiments) is a software tool for selecting target-specific\n peptide candidates
    directly from given proteome sequence data.\n .\n Purple enables peptide candidate
    selection across various taxonomic\n levels and filtering against backgrounds
    of varying complexity. Its\n functionality is demonstrated using data from different
    virus species\n and strains. Purple enables building taxon-specific targeted assays\n
    and paves the way to time-efficient and robust viral diagnostics using\n targeted
    proteomics.\n .\n This is the command line version of purple."
