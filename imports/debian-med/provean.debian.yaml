  description: Protein Variation Effect Analyzer
  long_description: " PROVEAN (Protein Variation Effect Analyzer) is a software tool
    which predicts\n whether an amino acid substitution or indel has an impact on
    the biological\n function of a protein.\n .\n PROVEAN is useful for filtering
    sequence variants to identify nonsynonymous or\n indel variants that are predicted
    to be functionally important.\n .\n The performance of PROVEAN is comparable to
    popular tools such as SIFT or\n PolyPhen-2.\n .\n A fast computation approach
    to obtain pairwise sequence alignment scores\n enabled the generation of precomputed
    PROVEAN predictions for 20 single AA\n substitutions and a single AA deletion
    at every amino acid position of all\n protein sequences in human and mouse.\n"
