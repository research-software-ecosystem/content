  description: generate consensus sequences for PacBio data -- Python 3
  long_description: " ConsensusCore2 embodies core C++ routines underlying the Arrow
    HMM\n algorithm for PacBio multi-sequence consensus.  Arrow is the successor\n\
    \ to the Quiver model---a CRF model that was embodied in the\n ConsensusCore C++
    library. Compared to Quiver, the Arrow model is more\n statistically principled
    and easier and more robust to train.\n .\n This package installs the library for
    Python 3."
