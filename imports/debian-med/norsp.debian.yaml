  description: predictor of non-regular secondary structure
  long_description: " NORSp is a publicly available predictor for disordered regions
    in proteins.\n Specifically, it predicts long regions with no regular secondary
    structure.\n Upon submission of a protein sequence, NORSp analyses the protein
    about its\n secondary structure, the presence of transmembrane helices and coiled-coils.\n
    It then returns the presence and position of disordered regions.\n .\n NORSp can
    be useful for biologists in several ways. For example,\n crystallographers can
    check whether their proteins contain NORS regions and\n make the decision about
    whether to proceed with the experiments since NORS\n proteins may be difficult
    to crystallise, as demonstrated by the their low\n occurrence in PDB. Biologists
    interested in protein structure-function\n relationship may also find it interesting
    to verify whether the\n protein-protein interaction sites coincide with NORS regions.\n"
