  description: pipeline with virus identification with Nanopore sequencer
  long_description: " This is the ARTIC bioinformatics pipeline for working with virus
    sequencing\n data, sequenced with nanopore. It implements a complete bioinformatics\n\
    \ protocol to take the output from the Nanopore sequencer and determine consensus\n\
    \ genome sequences. Includes basecalling, de-multiplexing, mapping, polishing\n\
    \ and consensus generation.\n .\n An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, Ebola, ... something
    unknown? This\n software is field-proven."
