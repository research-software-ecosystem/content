  description: biological data-bank updater (Python 3)
  long_description: " BioMAJ downloads remote data banks, checks their status and
    applies\n transformation workflows, with consistent state, to provide ready-to-use\n\
    \ data for biologists and bioinformaticians. For example, it can transform\n original
    FASTA files into BLAST indexes. It is very flexible and its post-\n processing
    facilities can be extended very easily.\n .\n BioMAJ is a rewrite of BioMAJ, using
    Mongodb as backend. See wiki for\n migration.\n .\n This package contains the
    Python 3 module."
