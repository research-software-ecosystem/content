  description: genomic structural variation discovery
  long_description: " PBHoney is an implementation of two variant-identification\n\
    \ approaches designed to exploit the high mappability of long reads\n (i.e., greater
    than 10,000 bp). PBHoney considers both intra-read\n discordance and soft-clipped
    tails of long reads to identify\n structural variants.\n .\n PBHoney is part of
    the PBSuite.\n"
