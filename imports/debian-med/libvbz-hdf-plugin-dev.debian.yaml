  description: VBZ compression plugin for nanopore signal data (devel)
  long_description: " VBZ Compression uses variable byte integer encoding to compress
    nanopore\n signal data.\n .\n The performance of VBZ is achieved by taking advantage
    of the properties\n of the raw signal and therefore is most effective when applied
    to the\n signal dataset. Other datasets you may have in your Fast5 files will
    not\n be able to take advantage of the default VBZ settings for compression.\n
    VBZ will be used as the default compression scheme in a future release\n of MinKNOW.\n
    .\n This package contains the header files.\n"
