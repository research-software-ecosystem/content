  description: fast and accurate multiple sequence alignment based on profile consistency
  long_description: " PCMA (profile consistency multiple sequence alignment) is a
    progressive\n multiple sequence alignment program that combines two different\n\
    \ alignment strategies. Highly similar sequences are aligned in a fast way\n as
    in ClustalW, forming pre-aligned groups. The T-Coffee strategy is\n applied to
    align the relatively divergent groups based on\n profile–profile comparison and
    consistency. The scoring function for\n local alignments of pre-aligned groups
    is based on a novel\n profile–profile comparison method that is a generalization
    of the\n PSI-BLAST approach to profile–sequence comparison. PCMA balances speed\n\
    \ and accuracy in a flexible way and is suitable for aligning large\n numbers
    of sequences."
