  description: deconvolution for Illumina amplicon sequencing
  long_description: " Deblur is a greedy deconvolution algorithm for amplicon sequencing\n
    based on Illumina Miseq/Hiseq error profiles.  The authors recommend\n using Deblur
    via the QIIME2 plugin q2-deblur. Examples of its use can be\n found within the
    plugin itself. However, Deblur itself does not depend\n on QIIME2.\n .\n The input
    to Deblur workflow is a directory of FASTA or FASTQ files\n (1 per sample) or
    a single demultiplexed FASTA or FASTQ file. These\n files can be gzip'd. The output
    directory will contain three BIOM\n tables in which the observation IDs are the
    Deblurred sequences. The\n outputs are contingent on the reference databases used
    and a more\n focused discussion on them is in the subsequent README section titled\n
    \"Positive and Negative Filtering.\" The output files are as follows:\n .\n  *
    reference-hit.biom : contains only Deblurred reads matching the\n    positive
    filtering database. By default, a reference composed of 16S\n    sequences is
    used, and this resulting table will contain only those\n    reads which recruit
    at a coarse level to it will be retained. Reads\n    are also filtered against
    the negative reference, which by default\n    will remove any read which appears
    to be PhiX or adapter.\n .\n  * reference-hit.seqs.fa : a fasta file containing
    all the sequences\n    in reference-hit.biom\n .\n  * reference-non-hit.biom :
    contains only Deblurred reads that did not\n    align to the positive filtering
    database. Negative filtering is also\n    appied to this table, so by default,
    PhiX and adapter are removed.\n .\n  * reference-non-hit.seqs.fa : a fasta file
    containing all the\n    sequences in reference-non-hit.biom\n .\n  * all.biom
    : contains all Deblurred reads. This file represents the\n    union of the \"\
    reference-hit.biom\" and \"reference-non-hit.biom\" tables.\n .\n    * all.seqs.fa
    : a fasta file containing all the sequences in all.biom\n .\n Deblur uses two
    types of filtering on the sequences:\n .\n  * Negative mode - removes known artifact
    sequences (i.e. sequences\n    aligning to PhiX or Adapter with >=95% identity
    and coverage).\n .\n  * Positive mode - keeps only sequences similar to a reference
    database\n    (by default known 16S sequences). SortMeRNA is used, and any sequence\n\
    \    with an e-value <= 10 is retained. Deblur also outputs a BIOM table\n   \
    \ without this positive filtering step (named all.biom).\n .\n The FASTA files
    for both of these filtering steps can be supplied via\n the --neg-ref-fp and --pos-ref-fp
    options. By default, the negative\n database is composed of PhiX and adapter sequence
    and the positive\n database of known 16S sequences.\n .\n Deblur uses negative
    mode filtering to remove known artifact (i.e. PhiX\n and Adapter sequences) prior
    to denoising. The output of Deblur contains\n three files: all.biom, which includes
    all sOTUs, reference-hit.biom,\n which contains the output of positive filtering
    of the sOTUs (default\n only sOTUs similar to 16S sequences), and reference-non-hit.biom,\n
    which contains only sOTUs failing the positive filtering (default only\n non-16S
    sOTUs).\n"

  description: Dekonvolution for illumina amplicon sequencing
  long_description: " Deblur er en grådig dekonvolutionsalgoritme for amplicon sequencing
    baseret på Illumina Miseq/Hiseq-fejlprofiler. Forfatterne anbefaler at bruge Deblur
    via QIIME2-udvidelsesmodulet q2-deblur. Eksempler på brug kan findes i selve udvidelsesmodulet.
    Selve Deblur afhænger dog ikke af QIIME2.\n"
