  description: binning/clustering newick trees by topology
  long_description: " PhyBin is a simple command line tool that classifies a set of
    Newick\n tree files by their topology. The purpose of it is to take a large set\n
    of tree files and browse through the most common tree topologies.\n .\n It can
    do simple binning of identical trees or more complex clustering\n based on an
    all-to-all Robinson-Foulds distance matrix.\n .\n phybin produces output files
    that characterize the size and contents of\n each bin or cluster (including generating
    GraphViz-based visual\n representations of the tree topologies).\n"
