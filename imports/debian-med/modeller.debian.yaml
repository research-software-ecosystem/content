  description: Protein structure modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints
  long_description: " MODELLER is used for homology or comparative modeling of protein\n\
    \ three-dimensional structures (1). The user provides an alignment of a\n sequence
    to be modeled with known related structures and MODELLER automatically\n calculates
    a model containing all non-hydrogen atoms. MODELLER implements\n comparative protein
    structure modeling by satisfaction of spatial restraints\n (2, 3), and can perform
    many additional tasks, including de novo modeling of\n loops in protein structures,
    optimization of various models of protein\n structure with respect to a flexibly
    defined objective function, multiple\n alignment of protein sequences and/or structures,
    clustering, searching of\n sequence databases, comparison of protein structures,
    etc."
