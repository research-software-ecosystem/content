  description: phylogenetic analysis with space/time models
  long_description: " PHAST is a software package for comparative and evolutionary
    genomics.\n It consists of about half a dozen major programs, plus more than a
    dozen\n utilities for manipulating sequence alignments, phylogenetic trees, and\n
    genomic annotations. For the most part, PHAST focuses on two kinds of\n applications:
    the identification of novel functional elements, including\n protein-coding exons
    and evolutionarily conserved sequences; and\n statistical phylogenetic modeling,
    including estimation of model\n parameters, detection of signatures of selection,
    and reconstruction of\n ancestral sequences.\n .\n PHAST does not support phylogeny
    reconstruction or sequence alignment,\n and it is designed for use with DNA sequences
    only (see Comparison).\n"
