  description: gapped protein motifs from unaligned sequences
  long_description: " GLAM2 is a software package for finding motifs in sequences,
    typically\n amino-acid or nucleotide sequences. A motif is a re-occurring sequence\n\
    \ pattern: typical examples are the TATA box and the CAAX prenylation motif. The\n\
    \ main innovation of GLAM2 is that it allows insertions and deletions in motifs.\n\
    \ .\n This package includes programs for discovering motifs shared by a set of\n\
    \ sequences and finding matches to these motifs in a sequence database, as well\n\
    \ as utilities for converting glam2 motifs to standard alignment formats,\n masking
    glam2 motifs out of sequences so that weaker motifs can be found, and\n removing
    highly similar members of a set of sequences.\n .\n In this binary package, the
    fast Fourier algorithm (FFT) was enabled for the\n glam2 program."
