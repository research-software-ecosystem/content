  description: tool to identify unstructured loops in proteins
  long_description: " NORSnet can distinguish between very long contiguous segments
    with\n non-regular secondary structure (NORS regions) and well-folded proteins.\n
    .\n NORSnet was trained on predicted information rather than on experimental data.\n
    This allows NORSnet to reach into regions in sequence space that are not\n covered
    by specialized disorder predictors.  One disadvantage of this approach\n is that
    it is not optimal for the identification of the \"average\" disordered\n region.\n
    .\n NORSnet takes the following input, further described on norsnet(1):\n  * a
    protein sequence in a FASTA file\n  * secondary structure and solvent accessibility
    prediction by prof(1)\n  * an HSSP file\n  * flexible/rigid residues prediction
    by profbval(1)\n"
