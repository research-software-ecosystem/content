  description: Analyzing, processing and visualizing of multi dimensional 
    microscopy images
  long_description: " BioImageXD is a multi-purpose post-processing tool for bioimaging.
    The\n software can be used for simple visualization of multi-channel temporal
    image\n stacks to complex 3D rendering of multiple channels at once. Animations
    of 3D\n renderings can be created using flying paths or keyframes. BioImageXD
    has basic\n image adjustment operations and a collection of noise reduction methods.\n\
    \ Processing methods are accompanied with a selection of segmentation methods.\n\
    \ Segmentation results can be analysed for tens of parameters or used for motion\n\
    \ tracking. Other quantitative analysis methods include for instance voxel and\n\
    \ object colocalization methods and internalization analysis. All processing and\n\
    \ analysis methods can be build into pipelines and run for hundreds of datasets\n\
    \ at once in batch processor."
