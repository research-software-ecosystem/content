  description: Basecaller for Oxford Nanopore Sequencing Data
  long_description: " The highly portable Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencer has enabled
    new\n applications of genome sequencing directly in the field. However, the\n\
    \ MinION currently relies on a cloud computing platform, Metrichor\n (metrichor.com),
    for translating locally generated sequencing data into\n basecalls.\n .\n Nanocall
    allows offline and private analysis of MinION data. Nanocall is\n the first freely-available,
    open-source basecaller for Oxford Nanopore\n sequencing data and does not require
    an internet connection. Using R7.3\n chemistry, on two E.coli and two human samples,
    with natural as well as\n PCR-amplified DNA, Nanocall reads have ~68% identity,
    directly\n comparable to Metrichor \"1D\" data. Further, Nanocall is efficient,\n\
    \ processing ~2500Kbp of sequence per core hour using the fastest\n settings,
    and fully parallelized. Using a 4 core desktop computer,\n Nanocall could basecall
    a MinION sequencing run in real time. Metrichor\n provides the ability to integrate
    the \"1D\" sequencing of template and\n complement strands of a single DNA molecule,
    and create a \"2D\" read.\n Nanocall does not currently integrate this technology,
    and addition of\n this capability will be an important future development. In
    summary,\n Nanocall is the first open-source, freely available, off-line basecaller\n\
    \ for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data."
