  description: refined binning of metagenomic contigs using assembly graphs
  long_description: " GraphBin is a NGS data-based metagenomic contig bin refinment
    tool that\n makes use of the contig connectivity information from the assembly
    graph\n to bin contigs. It utilizes the binning result of an existing binning\n\
    \ tool and a label propagation algorithm to correct mis-binned contigs and\n predict
    the labels of contigs which are discarded due to short length."
