  description: FAST Analysis of Sequences Toolbox
  long_description: " The FAST Analysis of Sequences Toolbox (FAST) is a set of Unix
    tools (for\n example fasgrep, fascut, fashead and fastr) for sequence bioinformatics\n\
    \ modeled after the Unix textutils (such as grep, cut, head, tr, etc). FAST\n\
    \ workflows are designed for \"inline\" (serial) processing of flatfile\n biological
    sequence record databases per-sequence, rather than per-line,\n through Unix command
    pipelines. The default data exchange format is\n multifasta (specifically, a restriction
    of BioPerl FastA format). FAST\n tools expose the power of Perl and BioPerl for
    sequence analysis to\n non-programmers in an easy-to-learn command-line paradigm.\n\
    \ .\n You do not need to know Perl or BioPerl to use FAST."
