  description: FAST Analysis of Sequences Toolbox
  long_description: " The FAST Analysis of Sequences Toolbox (FAST) is a set of Unix
    tools (for\n example fasgrep, fascut, fashead and fastr) for sequence bioinformatics\n
    modeled after the Unix textutils (such as grep, cut, head, tr, etc). FAST\n workflows
    are designed for \"inline\" (serial) processing of flatfile\n biological sequence
    record databases per-sequence, rather than per-line,\n through Unix command pipelines.
    The default data exchange format is\n multifasta (specifically, a restriction
    of BioPerl FastA format). FAST\n tools expose the power of Perl and BioPerl for
    sequence analysis to\n non-programmers in an easy-to-learn command-line paradigm.\n
    .\n You do not need to know Perl or BioPerl to use FAST."
