  description: annotating protein coding genes in genomes.
  long_description: " Genomic DNA controls the behaviour of biological cells. Understanding
    it, \n and its variations, facilitates the molecular pathology of diseases. \n\
    \ braker.pl can either run with a genome sequence, only; or with additional \n\
    \ alignments for short transcriptome reads against the genome; or with \n additional
    protein sequences of closely related species; or with evidence \n from the alignment
    of protein sequences of distantly related species.\n The package provides the
    means to interpret genomic sequences in FASTA format\n from fungi, plants and
    animals."
