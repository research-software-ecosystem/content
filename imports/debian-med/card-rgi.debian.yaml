  description: analysis of genome sequences using the Resistance Gene Identifier
  long_description: " The Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (\"CARD\")
    provides data,\n models, and algorithms relating to the molecular basis of antimicrobial\n
    resistance. The CARD provides curated reference sequences and SNPs\n organized
    via the Antibiotic Resistance Ontology (\"ARO\"). These data can\n be browsed
    on the website or downloaded in a number of formats. These\n data are additionally
    associated with detection models, in the form of\n curated homology cut-offs and
    SNP maps, for prediction of resistome from\n molecular sequences. These models
    can be downloaded or can be used for\n analysis of genome sequences using the
    Resistance Gene Identifier\n (\"RGI\"), either online or as a stand-alone tool."
