  description: packaging tool for Java applications with Maven coordinates
  long_description: " A capsule is a single executable JAR that contains everything
    an application\n needs to run either in the form of embedded files or as declarative
    metadata.\n Maven Capsule is a capsule that allows the creations of capsules that,
    instead\n of embedding their dependencies, download all or some of them from a
    Maven\n repository. The dependencies are downloaded, cached locally, and shared
    among\n other capsules that also depend on them. In addition, this capsule allows\n
    specifying capsule metadata in a POM file in addition to the manifest.\n .\n A
    capsule with the Maven caplet that has all (or almost all) of its\n dependencies
    downloaded rather than embedded is known as a \"thin\" capsule (as\n opposed to
    a \"fat\" capsule, which embeds all of its dependencies). In fact, a\n capsule
    may not contain any of the application's classes/JARs at all. Instead,\n the capsule's
    manifest may contain these attributes alone (and no files in the\n capsule JAR
    besides the manifest). When the capsule is launched, the newest\n available version
    of the application will be downloaded, cached and launched.\n .\n This package
    contains a fork of the original capsule-maven project. This fork\n is suited as
    a dependency of nextflow.\n"
