  description: BLAST-Like Alignment Tool
  long_description: " BLAT on DNA is designed to quickly find sequences of 95% and
    greater\n similarity of length 25 bases or more. It may miss more divergent or
    shorter\n sequence alignments. It will find perfect sequence matches of 25 bases,
    and\n sometimes find them down to 20 bases. BLAT on proteins finds sequences of
    80%\n and greater similarity of length 20 amino acids or more. In practice DNA
    BLAT\n works well on primates, and protein blat on land vertebrates.\n .\n BLAT
    is not BLAST. DNA BLAT works by keeping an index of the entire genome in\n memory.
    The index consists of all non-overlapping 11-mers except for those\n heavily involved
    in repeats. The index takes up a bit less than a gigabyte of\n RAM. The genome
    itself is not kept in memory, allowing BLAT to deliver high\n performance on a
    reasonably priced Linux box. The index is used to find areas\n of probable homology,
    which are then loaded into memory for a detailed\n alignment. Protein BLAT works
    in a similar manner, except with 4-mers rather\n than 11-mers. The protein index
    takes a little more than 2 gigabytes."
