  description: arranges water molecules around protein structures
  long_description: " For molecular dynamics simulations it is sometimes appropriate\n
    not to model in the vacuum but to have the proteins surrounded\n by their solvent.
    This program computes the location of water\n molecules such that the resulting
    PDB files become suitable\n for further analyses.\n"
