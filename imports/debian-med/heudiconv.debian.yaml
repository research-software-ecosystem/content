  description: DICOM converter with support for structure heuristics
  long_description: " This is a flexible dicom converter for organizing brain imaging
    data into\n structured directory layouts. It allows for flexible directory layouts
    and\n naming schemes through customizable heuristics implementations.\n It only
    converts the necessary dicoms, not everything in a directory.\n It tracks the
    provenance of the conversion from dicom to nifti in w3c\n prov format.\n"
