  description: Variant Effect Predictor predicting the functional effects of 
    genomic variants
  long_description: " The Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor predicts the functional
    effects of\n genomic variants. It has three components:\n .\n  * VEP (Variant
    Effect Predictor) predicts the functional effects of\n    genomic variants.\n\
    \  * Haplosaurus uses phased genotype data to predict whole-transcript\n    haplotype
    sequences.\n  * Variant Recoder translates between different variant encodings."
