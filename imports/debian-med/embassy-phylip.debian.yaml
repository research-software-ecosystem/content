  description: EMBOSS conversions of the programs in the phylip package
  long_description: " This package is the adaptation of the PHYLIP package in which
    its\n programs can operate with the biological sequence formats and databases\n\
    \ of the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite (EMBOSS). The\n software
    packages adapted for EMBOSS are called EMBASSY.\n .\n PHYLIP (the PHYLogeny Inference
    Package) is a package of programs for\n inferring phylogenies (evolutionary trees).
    Methods that are available\n in the package include parsimony, distance matrix,
    and likelihood\n methods, including bootstrapping and consensus trees. Data types
    that\n can be handled include molecular sequences, gene frequencies,\n restriction
    sites and fragments, distance matrices, and discrete\n characters.\n .\n The EMBASSY
    PHYLIP programs all have the prefix \"f\" to distinguish them\n from the original
    programs and avoid namespace conflict."
