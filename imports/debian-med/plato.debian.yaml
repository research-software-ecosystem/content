  description: Analysis, translation, and organization of large-scale genetic 
    data
  long_description: " PLATO is an acronym for \"PLatform for the Analysis, Translation,\n\
    \ and Organization of large-scale data\".  Recent technological advances\n enable
    the study of hundreds of thousands of human single-nucleotide\n polymorphisms
    at the population level. Because strategies for analyzing\n these data have not
    kept pace with the laboratory methods that generate\n the data, it is unlikely
    that these advances will immediately lead to\n an improved understanding of the
    genetic contribution to common human\n disease and drug response. Currently, no
    single analytical method\n allows us to extract all available information from
    a whole-genome\n association study. In fact, no single method can be optimal for
    all\n datasets, especially when the genetic architecture for diseases can\n vary
    substantially, as is certainly the case. Therefore, an integrative\n platform
    is needed to accommodate multiple analytical methods for\n analysis as we learn
    more about genetic architecture. As a result,\n we are developing a system for
    the analysis of genome-wide association\n data that will incorporate several analytical
    approaches as filters to\n allow a scientist to choose whatever analytical methods
    they wish to\n apply. PLATO (PLatform for the Analysis, Translation, and Organization\n\
    \ of large-scale data) will incorporate a number of filters to select\n the important
    SNPs in a genome-wide association study.\n .\n Whole-genome Association Study
    Pipeline (WASP) has recently been\n absorbed into PLATO. WASP was designed to
    aid in retrieving, evaluating,\n formatting, and analyzing genotypic and clinical
    data from the latest\n large-scale genotyping studies. WASP implements a battery
    of quality\n control procedures to assess the data. Among the currently available\n\
    \ procedures are the examination of marker and sample genotyping\n efficiency,
    allele frequency calculations, checks of Mendelian error\n (if applicable) and
    gender discrepancies (based on available chromosome X\n and Y genotypes), and
    tests of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Additionally,\n WASP can retrieve and format
    data for other software programs such as the\n Graphical Representation of Relationships
    (GRR) program, or STRUCTURE,\n and depending on the nature of the samples and
    the depth of examination\n the user desires to pursue. Beyond the quality control
    aspect of this\n application, WASP can perform standard tests of association using
    the\n Transmission Disequilibrium Test TDT for family-based datasets and the\n\
    \ chi-square test of association for case-control datasets."
