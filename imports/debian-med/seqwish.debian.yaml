  description: alignment to variation graph inducer
  long_description: " Seqwish implements a lossless conversion from pairwise alignments\n\
    \ between sequences to a variation graph encoding the sequences and their\n alignments.
    As input we typically take all-versus-all alignments, but\n the exact structure
    of the alignment set may be defined in an\n application specific way. This algorithm
    uses a series of disk-backed\n sorts and passes over the alignment and sequence
    inputs to allow the\n graph to be constructed from very large inputs that are
    commonly\n encountered when working with large numbers of noisy input sequences.\n\
    \ Memory usage during construction and traversal is limited by the use of\n sorted
    disk-backed arrays and succinct rank/select dictionaries to\n record a queryable
    version of the graph."
