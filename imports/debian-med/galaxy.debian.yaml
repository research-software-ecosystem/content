  description: scientific workflow and data integration platform for computational
    biology
  long_description: " Galaxy is a scientific workflow, data integration, and data
    and analysis\n persistence and publishing platform that aims to make computational\n\
    \ biology accessible to research scientists that do not have computer\n programming
    or systems administration experience. Although it was\n initially developed for
    genomics research, it is largely domain agnostic\n and is now used as a general
    bioinformatics workflow management system."
