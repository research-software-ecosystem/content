  description: Collection of tools to annotate genomes using long read transcriptomics
    data
  long_description: " The toolchain is composed of the following tools:\n 1. spliced_bam2gff
    - a tool for converting sorted BAM\n files containing spliced alignments\n into
    GFF2 format. Each read will be represented as a distinct\n transcript. This tool
    comes handy when visualizing spliced\n reads at particular loci and to provide
    input to the rest\n of the toolchain.\n .\n 2. cluster_gff - this tool takes a
    sorted GFF2 file as\n input and clusters together reads having similar\n exon/intron
    structure and creates a rough consensus\n of the clusters by taking the median
    of exon\n boundaries from all transcripts in the cluster.\n .\n 3. polish_clusters
    - this tool takes the cluster\n definitions generated by cluster_gff and for each\n
    cluster creates an error corrected read by mapping\n all reads on the read with
    the median length\n and polishing it using racon. The polished reads\n can be
    mapped to the genome using minimap2 or GMAP.\n .\n 4. collapse_partials - this
    tool takes GFFs generated\n by either cluster_gff or polish_clusters and filters\n
    out transcripts which are likely to be based on RNA\n degradation products from
    the 5' end. The tool clusters\n the input transcripts into \"loci\" by the 3'
    ends and\n discards transcripts which have a compatible transcripts\n in the loci
    with more exons.\n"
