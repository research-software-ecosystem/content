  description: sequence consensus using directed acyclic graphs
  long_description: " pbdagcon is a tool that implements DAGCon (Directed Acyclic
    Graph Consensus)\n which is a sequence consensus algorithm based on using directed
    acyclic\n graphs to encode multiple sequence alignment.\n .\n It uses the alignment
    information from blasr to align sequence reads to a\n \"backbone\" sequence. Based
    on the underlying alignment directed acyclic graph\n (DAG), it will be able to
    use the new information from the reads to find the\n discrepancies between the
    reads and the \"backbone\" sequences. A dynamic\n programming process is then
    applied to the DAG to find the optimum sequence\n of bases as the consensus. The
    new consensus can be used as a new backbone\n sequence to iteratively improve
    the consensus quality.\n .\n While the code is developed for processing PacBio(TM)
    raw sequence data,\n the algorithm can be used for general consensus purpose.
    Currently, it only\n takes FASTA input. For shorter read sequences, one might
    need to adjust the\n blasr alignment parameters to get the alignment string properly.\n\
    \ .\n The code and the underlying graphical data structure have been used for
    some\n algorithm development prototyping including phasing reads and pre-assembly.\n"
