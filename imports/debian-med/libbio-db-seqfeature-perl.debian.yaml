  description: Normalized feature for use with Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store
  long_description: " The Bio::DB::SeqFeature object is the default SeqFeature class
    stored in\n Bio::DB::SeqFeature databases. It implements both the\n Bio::DB::SeqFeature::NormalizedFeatureI
    and\n Bio::DB::SeqFeature::NormalizedTableFeatureI interfaces, which means that
    its\n subfeatures, if any, are stored in the database in a normalized fashion,
    and\n that the parent/child hierarchy of features and subfeatures are also stored\n
    in the database as set of tuples. This provides efficiencies in both storage\n
    and retrieval speed.\n .\n Typically you will not create Bio::DB::SeqFeature directly,
    but will ask the\n database to do so on your behalf, as described in Bio::DB::SeqFeature::Store.\n"
