  description: analysis of small RNA in NGS data
  long_description: " Identifies small RNA sequences of all sorts in RNA sequencing
    data. This is\n especially helpful for the identification of RNA that is neither
    coding nor\n belonging to the already well-established group of miRNA, towards
    many tools\n feel constrained to.\n .\n This package provides the Python module.
    For executables see the package\n 'seqcluster'.\n"
