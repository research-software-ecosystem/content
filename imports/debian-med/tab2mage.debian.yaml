  description: submitting large microarray experiment datasets to public 
    repository database
  long_description: " Tab2MAGE is a software package written and supported by the
    ArrayExpress\n curation team, which aims to ease the process of submitting large\n\
    \ microarray experiment datasets to our public repository database. To\n this
    end, Tab2MAGE currently includes two tools, the tab2mage.pl script\n itself, and
    a data file checking script, expt_check.pl. With these\n scripts it is possible
    to perform an initial data file validation\n against an array design (e.g., in
    the form of an \"Array Description\n File\" or ADF), and then to generate MAGE-ML
    using these data files\n alongside a separate spreadsheet providing MIAME-compliant
    sample\n annotation."
