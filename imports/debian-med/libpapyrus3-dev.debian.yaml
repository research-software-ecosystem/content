  description: DICOM compatible file format library
  long_description: " PAPYRUS 3.0 file format based on the new DICOM 3.0 Standard
    addresses the open\n interchange of medical images in files or on removable storage
    media. This\n specific implementation of the DICOM standard is intended as a generic
    solution\n for interchange of multi-modality medical images on removable media.
    It can\n also be used for convenient exchange of image data between different
    computer\n systems through industry standard file transfer mechanisms. Finally
    it can also\n be used for storage and archival of medical image data in a DICOM
    compatible\n format.\n .\n This package contains the libraries needed to run PAPYRUS
    3.0 applications.\n"
