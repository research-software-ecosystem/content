    "Description": "To obtain unbiased proteome coverage from a biological sample, mass-spectrometer is operated in Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mode. Alignment of these DIA runs establishes consistency and less missing values in complete data-matrix. This package implements dynamic programming with affine gap penalty based approach for pair-wise alignment of analytes. A hybrid approach of global alignment (through MS2 features) and local alignment (with MS2 chromatograms) is implemented in this tool.",
