    "Description": "Pathways, reactions, and biological entities in Reactome knowledge are systematically represented as an ordered network. Instances are represented as nodes and relationships between instances as edges; they are all stored in the Reactome Graph Database. This package serves as an interface to query the interconnected data from a local Neo4j database, with the aim of minimizing the usage of Neo4j Cypher queries.",
