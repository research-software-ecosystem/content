    "Description": "This package implements CBEA, a method to perform set-based analysis for microbiome relative abundance data. This approach constructs a competitive balance between taxa within the set and remainder taxa per sample. More details can be found in the Nguyen et al. 2021+ manuscript. Additionally, this package adds support functions to help users perform taxa-set enrichment analyses using existing gene set analysis methods. In the future we hope to also provide curated knowledge driven taxa sets.",
