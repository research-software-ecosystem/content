    "Description": "KnowYourCG (KYCG) is a supervised learning framework designed for the functional analysis of DNA methylation data. Unlike existing tools that focus on genes or genomic intervals, KnowYourCG directly targets CpG dinucleotides, featuring automated supervised screenings of diverse biological and technical influences, including sequence motifs, transcription factor binding, histone modifications, replication timing, cell-type-specific methylation, and trait-epigenome associations. KnowYourCG addresses the challenges of data sparsity in various methylation datasets, including low-pass Nanopore sequencing, single-cell DNA methylomes, 5-hydroxymethylation profiles, spatial DNA methylation maps, and array-based datasets for epigenome-wide association studies and epigenetic clocks.",
