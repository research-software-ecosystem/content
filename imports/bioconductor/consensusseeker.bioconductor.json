    "Description": "This package compares genomic positions and genomic ranges from multiple experiments to extract common regions. The size of the analyzed region is adjustable as well as the number of experiences in which a feature must be present in a potential region to tag this region as a consensus region. In genomic analysis where feature identification generates a position value surrounded by a genomic range, such as ChIP-Seq peaks and nucleosome positions, the replication of an experiment may result in slight differences between predicted values. This package enables the conciliation of the results into consensus regions.",
