    "Description": "methylscaper is an R package for processing and visualizing data jointly profiling methylation and chromatin accessibility (MAPit, NOMe-seq, scNMT-seq, nanoNOMe, etc.). The package supports both single-cell and single-molecule data, and a common interface for jointly visualizing both data types through the generation of ordered representational methylation-state matrices. The Shiny app allows for an interactive seriation process of refinement and re-weighting that optimally orders the cells or DNA molecules to discover methylation patterns and nucleosome positioning.",
