    "Description": "Feature selection aims to identify and remove redundant, irrelevant and noisy variables from high-dimensional datasets. Selecting informative features affects the subsequent classification and regression analyses by improving their overall performances. Several methods have been proposed to perform feature selection: most of them relies on univariate statistics, correlation, entropy measurements or the usage of backward/forward regressions. Herein, we propose an efficient, robust and fast method that adopts stochastic optimization approaches for high-dimensional. GARS is an innovative implementation of a genetic algorithm that selects robust features in high-dimensional and challenging datasets.",
