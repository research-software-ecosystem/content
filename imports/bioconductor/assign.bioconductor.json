    "Description": "ASSIGN is a computational tool to evaluate the pathway deregulation/activation status in individual patient samples. ASSIGN employs a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach that adapts predetermined pathway signatures derived either from knowledge-based literature or from perturbation experiments to the cell-/tissue-specific pathway signatures. The deregulation/activation level of each context-specific pathway is quantified to a score, which represents the extent to which a patient sample encompasses the pathway deregulation/activation signature.",
