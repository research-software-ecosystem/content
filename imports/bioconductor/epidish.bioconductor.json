    "Description": "EpiDISH is a R package to infer the proportions of a priori known cell-types present in a sample representing a mixture of such cell-types. Right now, the package can be used on DNAm data of whole blood, generic epithelial tissue and breast tissue. Besides, the package provides a function that allows the identification of differentially methylated cell-types and their directionality of change in Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.",
