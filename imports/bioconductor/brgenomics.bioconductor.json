    "Description": "This package provides useful and efficient utilites for the analysis of high-resolution genomic data using standard Bioconductor methods and classes. BRGenomics is feature-rich and simplifies a number of post-alignment processing steps and data handling. Emphasis is on efficient analysis of multiple datasets, with support for normalization and blacklisting. Included are functions for: spike-in normalizing data; generating basepair-resolution readcounts and coverage data (e.g. for heatmaps); importing and processing bam files (e.g. for conversion to bigWig files); generating metaplots/metaprofiles (bootstrapped mean profiles) with confidence intervals; conveniently calling DESeq2 without using sample-blind estimates of genewise dispersion; among other features.",
