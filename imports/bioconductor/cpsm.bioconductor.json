    "Description": "The CPSM package provides a comprehensive computational pipeline for predicting the survival probability of cancer patients. It offers a series of steps including data processing, splitting data into training and test subsets, and normalization of data. The package enables the selection of significant features based on univariate survival analysis and generates a LASSO prognostic index score. It supports the development of predictive models for survival probability using various features and provides visualization tools to draw survival curves based on predicted survival probabilities. Additionally, SPM includes functionalities for generating bar plots that depict the predicted mean and median survival times of patients, making it a versatile tool for survival analysis in cancer research.",
