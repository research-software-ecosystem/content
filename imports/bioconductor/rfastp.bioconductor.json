    "Description": "Rfastp is an R wrapper of fastp developed in c++.  fastp performs quality control for fastq files. including low quality bases trimming, polyX trimming, adapter auto-detection and trimming, paired-end reads merging, UMI sequence/id handling. Rfastp can concatenate multiple files into one file (like shell command cat) and accept multiple files as input.",
