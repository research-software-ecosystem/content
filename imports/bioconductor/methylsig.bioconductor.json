    "Description": "MethylSig is a package for testing for differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) or regions (DMRs) in whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) or reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) experiments.  MethylSig uses a beta binomial model to test for significant differences between groups of samples. Several options exist for either site-specific or sliding window tests, and variance estimation.",
