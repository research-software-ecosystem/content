    "Description": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are unique nucleic acid secondary structures predominantly found in guanine-rich regions and have been shown to be involved in various biological regulatory processes. G4SNVHunter is an R package designed to rapidly identify genomic sequences with G4-forming potential and accurately screen user-provided single nucleotide variants (also applicable to single nucleotide polymorphisms) that may destabilize these structures. This enables users to screen key variants for further experimental study, investigating how these variants may influence biological functions, such as gene regulation, by altering G4 formation.",
