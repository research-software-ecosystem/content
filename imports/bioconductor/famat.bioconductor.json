    "Description": "Famat is made to collect data about lists of genes and metabolites provided by user, and to visualize it through a Shiny app. Information collected is: - Pathways containing some of the user's genes and metabolites (obtained using a pathway enrichment analysis). - Direct interactions between user's elements inside pathways. - Information about elements (their identifiers and descriptions). - Go terms enrichment analysis performed on user's genes. The Shiny app is composed of: - information about genes, metabolites, and direct interactions between them inside pathways. - an heatmap showing which elements from the list are in pathways (pathways are structured in hierarchies). - hierarchies of enriched go terms using Molecular Function and Biological Process.",
