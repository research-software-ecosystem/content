    "Description": "This package detects significant differentially methylated regions (for both qualitative and quantitative traits), using a scan statistic with underlying Poisson heuristics. The scan statistic will depend on a sequence of window sizes (# of CpGs within each window) and on a threshold for each window size. This threshold can be calculated by three different means: i) analytically using Siegmund et.al (2012) solution (preferred), ii) an important sampling as suggested by Zhang (2008), and a iii) full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing between a number of different options for modeling the dependency between each CpG.",
