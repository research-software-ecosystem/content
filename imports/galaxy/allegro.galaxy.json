    "bio.tool_description": "It does simultaneous discovery of cis-regulatory motifs and their associated expression profiles. Its input are DNA sequences (typically, promoters or 3\u2032 UTRs) and genome-wide expression profiles. Its output is the set of motifs found, and for each motif the set of genes it regulates (its transcriptional module). It is highly efficient and can analyze expression profiles of thousands of genes, measured across dozens of experimental conditions, along with all regulatory sequences in the genome.",
