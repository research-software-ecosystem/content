    "Description": "GTDB-Tk is a software tool kit for assigning objective taxonomic classifications to bacterial and archaeal genomesbased on the Genome Database Taxonomy GTDB. It is designed to work with recent advances that allow hundreds orthousands of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to be obtained directly from environmental samples. It can alsobe applied to isolate and single-cell genomes. ",
