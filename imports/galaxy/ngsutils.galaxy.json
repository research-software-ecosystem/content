    "Description": "NGSUtils is a suite of software tools for working with next-generation sequencing datasets.Starting in 2009, we (Liu Lab @ Indiana University School of Medicine) starting working withnext-generation sequencing data. We initially started doing custom coding for each project in a one-off manner.It quickly became apparent that this was an inefficient manner to work, so we started assembling smallerutilities that could be adapted into larger, more complicated, workflows. We have used them for Illumia,SOLiD, 454, Ion Torrent, and Pac Bio sequencing data. We have used them for DNA and RNA resequcing,ChIP-Seq, CLIP-Seq, and targeted resequencing (Agilent exome capture and PCR targeting).These tools are also used heavily in our in-house DNA and RNA mapping pipelines.NGSUtils is made up of 50+ programs, mainly written in Python.These are separated into modules based on the type of file that is to be analyzed.",
