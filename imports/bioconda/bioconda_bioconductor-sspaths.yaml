about:
  description: This package generates pathway scores from expression data for single
    samples after training on a reference cohort. The score is generated by taking
    the expression of a gene set (pathway) from a reference cohort and performing
    linear discriminant analysis to distinguish samples in the cohort that have the
    pathway augmented and not. The separating hyperplane is then used to score new
    samples.
