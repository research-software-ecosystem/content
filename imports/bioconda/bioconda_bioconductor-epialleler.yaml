about:
  description: Epialleles are specific DNA methylation patterns that are mitotically
    and/or meiotically inherited. This package calls and reports cytosine methylation
    as well as frequencies of hypermethylated epialleles at the level of genomic regions
    or individual cytosines in next-generation sequencing data using binary alignment
    map (BAM) files as an input. Among other things, this package can also extract
    and visualise methylation patterns and assess allele specificity of methylation.
