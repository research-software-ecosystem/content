about:
  description: KneadData is a tool designed to perform quality control on metagenomic
    sequencing data, especially data from microbiome experiments. In these experiments,
    samples are typically taken from a host in hopes of learning something about the
    microbial community on the host. However, metagenomic sequencing data from such
    experiments will often contain a high ratio of host to bacterial reads. This tool
    aims to perform principled in silico separation of bacterial reads from these
    "contaminant" reads, be they from the host, from bacterial 16S sequences, or other
    user-defined sources.
