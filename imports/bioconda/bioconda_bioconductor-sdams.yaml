about:
  description: This Package utilizes a Semi-parametric Differential Abundance/expression
    analysis (SDA) method for metabolomics and proteomics data from mass spectrometry
    as well as single-cell RNA sequencing data. SDA is able to robustly handle non-normally
    distributed data and provides a clear quantification of the effect size.
