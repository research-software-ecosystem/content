about:
  description: The package obtains parameter estimation, i.e., maximum likelihood
    estimators (MLE), via the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for the Finite
    Mixture of Regression (FMR) models with Normal distribution, and MLE for the Finite
    Mixture of Accelerated Failure Time Regression (FMAFTR) subject to right censoring
    with Log-Normal and Weibull distributions via the EM algorithm and the Newton-Raphson
    algorithm (for Weibull distribution). More importantly, the package obtains the
    maximum penalized likelihood (MPLE) for both FMR and FMAFTR models (collectively
    called FMRs). A component-wise tuning parameter selection based on a component-wise
    BIC is implemented in the package. Furthermore, this package provides Ridge Regression
    and Elastic Net.
