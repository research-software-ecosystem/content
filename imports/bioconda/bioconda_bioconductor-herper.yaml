about:
  description: Many tools for data analysis are not available in R, but are present
    in public repositories like conda. The Herper package provides a comprehensive
    set of functions to interact with the conda package managament system. With Herper
    users can install, manage and run conda packages from the comfort of their R session.
    Herper also provides an ad-hoc approach to handling external system requirements
    for R packages. For people developing packages with python conda dependencies
    we recommend using basilisk (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/basilisk.html)
    to internally support these system requirments pre-hoc.
