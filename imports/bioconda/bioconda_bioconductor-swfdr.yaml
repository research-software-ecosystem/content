about:
  description: This package allows users to estimate the science-wise false discovery
    rate from Jager and Leek, "Empirical estimates suggest most published medical
    research is true," 2013, Biostatistics, using an EM approach due to the presence
    of rounding and censoring. It also allows users to estimate the false discovery
    rate conditional on covariates, using a regression framework, as per Boca and
    Leek, "A direct approach to estimating false discovery rates conditional on covariates,"
    2018, PeerJ.
