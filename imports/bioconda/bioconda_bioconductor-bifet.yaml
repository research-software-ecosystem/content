about:
  description: BiFET identifies TFs whose footprints are over-represented in target
    regions compared to background regions after correcting for the bias arising from
    the imbalance in read counts and GC contents between the target and background
    regions. For a given TF k, BiFET tests the null hypothesis that the target regions
    have the same probability of having footprints for the TF k as the background
    regions while correcting for the read count and GC content bias. For this, we
    use the number of target regions with footprints for TF k, t_k as a test statistic
    and calculate the p-value as the probability of observing t_k or more target regions
    with footprints under the null hypothesis.
