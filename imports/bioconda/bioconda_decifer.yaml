about:
  description: 'DeCiFer is an algorithm that simultaneously selects mutation multiplicities
    and clusters SNVs by their corresponding descendant cell fractions (DCF), a statistic
    that quantifies the proportion of cells which acquired the SNV or whose ancestors
    acquired the SNV. DCF is related to the commonly used cancer cell fraction (CCF)
    but further accounts for SNVs which are lost due to deleterious somatic copy-number
    aberrations (CNAs), identifying clusters of SNVs which occur in the same phylogenetic
    branch of tumour evolution.
