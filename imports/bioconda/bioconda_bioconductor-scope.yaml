about:
  description: 'Whole genome single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) enables characterization
    of copy number profiles at the cellular level. This circumvents the averaging
    effects associated with bulk-tissue sequencing and has increased resolution yet
    decreased ambiguity in deconvolving cancer subclones and elucidating cancer evolutionary
    history. ScDNA-seq data is, however, sparse, noisy, and highly variable even within
    a homogeneous cell population, due to the biases and artifacts that are introduced
    during the library preparation and sequencing procedure. Here, we propose SCOPE,
    a normalization and copy number estimation method for scDNA-seq data. The distinguishing
    features of SCOPE include: (i) utilization of cell-specific Gini coefficients
    for quality controls and for identification of normal/diploid cells, which are
    further used as negative control samples in a Poisson latent factor model for
    normalization; (ii) modeling of GC content bias using an expectation-maximization
    algorithm embedded in the Poisson generalized linear models, which accounts for
    the different copy number states along the genome; (iii) a cross-sample iterative
    segmentation procedure to identify breakpoints that are shared across cells from
    the same genetic background.'
