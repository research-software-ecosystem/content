about:
  description: Implements utilities for installation of the basilisk package, primarily
    for creation of the underlying Conda instance. This allows us to avoid re-writing
    the same R code in both the configure script (for centrally administered R installations)
    and in the lazy installation mechanism (for distributed package binaries). It
    is highly unlikely that developers - or, heaven forbid, end-users! - will need
    to interact with this package directly; they should be using the basilisk package
    instead.
