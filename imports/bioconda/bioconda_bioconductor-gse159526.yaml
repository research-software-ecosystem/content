  description: 19 term and 9 first trimester placental chorionic villi and matched
    cell-sorted samples ran on Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC DNA methylation microarrays.
    This data was made available on GEO accession [GSE159526](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE159526).
    Both the raw and processed data has been made available on \code{ExperimentHub}.
    Raw unprocessed data formatted as an RGChannelSet object for integration and normalization
    using minfi and other existing Bioconductor packages. Processed normalized data
    is also available as a DNA methylation \code{matrix}, with a corresponding phenotype
    information as a \code{data.frame} object.
