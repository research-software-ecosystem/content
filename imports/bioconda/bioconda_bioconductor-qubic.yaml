about:
  description: 'The core function of this R package is to provide the implementation
    of the well-cited and well-reviewed QUBIC algorithm, aiming to deliver an effective
    and efficient biclustering capability. This package also includes the following
    related functions: (i) a qualitative representation of the input gene expression
    data, through a well-designed discretization way considering the underlying data
    property, which can be directly used in other biclustering programs; (ii) visualization
    of identified biclusters using heatmap in support of overall expression pattern
    analysis; (iii) bicluster-based co-expression network elucidation and visualization,
    where different correlation coefficient scores between a pair of genes are provided;
    and (iv) a generalize output format of biclusters and corresponding network can
    be freely downloaded so that a user can easily do following comprehensive functional
    enrichment analysis (e.g. DAVID) and advanced network visualization (e.g. Cytoscape).'
