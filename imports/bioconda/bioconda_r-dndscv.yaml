about:
  description: 'Description: This package contains functions for studying selection
    on coding

    sequences using a Poisson implementation of dN/dS. A Poisson model of dN/dS

    facilitates the study of selection beyond traditional codon models, including

    complex context-dependent mutation effects and selection on nonsense and

    splice site mutations. This model is best suited for resequencing studies,

    with very low density of mutations per base pair. The model was initially

    developed for cancer genome sequencing studies, and specific functions are

    provided to perform driver gene discovery using the dNdScv method on human

    cancer genomic data.
