about:
  description: 'Functions for forward population genetic simulation in asexual populations,
    with special focus on cancer progression. Fitness can be an arbitrary function
    of genetic interactions between multiple genes or modules of genes, including
    epistasis, order restrictions in mutation accumulation, and order effects. Fitness
    (including just birth, just death, or both birth and death) can also be a function
    of the relative and absolute frequencies of other genotypes (i.e., frequency-dependent
    fitness). Mutation rates can differ between genes, and we can include mutator/antimutator
    genes (to model mutator phenotypes). Simulating multi-species scenarios and therapeutic
    interventions, including adaptive therapy, is also possible. Simulations use continuous-time
    models and can include driver and passenger genes and modules. Also included are
    functions for: simulating random DAGs of the type found in Oncogenetic Trees,
    Conjunctive Bayesian Networks, and other cancer progression models; plotting and
    sampling from single or multiple realizations of the simulations, including single-cell
    sampling; plotting the parent-child relationships of the clones; generating random
    fitness landscapes (Rough Mount Fuji, House of Cards, additive, NK, Ising, and
    Eggbox models) and plotting them.'
