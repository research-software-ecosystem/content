about:
  description: receptLoss identifies genes whose expression is lost in subsets of
    tumors relative to normal tissue. It is particularly well-suited in cases where
    the number of normal tissue samples is small, as the distribution of gene expression
    in normal tissue samples is approximated by a Gaussian. Originally designed for
    identifying nuclear hormone receptor expression loss but can be applied transcriptome
    wide as well.
