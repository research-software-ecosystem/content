about:
  description: 'MSFragger is an ultrafast database search tool for peptide identification
    in mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

    It has demonstrated excellent performance across a wide range of datasets and
    applications.

    MSFragger is suitable for standard shotgun proteomics analyses as well as large
    datasets (including timsTOF PASEF data),

    enzyme unconstrained searches (e.g., peptidome),

    open database searches (e.g., precursor mass tolerance set to hundreds of Daltons)
    for identification

    of modified peptides, and glycopeptide identification (N-linked and O-linked).


    MSFragger is available freely for academic research and educational purposes only,
    in accordance with the terms at https://msfragger.arsci.com/upgrader/MSFragger-LICENSE.pdf.
