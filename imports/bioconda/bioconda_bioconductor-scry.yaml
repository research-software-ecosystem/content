about:
  description: Many modern biological datasets consist of small counts that are not
    well fit by standard linear-Gaussian methods such as principal component analysis.
    This package provides implementations of count-based feature selection and dimension
    reduction algorithms. These methods can be used to facilitate unsupervised analysis
    of any high-dimensional data such as single-cell RNA-seq.
