about:
  description: immunoClust is a model based clustering approach for Flow Cytometry
    samples. The cell-events of single Flow Cytometry samples are modelled by a mixture
    of multinominal normal- or t-distributions. The cell-event clusters of several
    samples are modelled by a mixture of multinominal normal-distributions aiming
    stable co-clusters across these samples.
