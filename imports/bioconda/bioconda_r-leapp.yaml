  summary: These functions take a gene expression value matrix, a primary covariate
    vector, an additional known covariates matrix.  A two stage analysis is applied
    to counter the effects of latent variables on the rankings of hypotheses.  The
    estimation and adjustment of latent effects are proposed by Sun, Zhang and Owen
    (2011).  "leapp" is developed in the context of microarray experiments, but may
    be used as a general tool for high throughput data sets where dependence may be
    involved.
