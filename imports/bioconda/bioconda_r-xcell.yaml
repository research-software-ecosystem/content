about:
  description: '"Tissues are a complex milieu consisting of numerous cell types. In
    cancer, understanding the cellular heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment
    is an emerging field of research. Numerous methods have been published in recent
    years for the enumeration of cell subsets from tissue expression profiles. However,
    the available methods suffer from three major problems: inferring cell subset
    based on gene sets learned and verified from limited sources; displaying only
    partial portrayal of the full cellular heterogeneity; and insufficient validation
    in mixed tissues. The xCell package performs cell type enrichment analysis from
    gene expression data for 64 immune and stroma cell types. xCell is a gene signatures-based
    method learned from thousands of pure cell types from various sources. xCell applies
    a novel technique for reducing associations between closley related cell types.
    xCell signatures were validated using extensive in-silico simulations and also
    cytometry immunophenotyping, and were shown to outperform previous methods. xCell
    allows researchers to reliably portray the cellular heterogeneity landscape of
    tissue expression profiles."
