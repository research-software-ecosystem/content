about:
  description: Synapsis is a Bioconductor software package for automated (unbiased
    and reproducible) analysis of meiotic immunofluorescence datasets. The primary
    functions of the software can i) identify cells in meiotic prophase that are labelled
    by a synaptonemal complex axis or central element protein, ii) isolate individual
    synaptonemal complexes and measure their physical length, iii) quantify foci and
    co-localise them with synaptonemal complexes, iv) measure interference between
    synaptonemal complex-associated foci. The software has applications that extend
    to multiple species and to the analysis of other proteins that label meiotic prophase
    chromosomes. The software converts meiotic immunofluorescence images into R data
    frames that are compatible with machine learning methods. Given a set of microscopy
    images of meiotic spread slides, synapsis crops images around individual single
    cells, counts colocalising foci on strands on a per cell basis, and measures the
    distance between foci on any given strand.
