  description: A first step in the data analysis of Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics
    data is to identify peptides and proteins. With this respect the huge number of
    experimental mass spectra typically have to be assigned to theoretical peptides
    derived from a sequence database. Search engines are used for this purpose. These
    tools compare each of the observed spectra to all candidate theoretical spectra
    derived from the sequence data base and calculate a score for each comparison.
    The observed spectrum is then assigned to the theoretical peptide with the best
    score, which is also referred to as the peptide to spectrum match (PSM). It is
    of course crucial for the downstream analysis to evaluate the quality of these
    matches. Therefore False Discovery Rate (FDR) control is used to return a reliable
    list PSMs. The FDR, however, requires a good characterisation of the score distribution
    of PSMs that are matched to the wrong peptide (bad target hits). In proteomics,
    the target decoy approach (TDA) is typically used for this purpose. The TDA method
    matches the spectra to a database of real (targets) and nonsense peptides (decoys).
    A popular approach to generate these decoys is to reverse the target database.
    Hence, all the PSMs that match to a decoy are known to be bad hits and the distribution
    of their scores are used to estimate the distribution of the bad scoring target
    PSMs. A crucial assumption of the TDA is that the decoy PSM hits have similar
    properties as bad target hits so that the decoy PSM scores are a good simulation
    of the target PSM scores. Users, however, typically do not evaluate these assumptions.
    To this end we developed TargetDecoy to generate diagnostic plots to evaluate
    the quality of the target decoy method.
