about:
  description: 'VirProf is a dual RNA-seq analysis pipeline integrating host

    expression profile generation with virus identification,

    quantification, and genome recovery from host tissue RNA

    sequencing data. VirProf combines an unguided metagenomic assembly

    workflow with interleaved host read depletion followed by BLAST

    based binning, scaffolding and classification. Application of

    VirProf to poly-A selected RNA-seq data from nasal swabs with

    respiratory virus qPCR data, revealed that VirProf was able to a)

    quantify a range of viral infections at detection limits and

    precision comparable to qPCR and b) recover complete, accurate

    viral genomes suitable for phylogenetic analysis.
