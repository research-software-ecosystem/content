  description: 'sracat is small C++ program that uses the NCBI sra-toolkit C++ API
    to

    extract sequence (and optionally quailty scores) from SRA records. Unlike

    the fasterq-dump program included with the sra-toolkit, sracat does not

    output the reads in their origianlly submitted order, but rather outputs

    reads in the order in which they are stored in the SRA file.
