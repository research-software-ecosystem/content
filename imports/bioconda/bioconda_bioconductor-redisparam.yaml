about:
  description: This package provides a Redis-based back-end for BiocParallel, enabling
    an alternative mechanism for distributed computation. The The 'manager' distributes
    tasks to a 'worker' pool through a central Redis server, rather than directly
    to workers as with other BiocParallel implementations. This means that the worker
    pool can change dynamically during job evaluation. All features of BiocParallel
    are supported, including reproducible random number streams, logging to the manager,
    and alternative 'load balancing' task distributions.
