  description: Mutations that rapidly accumulate in viral genomes during a pandemic
    can be used to track the evolution of the virus and, accordingly, unravel the
    viral infection network. To this extent, sequencing samples of the virus can be
    employed to estimate models from genomic epidemiology and may serve, for instance,
    to estimate the proportion of undetected infected people by uncovering cryptic
    transmissions, as well as to predict likely trends in the number of infected,
    hospitalized, dead and recovered people. VERSO is an algorithmic framework that
    processes variants profiles from viral samples to produce phylogenetic models
    of viral evolution. The approach solves a Boolean Matrix Factorization problem
    with phylogenetic constraints, by maximizing a log-likelihood function. VERSO
    includes two separate and subsequent steps; in this package we provide an R implementation
    of VERSO STEP 1.
