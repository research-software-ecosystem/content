about:
  description: scBubbletree is a quantitative method for the visual exploration of
    scRNA-seq data, preserving key biological properties such as local and global
    cell distances and cell density distributions across samples. It effectively resolves
    overplotting and enables the visualization of diverse cell attributes from multiomic
    single-cell experiments. Additionally, scBubbletree is user-friendly and integrates
    seamlessly with popular scRNA-seq analysis tools, facilitating comprehensive and
    intuitive data interpretation.
