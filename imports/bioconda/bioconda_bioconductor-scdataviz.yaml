about:
  description: In the single cell World, which includes flow cytometry, mass cytometry,
    single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), and others, there is a need to improve data visualisation
    and to bring analysis capabilities to researchers even from non-technical backgrounds.
    scDataviz attempts to fit into this space, while also catering for advanced users.
    Additonally, due to the way that scDataviz is designed, which is based on SingleCellExperiment,
    it has a 'plug and play' feel, and immediately lends itself as flexibile and compatibile
    with studies that go beyond scDataviz. Finally, the graphics in scDataviz are
    generated via the ggplot engine, which means that users can 'add on' features
    to these with ease.
