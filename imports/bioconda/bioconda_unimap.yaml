about:
  description: 'Unimap is a fork of minimap2 optimized for assembly-to-reference alignment.
    It integrates the minigraph chaining algorithm and can align through long INDELs
    (up to 100kb by default) much faster than minimap2. Unimap is a better fit for
    resolving segmental duplications and is recommended over minimap2 for alignment
    between high-quality assemblies.


    Unimap does not replace minimap2 for other types of alignment. It drops the support
    of multi-part index and short-read mapping. Its long-read alignment is different
    from minimap2 but is not necessarily better. Unimap is more of a specialized minimap2
    at the moment.'
