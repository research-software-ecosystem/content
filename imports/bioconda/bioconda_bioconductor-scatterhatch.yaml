about:
  description: The objective of this package is to efficiently create scatterplots
    where groups can be distinguished by color and texture. Visualizations in computational
    biology tend to have many groups making it difficult to distinguish between groups
    solely on color. Thus, this package is useful for increasing the accessibility
    of scatterplot visualizations to those with visual impairments such as color blindness.
