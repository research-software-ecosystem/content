  description: 'architeuthis is a fast standalone command to supplement the Kraken
    suite of software

    tools such like Kraken2, KrakenUniq, and Bracken. I saw myself repeatedly rewriting

    the same code in my pipelines when dealing with Kraken output, like merging files
    or

    maninpulating lineage annotations. It also adds some functionality to dive deeper

    into the individual k-mer classifications for reads.
