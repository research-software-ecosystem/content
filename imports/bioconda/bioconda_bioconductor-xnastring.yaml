about:
  description: The XNAString package allows for description of base sequences and
    associated chemical modifications in a single object. XNAString is able to capture
    single stranded, as well as double stranded molecules. Chemical modifications
    are represented as independent strings associated with different features of the
    molecules (base sequence, sugar sequence, backbone sequence, modifications) and
    can be read or written to a HELM notation. It also enables secondary structure
    prediction using RNAfold from ViennaRNA. XNAString is designed to be efficient
    representation of nucleic-acid based therapeutics, therefore it stores information
    about target sequences and provides interface for matching and alignment functions
    from Biostrings and pwalign packages.
