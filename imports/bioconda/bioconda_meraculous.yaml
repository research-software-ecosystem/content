  summary: 'Meraculous is a whole genome assembler for Next Generation Sequencing
    data, geared for large genomes. It''s hybrid k-mer/read-based approach capitalizes
    on the high accuracy of Illumina sequence by eschewing an explicit error correction
    step which we argue to be redundant with the assembly process. Meraculous achieves
    high performance with large datasets by utilizing lightweight data structures
    and multi-threaded parallelization, allowing to assemble human-sized genomes on
    a high-cpu cluster in under a day. The process pipeline implements a highly transparent
    and portable model of job control and monitoring where different assembly stages
    can be executed and re-executed separately or in unison on a wide variety of architectures.
