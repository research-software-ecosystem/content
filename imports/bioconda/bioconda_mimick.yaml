about:
  description: 'Mimick, formerly known as XENIA from the VISOR project, is a simple
    but effective way of

    simulating linked-read FASTQ data (10x, haplotagging, stlfr, tellseq). Mimick
    allows

    you to simulate an arbitrary number of haplotypes, set overall coverage, molecule
    coverage,

    and mix-match barcodes with linked-read chemistries.
