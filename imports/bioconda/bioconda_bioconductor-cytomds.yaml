about:
  description: This package implements a low dimensional visualization of a set of
    cytometry samples, in order to visually assess the 'distances' between them. This,
    in turn, can greatly help the user to identify quality issues like batch effects
    or outlier samples, and/or check the presence of potential sample clusters that
    might align with the exeprimental design. The CytoMDS algorithm combines, on the
    one hand, the concept of Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), a.k.a. Wasserstein metric
    and, on the other hand, the Multi Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm for the
    low dimensional projection. Also, the package provides some diagnostic tools for
    both checking the quality of the MDS projection, as well as tools to help with
    the interpretation of the axes of the projection.
