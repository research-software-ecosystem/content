  description: CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats) coupled
    with nuclease Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) screens represent a promising technology to systematically
    evaluate gene functions. Data analysis for CRISPR/Cas9 screens is a critical process
    that includes identifying screen hits and exploring biological functions for these
    hits in downstream analysis. We have previously developed two algorithms, MAGeCK
    and MAGeCK-VISPR, to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screen data in various scenarios. These
    two algorithms allow users to perform quality control, read count generation and
    normalization, and calculate beta score to evaluate gene selection performance.
    In downstream analysis, the biological functional analysis is required for understanding
    biological functions of these identified genes with different screening purposes.
    Here, We developed MAGeCKFlute for supporting downstream analysis. MAGeCKFlute
    provides several strategies to remove potential biases within sgRNA-level read
    counts and gene-level beta scores. The downstream analysis with the package includes
    identifying essential, non-essential, and target-associated genes, and performing
    biological functional category analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and protein
    complex enrichment analysis of these genes. The package also visualizes genes
    in multiple ways to benefit users exploring screening data. Collectively, MAGeCKFlute
    enables accurate identification of essential, non-essential, and targeted genes,
    as well as their related biological functions. This vignette explains the use
    of the package and demonstrates typical workflows.
