about:
  description: 'IsoCorrectoR performs the correction of mass spectrometry data from
    stable isotope labeling/tracing metabolomics experiments with regard to natural
    isotope abundance and tracer impurity. Data from both MS and MS/MS measurements
    can be corrected (with any tracer isotope: 13C, 15N, 18O...), as well as ultra-high
    resolution MS data from multiple-tracer experiments (e.g. 13C and 15N used simultaneously).
    See the Bioconductor package IsoCorrectoRGUI for a graphical user interface to
    IsoCorrectoR. NOTE: With R version 4.0.0, writing correction results to Excel
    files may currently not work on Windows. However, writing results to csv works
    as before.'
