  description: "Cell clustering is one of the most important and commonly performed\
    \ tasks in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. An important\
    \ step in cell clustering is to select a subset of genes (referred to as \u201C\
    features\u201D), whose expression patterns will then be used for downstream clustering.\
    \ A good set of features should include the ones that distinguish different cell\
    \ types, and the quality of such set could have significant impact on the clustering\
    \ accuracy. FEAST is an R library for selecting most representative features before\
    \ performing the core of scRNA-seq clustering. It can be used as a plug-in for\
    \ the etablished clustering algorithms such as SC3, TSCAN, SHARP, SIMLR, and Seurat.\
    \ The core of FEAST algorithm includes three steps: 1. consensus clustering; 2.\
    \ gene-level significance inference; 3. validation of an optimized feature set."
