  summary: 'Makes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) data
    analysis as easy as possible by only requiring a small set of functions to perform
    an entire analysis. ''speaq'' offers the possibility of raw spectra alignment
    and quantitation but also an analysis based on features whereby the spectra are
    converted to peaks which are then grouped and turned into features. These features
    can be processed with any number of statistical tools either included in ''speaq''
    or available elsewhere on CRAN. More detail can be found in Vu et al. (2011) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-12-405>
    and Beirnaert et al. (2018) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006018>. '
