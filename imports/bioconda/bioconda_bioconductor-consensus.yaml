about:
  description: An implementation of the American Society for Testing and Materials
    (ASTM) Standard E691 for interlaboratory testing procedures, designed for cross-platform
    genomic measurements. Given three (3) or more genomic platforms or laboratory
    protocols, this package provides interlaboratory testing procedures giving per-locus
    comparisons for sensitivity and precision between platforms.
