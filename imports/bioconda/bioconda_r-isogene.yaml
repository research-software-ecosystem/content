  summary: 'Offers framework for testing for monotonic relationship between gene expression
    and doses in a microarray experiment. Several testing procedures including the
    global likelihood-ratio test (Bartholomew, 1961), Williams (1971, 1972), Marcus
    (1976), M (Hu et al. 2005) and the modified M (Lin et al. 2007) are used to test
    for the monotonic trend in gene expression with respect to doses. BH (Benjamini
    and Hochberg 1995) and BY (Benjamini and Yekutieli 2004) FDR controlling procedures
    are applied to adjust the raw p-values obtained from the permutations.   '
