about:
  description: The CellScore package contains functions to evaluate the cell identity
    of a test sample, given a cell transition defined with a starting (donor) cell
    type and a desired target cell type. The evaluation is based upon a scoring system,
    which uses a set of standard samples of known cell types, as the reference set.
    The functions have been carried out on a large set of microarray data from one
    platform (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0). In principle, the method could
    be applied to any expression dataset, provided that there are a sufficient number
    of standard samples and that the data are normalized.
