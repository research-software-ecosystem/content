about:
  description: Provides functions for inferring continuous, branching lineage structures
    in low-dimensional data. Slingshot was designed to model developmental trajectories
    in single-cell RNA sequencing data and serve as a component in an analysis pipeline
    after dimensionality reduction and clustering. It is flexible enough to handle
    arbitrarily many branching events and allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge
    through supervised graph construction.
