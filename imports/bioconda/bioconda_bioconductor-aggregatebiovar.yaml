about:
  description: For single cell RNA-seq data collected from more than one subject (e.g.
    biological sample or technical replicates), this package contains tools to summarize
    single cell gene expression profiles at the level of subject. A SingleCellExperiment
    object is taken as input and converted to a list of SummarizedExperiment objects,
    where each list element corresponds to an assigned cell type. The SummarizedExperiment
    objects contain aggregate gene-by-subject count matrices and inter-subject column
    metadata for individual subjects that can be processed using downstream bulk RNA-seq
    tools.
