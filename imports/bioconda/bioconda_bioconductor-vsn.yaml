about:
  description: The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities
    from single- and multiple-color arrays. It can also be used for data from other
    technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses a robust variant
    of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-multiplicative error model
    and affine calibration. The model incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a. normalization),
    a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity and a variance
    stabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed intensities are
    analogous to "normalized log-ratios". However, in contrast to the latter, their
    variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive and specific
    in detecting differential transcription.
