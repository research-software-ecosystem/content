  summary: Create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistics with the 'lipidomeR'. The 'lipidomeR'
    provides a streamlined pipeline for the systematic interpretation of the lipidome
    through publication-ready visualizations of regression models fitted on lipidomics
    data. With 'lipidomeR', associations between covariates and the lipidome can be
    interpreted systematically and intuitively through heatmaps, where lipids are
    categorized by the lipid class and are presented on two-dimensional maps organized
    by the lipid size and level of saturation. This way, the 'lipidomeR' helps you
    gain an immediate understanding of the multivariate patterns in the lipidome already
    at first glance. You can create lipidome-wide heatmaps of statistical associations,
    changes, differences, variation, or other lipid-specific values. The heatmaps
    are provided with publication-ready quality and the results behind the visualizations
    are based on rigorous statistical models.
