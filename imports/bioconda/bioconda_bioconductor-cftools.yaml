  description: 'The cfTools R package provides methods for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation
    data analysis to facilitate cfDNA-based studies. Given the methylation sequencing
    data of a cfDNA sample, for each cancer marker or tissue marker, we deconvolve
    the tumor-derived or tissue-specific reads from all reads falling in the marker
    region. Our read-based deconvolution algorithm exploits the pervasiveness of DNA
    methylation for signal enhancement, therefore can sensitively identify a trace
    amount of tumor-specific or tissue-specific cfDNA in plasma. cfTools provides
    functions for (1) cancer detection: sensitively detect tumor-derived cfDNA and
    estimate the tumor-derived cfDNA fraction (tumor burden); (2) tissue deconvolution:
    infer the tissue type composition and the cfDNA fraction of multiple tissue types
    for a plasma cfDNA sample. These functions can serve as foundations for more advanced
    cfDNA-based studies, including cancer diagnosis and disease monitoring.'
