about:
  description: "Discordant is an R package that identifies pairs of features that\
    \ correlate differently between phenotypic groups, with application to -omics\
    \ data sets. Discordant uses a mixture model that \u201Cbins\u201D molecular feature\
    \ pairs based on their type of coexpression or coabbundance. Algorithm is explained\
    \ further in \"Differential Correlation for Sequencing Data\"\" (Siska et al.\
    \ 2016)."
