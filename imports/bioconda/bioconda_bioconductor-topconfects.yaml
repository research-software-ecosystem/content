about:
  description: Rank results by confident effect sizes, while maintaining False Discovery
    Rate and False Coverage-statement Rate control. Topconfects is an alternative
    presentation of TREAT results with improved usability, eliminating p-values and
    instead providing confidence bounds. The main application is differential gene
    expression analysis, providing genes ranked in order of confident log2 fold change,
    but it can be applied to any collection of effect sizes with associated standard
    errors.
