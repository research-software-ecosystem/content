about:
  description: GoPeaks is a peak caller designed for CUT&TAG/CUT&RUN sequencing data.
    GoPeaks by default works best with narrow peaks such as H3K4me3 and transcription
    factors. However, broad epigenetic marks like H3K27Ac/H3K4me1 require different
    the step, slide, and minwidth parameters. We encourage users to explore the parameters
    of GoPeaks to analyze their data.
