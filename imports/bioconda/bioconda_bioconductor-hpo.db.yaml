about:
  description: Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) was developed to create a consistent
    description of gene products with disease perspectives, and is essential for supporting
    functional genomics in disease context. Accurate disease descriptions can discover
    new relationships between genes and disease, and new functions for previous uncharacteried
    genes and alleles.We have developed the [DOSE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DOSE/)
    package for semantic similarity analysis and disease enrichment analysis, and
    `DOSE` import an Bioconductor package 'DO.db' to get the relationship(such as
    parent and child) between MPO terms. But `DO.db` hasn't been updated for years,
    and a lot of semantic information is [missing](https://github.com/YuLab-SMU/DOSE/issues/57).
    So we developed the new package `HPO.db` for Human Human Phenotype Ontology annotation.
