about:
  description: 'grenedalf is a collection of commands for working with population
    genetic data, in particular from pool sequencing.

    Its main focus are statistical analyses such as Tajima''s D and Fst. The statistics
    follow the approaches of PoPoolation

    and PoPoolation2, as well as poolfstat and npstat. However, compared to those,
    grenedalf is significantly more scalable,

    more user friendly, and offers more settings and input file formats.
