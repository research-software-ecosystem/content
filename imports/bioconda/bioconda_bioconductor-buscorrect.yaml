about:
  description: High-throughput experimental data are accumulating exponentially in
    public databases. However, mining valid scientific discoveries from these abundant
    resources is hampered by technical artifacts and inherent biological heterogeneity.
    The former are usually termed "batch effects," and the latter is often modelled
    by "subtypes." The R package BUScorrect fits a Bayesian hierarchical model, the
    Batch-effects-correction-with-Unknown-Subtypes model (BUS), to correct batch effects
    in the presence of unknown subtypes. BUS is capable of (a) correcting batch effects
    explicitly, (b) grouping samples that share similar characteristics into subtypes,
    (c) identifying features that distinguish subtypes, and (d) enjoying a linear-order
    computation complexity.
