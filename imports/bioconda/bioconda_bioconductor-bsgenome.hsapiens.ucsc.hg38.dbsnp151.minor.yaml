  description: Full genome sequences for Homo sapiens (Human) as provided by UCSC
    (hg38, based on GRCh38.p12) with minor alleles injected from dbSNP151, and stored
    in Biostrings objects. Full genome sequences for Homo sapiens (Human) as provided
    by UCSC (hg38, based on GRCh38.p12) with minor alleles injected from dbSNP151,
    and stored in Biostrings objects. Only common single nucleotide variants (SNVs)
    with at least one alternate allele with frequency greater than 0.01 were considered.
    For SNVs with more than 1 alternate allele, the most frequent allele was chosen
    as the minor allele to be injected into the reference genome.
