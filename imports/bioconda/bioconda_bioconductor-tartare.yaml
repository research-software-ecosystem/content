about:
  description: Provides raw files recorded on different Liquid Chromatography Mass
    Spectrometry (LC-MS) instruments. All included MS instruments are manufactured
    by Thermo Fisher Scientific and belong to the Orbitrap Tribrid or Q Exactive Orbitrap
    family of instruments. Despite their common origin and shared hardware components,
    e.g., Orbitrap mass analyser, the above instruments tend to write data in different
    "dialects" in a shared binary file format (.raw). The intention behind tartare
    is to provide complex but slim real-world files that can be used to make code
    robust with respect to this diversity. In other words, it is intended for enhanced
    unit testing. The package is considered to be used with the rawrr package and
    the Spectra MsBackends.
