about:
  description: adverSCarial is an R Package designed for generating and analyzing
    the vulnerability of scRNA-seq classifiers to adversarial attacks. The package
    is versatile and provides a format for integrating any type of classifier. It
    offers functions for studying and generating two types of attacks, single gene
    attack and max change attack. The single-gene attack involves making a small modification
    to the input to alter the classification. The max-change attack involves making
    a large modification to the input without changing its classification. The package
    provides a comprehensive solution for evaluating the robustness of scRNA-seq classifiers
    against adversarial attacks.
