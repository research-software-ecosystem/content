about:
  description: Defines and includes a set of class-based templates for developing
    and implementing data processing and analysis workflows, with a strong emphasis
    on statistics and machine learning. The templates can be used and where needed
    extended to 'wrap' tools and methods from other packages into a common standardised
    structure to allow for effective and fast integration. Model objects can be combined
    into sequences, and sequences nested in iterators using overloaded operators to
    simplify and improve readability of the code. Ontology lookup has been integrated
    and implemented to provide standardised definitions for methods, inputs and outputs
    wrapped using the class-based templates.
