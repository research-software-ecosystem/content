about:
  description: 'RRIkinDP evaluated thermodynamic and kinetic features of RNA-RNA interactions.
    As input, two RNA

    sequences as well as their interaction structure is provided. The tool generates
    the state space of

    all intermediate interactions from single base pair interactions to the full input
    interaction.

    On top of this state space it computes the barrier energy for the best direct
    path from a given

    start interaction to the full input interaction.
