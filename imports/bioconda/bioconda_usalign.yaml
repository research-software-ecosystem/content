about:
  description: "US-align (Universal Structural alignment) is a unified protocol\n\
    to compare 3D structures of different macromolecules (proteins, RNAs and DNAs)\n\
    in different forms (monomers, oligomers and heterocomplexes)\nfor both pairwise\
    \ and multiple structure alignments.\nThe core alogrithm of US-align is extended\
    \ from TM-align and generates optimal structural alignments\nby maximizing TM-score\
    \ of compared strucures through heuristic dynamic programming iterations.\nLarge-scale\
    \ benchmark tests showed that US-align can generate more accurate structural alignments\n\
    with significantly reduced CPU time, compared to the state-of-the-art methods\
    \ developed\nfor specific structural alignment tasks.\nTM-score has values in\
    \ (0,1] with 1 indicating an identical structure match,\nwhere a TM-score \u2265\
    0.5 (or 0.45) means the structures share the same global topology for proteins\
    \ (or RNAs).\n"
