about:
  description: "Cyntenator identifies conserved syntenic blocks between multiple genomes.\
    \ The program computes Smith-Waterman alignments of sequences, whereby the alphabet\
    \ consists of all annotated genes and the scoring system is defined by protein\
    \ sequence similarities and distances between species in a phylogenetic tree.\
    \ The algorithm is an extension of the Syntenator partial order aligner, described\
    \ in R\xF6delsperger and Dieterich, 2008."
