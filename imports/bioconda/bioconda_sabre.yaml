  description: 'Next-generation sequencing can currently produce hundreds of millions
    of

    reads per lane of sample and that number increases at a dizzying rate.

    Barcoding individual sequences for multiple lines or multiple species is a

    cost-efficient method to sequence and analyze a broad range of data. Sabre

    is a tool that will demultiplex barcoded reads into separate files. It

    will work on both single-end and paired-end data in fastq format. It

    simply compares the provided barcodes with each read and separates the

    read into its appropriate barcode file, after stripping the barcode from

    the read (and also stripping the quality values of the barcode bases). If

    a read does not have a recognized barcode, then it is put into the unknown

    file. Sabre also has an option (-m) to allow mismatches of the barcodes.

    Sabre also supports gzipped file inputs. Also, since sabre does not use

    the quality values in any way, it can be used on fasta data that is

    converted to fastq by creating fake quality values. Finally, after

    demultiplexing, sabre outputs a summary of how many records went into each

    barcode file.'
