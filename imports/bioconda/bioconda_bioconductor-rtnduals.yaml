about:
  description: RTNduals is a tool that searches for possible co-regulatory loops between
    regulon pairs generated by the RTN package. It compares the shared targets in
    order to infer 'dual regulons', a new concept that tests whether regulators can
    co-operate or compete in influencing targets.
