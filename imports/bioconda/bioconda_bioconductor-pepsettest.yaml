about:
  description: Peptide Set Test (PepSetTest) is a peptide-centric strategy to infer
    differentially expressed proteins in LC-MS/MS proteomics data. This test detects
    coordinated changes in the expression of peptides originating from the same protein
    and compares these changes against the rest of the peptidome. Compared to traditional
    aggregation-based approaches, the peptide set test demonstrates improved statistical
    power, yet controlling the Type I error rate correctly in most cases. This test
    can be valuable for discovering novel biomarkers and prioritizing drug targets,
    especially when the direct application of statistical analysis to protein data
    fails to provide substantial insights.
