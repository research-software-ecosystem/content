about:
  description: Clonal cell groups share common mutations within cancer, precancer,
    and even clinically normal appearing tissues. The frequency and location of these
    mutations may predict prognosis and cancer risk. It has also been well established
    that certain genomic regions have increased sensitivity to acquiring mutations.
    Mutation-sensitive genomic regions may therefore serve as markers for predicting
    cancer risk. This package contains multiple functions to establish significantly
    mutated hotspots, compare hotspot mutation burden between samples, and perform
    exploratory data analysis of the correlation between hotspot mutation burden and
    personal risk factors for cancer, such as age, gender, and history of carcinogen
    exposure. This package allows users to identify robust genomic markers to help
    establish cancer risk.
