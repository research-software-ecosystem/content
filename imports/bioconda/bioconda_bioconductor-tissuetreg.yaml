about:
  description: 'The package provides ready to use epigenomes (obtained from TWGBS)
    and transcriptomes (RNA-seq) from various tissues as obtained in the study (Delacher
    and Imbusch 2017, PMID: 28783152). Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) perform two
    distinct functions: they maintain self-tolerance, and they support organ homeostasis
    by differentiating into specialized tissue Treg cells. The underlying dataset
    characterises the epigenetic and transcriptomic modifications for specialized
    tissue Treg cells.'
