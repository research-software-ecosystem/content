about:
  description: dominoSignal is a package developed to analyze cell signaling through
    ligand - receptor - transcription factor networks in scRNAseq data. It takes as
    input information transcriptomic data, requiring counts, z-scored counts, and
    cluster labels, as well as information on transcription factor activation (such
    as from SCENIC) and a database of ligand and receptor pairings (such as from CellPhoneDB).
    This package creates an object storing ligand - receptor - transcription factor
    linkages by cluster and provides several methods for exploring, summarizing, and
    visualizing the analysis.
