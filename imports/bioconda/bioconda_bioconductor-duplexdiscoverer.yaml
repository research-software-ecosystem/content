about:
  description: DuplexDiscovereR is a package designed for analyzing data from RNA
    cross-linking and proximity ligation protocols such as SPLASH, PARIS, LIGR-seq,
    and others. DuplexDiscovereR accepts input in the form of chimerically or split-aligned
    reads. It includes procedures for alignment classification, filtering, and efficient
    clustering of individual chimeric reads into duplex groups (DGs). Once DGs are
    identified, the package predicts RNA duplex formation and their hybridization
    energies. Additional metrics, such as p-values for random ligation hypothesis
    or mean DG alignment scores, can be calculated to rank final set of RNA duplexes.
    Data from multiple experiments or replicates can be processed separately and further
    compared to check the reproducibility of the experimental method.
