  summary: In tumor tissue, underlying genomic instability can lead to DNA copy number
    alterations, e.g., copy number gains or losses. Sporadic copy number alterations
    occur randomly throughout the genome, whereas recurrent alterations are observed
    in the same genomic region across multiple independent samples, perhaps because
    they provide a selective growth advantage. Here we use cyclic shift permutations
    to identify recurrent copy number alterations in a single cohort or recurrent
    copy number differences in two cohorts based on a common set of genomic markers.
    Additional functionality is provided to perform downstream analyses, including
    the creation of summary files and graphics. DiNAMIC.Duo builds upon the original
    DiNAMIC package of Walter et al. (2011) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btq717> and
    leverages the theory developed in Walter et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asv046>.
    A manuscript based on DiNAMIC.Duo is currently under development.
