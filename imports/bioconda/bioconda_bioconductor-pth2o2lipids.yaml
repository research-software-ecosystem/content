about:
  description: 'Annotated HPLC-ESI-MS lipid data in positive ionization mode from
    an experiment in which cultures of the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum
    were treated with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to induce
    oxidative stress. The experiment is described in Graff van Creveld, et al., 2015,
    "Early perturbation in mitochondria redox homeostasis in response to environmental
    stress predicts cell fate in diatoms," ISME Journal 9:385-395. PtH2O2lipids consists
    of two objects: A CAMERA xsAnnotate object (ptH2O2lipids$xsAnnotate) and LOBSTAHS
    LOBSet object (ptH2O2lipids$xsAnnotate$LOBSet). The LOBSet includes putative compound
    assignments from the default LOBSTAHS database. Isomer annotation is recorded
    in three other LOBSet slots.'
