about:
  description: This package was derived from Rsymphony_0.1-17 from CRAN. These packages
    provide an R interface to SYMPHONY, an open-source linear programming solver written
    in C++. The main difference between this package and Rsymphony is that it includes
    the solver source code (SYMPHONY version 5.6), while Rsymphony expects to find
    header and library files on the users' system. Thus the intention of lpsymphony
    is to provide an easy to install interface to SYMPHONY. For Windows, precompiled
    DLLs are included in this package.
