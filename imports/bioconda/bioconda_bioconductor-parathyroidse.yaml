about:
  description: 'This package provides RangedSummarizedExperiment objects of read counts
    in genes and exonic parts for paired-end RNA-Seq data from experiments on primary
    cultures of parathyroid tumors.  The data were presented in the article "Evidence
    of a Functional Estrogen Receptor in Parathyroid Adenomas" by Haglund F, Ma R,
    Huss M, Sulaiman L, Lu M, Nilsson IL, Hoog A, Juhlin CC, Hartman J, Larsson C,
    J Clin Endocrinol Metab. jc.2012-2484, Epub 2012 Sep 28, PMID: 23024189.  The
    sequencing was performed on tumor cultures from 4 patients at 2 time points over
    3 conditions (DPN, OHT and control).  One control sample was omitted by the paper
    authors due to low quality. The package vignette describes the creation of the
    object from raw sequencing data provided by NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus under
    accession number GSE37211.  The gene and exon features are the GRCh37 Ensembl
    annotations.'
