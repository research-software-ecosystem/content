about:
  description: The SplicingFactory R package uses transcript-level expression values
    to analyze splicing diversity based on various statistical measures, like Shannon
    entropy or the Gini index. These measures can quantify transcript isoform diversity
    within samples or between conditions. Additionally, the package analyzes the isoform
    diversity data, looking for significant changes between conditions.
