about:
  description: TargetScan miRNA target predictions for mouse assembled using data
    from the TargetScan website. TargetScan predicts biological targets of miRNAs
    by searching for the presence of conserved 8mer and 7mer sites that match the
    seed region of each miRNA. Also identified are sites with mismatches in the seed
    region that are compensated by conserved 3' pairing. In mammals, predictions are
    ranked based on the predicted efficacy of targeting as calculated using the context
    scores of the sites.
