  summary: Starting with alignments of contigs to a reference genome, produce a chromosome-scale
    pseudoassembly by patching gaps between mapped contigs with sequences from the
    reference. Download the github repository for helper scripts to automate GPatch
    workflows, identify and correct misjoins in the contig assembly, produce dot-plots
    of patched pseudoassemblies to a reference assembly, and generate chrom.sizes
    and liftover chains for patched pseudoassemblies."
