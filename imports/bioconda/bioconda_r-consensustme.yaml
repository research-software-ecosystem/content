  summary: ConsensusTME is a consensus based approach to generating cancer specific
    gene sets for multiple cell types found within the tumour microenvironment. This
    package allows access to these genesets and provides a wrapper for using these
    gene sets with various statistical frameworks to generate normalised enrichment
    scores. These can be used to identify relative quantities of cell types across
    multiple samples.
