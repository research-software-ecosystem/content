about:
  description: ramr is an R package for detection of low-frequency aberrant methylation
    events in large data sets obtained by methylation profiling using array or high-throughput
    bisulfite sequencing. In addition, package provides functions to visualize found
    aberrantly methylated regions (AMRs), to generate sets of all possible regions
    to be used as reference sets for enrichment analysis, and to generate biologically
    relevant test data sets for performance evaluation of AMR/DMR search algorithms.
