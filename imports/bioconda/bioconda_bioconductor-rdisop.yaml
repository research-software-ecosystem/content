about:
  description: In high resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), the measured masses can
    be decomposed into potential element combinations (chemical sum formulas). Where
    additional mass/intensity information of respective isotopic peaks is available,
    decomposition can take this information into account to better rank the potential
    candidate sum formulas. To compare measured mass/intensity information with the
    theoretical distribution of candidate sum formulas, the latter needs to be calculated.
    This package implements fast algorithms to address both tasks, the calculation
    of isotopic distributions for arbitrary sum formulas (assuming a HR-MS resolution
    of roughly 30,000), and the ranked list of sum formulas fitting an observed peak
    or isotopic peak set.
