about:
  description: A curated dataset of Microarrays samples. The samples are MDI- induced
    pre-adipocytes (3T3-L1) at different time points/stage of differentiation under
    different types of genetic (knockdown/overexpression) and pharmacological (drug
    treatment) perturbations. The package documents the data collection and processing.
    In addition to the documentation, the package contains the scripts that was used
    to generated the data.
