about:
  description: iPath is the Bioconductor package used for calculating personalized
    pathway score and test the association with survival outcomes. Abundant single-gene
    biomarkers have been identified and used in the clinics. However, hundreds of
    oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes are involved during the process of tumorigenesis.
    We believe individual-level expression patterns of pre-defined pathways or gene
    sets are better biomarkers than single genes. In this study, we devised a computational
    method named iPath to identify prognostic biomarker pathways, one sample at a
    time. To test its utility, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis across 14 cancer
    types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and demonstrated that iPath is capable of identifying
    highly predictive biomarkers for clinical outcomes, including overall survival,
    tumor subtypes, and tumor stage classifications. We found that pathway-based biomarkers
    are more robust and effective than single genes.
