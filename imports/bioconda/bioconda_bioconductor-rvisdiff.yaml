about:
  description: 'Creates a muti-graph web page which allows the interactive exploration
    of differential expression results. The graphical web interface presents results
    as a table which is integrated with five interactive graphs: MA-plot, volcano
    plot, box plot, lines plot and cluster heatmap. Graphical aspect and information
    represented in the graphs can be customized by means of user controls. Final graphics
    can be exported as PNG format.'
