about:
  description: 'ProcessCurated is a toolkit for processing manually curated genome
    assemblies.

    It reconciles AGP files manually curated in PretextView to rename, reorient,

    and sort assemblies in preparation for submission. The tool performs three main

    operations: correcting and splitting AGP files while assigning unlocalized sequences,

    assigning chromosome names to scaffolds, and reorienting and renaming sequences

    based on MashMap alignment data.
