about:
  description: 'IsoBayes is a Bayesian method to perform inference on single protein
    isoforms. Our approach infers the presence/absence of protein isoforms, and also
    estimates their abundance; additionally, it provides a measure of the uncertainty
    of these estimates, via: i) the posterior probability that a protein isoform is
    present in the sample; ii) a posterior credible interval of its abundance. IsoBayes
    inputs liquid cromatography mass spectrometry (MS) data, and can work with both
    PSM counts, and intensities. When available, trascript isoform abundances (i.e.,
    TPMs) are also incorporated: TPMs are used to formulate an informative prior for
    the respective protein isoform relative abundance. We further identify isoforms
    where the relative abundance of proteins and transcripts significantly differ.
    We use a two-layer latent variable approach to model two sources of uncertainty
    typical of MS data: i) peptides may be erroneously detected (even when absent);
    ii) many peptides are compatible with multiple protein isoforms. In the first
    layer, we sample the presence/absence of each peptide based on its estimated probability
    of being mistakenly detected, also known as PEP (i.e., posterior error probability).
    In the second layer, for peptides that were estimated as being present, we allocate
    their abundance across the protein isoforms they map to. These two steps allow
    us to recover the presence and abundance of each protein isoform.'
