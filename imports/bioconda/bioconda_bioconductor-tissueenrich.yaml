about:
  description: "The TissueEnrich package is used to calculate enrichment of tissue-specific\
    \ genes in a set of input genes. For example, the user can input the most highly\
    \ expressed genes from RNA-Seq data, or gene co-expression modules to determine\
    \ which tissue-specific genes are enriched in those datasets. Tissue-specific\
    \ genes were defined by processing RNA-Seq data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA)\
    \ (Uhl\xE9n et al. 2015), GTEx (Ardlie et al. 2015), and mouse ENCODE (Shen et\
    \ al. 2012) using the algorithm from the HPA (Uhl\xE9n et al. 2015).The hypergeometric\
    \ test is being used to determine if the tissue-specific genes are enriched among\
    \ the input genes. Along with tissue-specific gene enrichment, the TissueEnrich\
    \ package can also be used to define tissue-specific genes from expression datasets\
    \ provided by the user, which can then be used to calculate tissue-specific gene\
    \ enrichments."
