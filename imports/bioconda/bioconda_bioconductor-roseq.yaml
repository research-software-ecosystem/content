about:
  description: ROSeq - A rank based approach to modeling gene expression with filtered
    and normalized read count matrix. ROSeq takes filtered and normalized read matrix
    and cell-annotation/condition as input and determines the differentially expressed
    genes between the contrasting groups of single cells. One of the input parameters
    is the number of cores to be used.
