  summary: TINC is a package that implements algorithms to determine the contamination
    of a bulk sequencing sample in the context of cancer studies (matched tumour/
    normal). The contamination estimated by TINC can be either due to normal cells
    sampled in the tumour biopsy or to tumour cells in the normal biopsy. The former
    case is traditionally called purity, or cellularity, and a number of tools exist
    to estimate it. The latter case is less common, and that is the main reason TINC
    has been developed. For this reason, the package takes name TINC, Tumour-in-Normal
    contamination. TINC is part of the evoverse, a package that gathers multiple R
    packages to implement Cancer Evolution analyses.
