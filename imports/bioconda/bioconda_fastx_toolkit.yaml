  summary: '''The FASTX-Toolkit is a collection of command line tools for

    Short-Reads FASTA/FASTQ files preprocessing.


    Next-Generation sequencing machines usually produce FASTA or FASTQ files,

    containing multiple short-reads sequences (possibly with quality

    information).


    The main processing of such FASTA/FASTQ files is mapping (aka aligning) the

    sequences to reference genomes or other databases using specialized

    programs. Example of such mapping programs are: Blat, SHRiMP, LastZ, MAQ

    and many many others


    However, it is sometimes more productive to preprocess the FASTA/FASTQ files

    before mapping the sequences to the genome - manipulating the sequences to

    produce better mapping results.


    The FASTX-Toolkit tools perform some of these preprocessing tasks.''
