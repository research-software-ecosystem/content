about:
  description: This package implements a suite of methods to preprocess data from
    PTR-TOF-MS instruments (HDF5 format) and generates the 'sample by features' table
    of peak intensities in addition to the sample and feature metadata (as a singl<e
    ExpressionSet object for subsequent statistical analysis). This package also permit
    usefull tools for cohorts management as analyzing data progressively, visualization
    tools and quality control. The steps include calibration, expiration detection,
    peak detection and quantification, feature alignment, missing value imputation
    and feature annotation. Applications to exhaled air and cell culture in headspace
    are described in the vignettes and examples. This package was used for data analysis
    of Gassin Delyle study on adults undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation in
    the intensive care unit due to severe COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 acute respiratory
    distress syndrome (ARDS), and permit to identfy four potentiel biomarquers of
    the infection.
