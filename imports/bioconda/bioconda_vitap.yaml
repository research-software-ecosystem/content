  description: Viral Taxonomic Assignment Pipeline (VITAP) is a cutting-edge tool
    designed to address the growing need for accurate and comprehensive taxonomic
    assignments of DNA and RNA viral sequences. By integrating alignment-based techniques
    with graph theory, VITAP achieves high precision in classifying viral sequences,
    including those as short as 1000 base pairs, down to the genus level.
