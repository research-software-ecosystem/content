about:
  description: An increasing number of microbiome datasets have been generated and
    analyzed with the help of rapidly developing sequencing technologies. At present,
    analysis of taxonomic profiling data is mainly conducted using composition-based
    methods, which ignores interactions between community members. Besides this, a
    lack of efficient ways to compare microbial interaction networks limited the study
    of community dynamics. To better understand how community diversity is affected
    by complex interactions between its members, we developed a framework (Microbial
    community dIversity and Network Analysis, mina), a comprehensive framework for
    microbial community diversity analysis and network comparison. By defining and
    integrating network-derived community features, we greatly reduce noise-to-signal
    ratio for diversity analyses. A bootstrap and permutation-based method was implemented
    to assess community network dissimilarities and extract discriminative features
    in a statistically principled way.
