  summary: 'An interface for the single-cell RNAseq-oriented loom format. Loom files
    are an HDF5-based

    format for storing and interacting with large single-cell RNAseq datasets. loomR

    provides an interface for working with loom files in a loom-specific way; we provide

    routines for validating loom files, iterating with chunks through data within
    the

    loom file, and provide a platform for other packages to build support for loom
    files.
