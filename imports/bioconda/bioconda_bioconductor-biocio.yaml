about:
  description: The `BiocIO` package contains high-level abstract classes and generics
    used by developers to build IO funcionality within the Bioconductor suite of packages.
    Implements `import()` and `export()` standard generics for importing and exporting
    biological data formats. `import()` supports whole-file as well as chunk-wise
    iterative import. The `import()` interface optionally provides a standard mechanism
    for 'lazy' access via `filter()` (on row or element-like components of the file
    resource), `select()` (on column-like components of the file resource) and `collect()`.
    The `import()` interface optionally provides transparent access to remote (e.g.
    via https) as well as local access. Developers can register a file extension,
    e.g., `.loom` for dispatch from character-based URIs to specific `import()` /
    `export()` methods based on classes representing file types, e.g., `LoomFile()`.
