about:
  description: HGC (short for Hierarchical Graph-based Clustering) is an R package
    for conducting hierarchical clustering on large-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq)
    data. The key idea is to construct a dendrogram of cells on their shared nearest
    neighbor (SNN) graph. HGC provides functions for building graphs and for conducting
    hierarchical clustering on the graph. The users with old R version could visit
    https://github.com/XuegongLab/HGC/tree/HGC4oldRVersion to get HGC package built
    for R 3.6.
