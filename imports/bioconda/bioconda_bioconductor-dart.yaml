about:
  description: Denoising Algorithm based on Relevance network Topology (DART) is an
    algorithm designed to evaluate the consistency of prior information molecular
    signatures (e.g in-vitro perturbation expression signatures) in independent molecular
    data (e.g gene expression data sets). If consistent, a pruning network strategy
    is then used to infer the activation status of the molecular signature in individual
    samples.
