about:
  description: RNAeditr analyzes site-specific RNA editing events, as well as hyper-editing
    regions. The editing frequencies can be tested against binary, continuous or survival
    outcomes. Multiple covariate variables as well as interaction effects can also
    be incorporated in the statistical models.
