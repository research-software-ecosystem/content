about:
  description: This package provides a roclet for roxygen2 that identifies and processes
    code blocks in your documentation marked with `@longtests`. These blocks should
    contain tests that take a long time to run and thus cannot be included in the
    regular test suite of the package. When you run `roxygen2::roxygenise` with the
    `longtests_roclet`, it will extract these long tests from your documentation and
    save them in a separate directory. This allows you to run these long tests separately
    from the rest of your tests, for example, on a continuous integration server that
    is set up to run long tests.
