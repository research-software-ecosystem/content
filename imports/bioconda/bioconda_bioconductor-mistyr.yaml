about:
  description: mistyR is an implementation of the Multiview Intercellular SpaTialmodeling
    framework (MISTy). MISTy is an explainable machine learning framework for knowledge
    extraction and analysis of single-cell, highly multiplexed, spatially resolved
    data. MISTy facilitates an in-depth understanding of marker interactions by profiling
    the intra- and intercellular relationships. MISTy is a flexible framework able
    to process a custom number of views. Each of these views can describe a different
    spatial context, i.e., define a relationship among the observed expressions of
    the markers, such as intracellular regulation or paracrine regulation, but also,
    the views can also capture cell-type specific relationships, capture relations
    between functional footprints or focus on relations between different anatomical
    regions. Each MISTy view is considered as a potential source of variability in
    the measured marker expressions. Each MISTy view is then analyzed for its contribution
    to the total expression of each marker and is explained in terms of the interactions
    with other measurements that led to the observed contribution.
