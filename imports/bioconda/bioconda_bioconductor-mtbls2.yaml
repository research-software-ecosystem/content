about:
  description: Indole-3-acetaldoxime (IAOx) represents an early intermediate of the
    biosynthesis of a variety of indolic secondary metabolites including the phytoanticipin
    indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate and the phytoalexin camalexin (3-thiazol-2'-yl-indole).
    Arabidopsis thaliana cyp79B2 cyp79B3 double knockout plants are completely impaired
    in the conversion of tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime and do not accumulate
    IAOx-derived metabolites any longer. Consequently, comparative analysis of wild-type
    and cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plant lines has the potential to explore the complete range
    of IAOx-derived indolic secondary metabolites.
