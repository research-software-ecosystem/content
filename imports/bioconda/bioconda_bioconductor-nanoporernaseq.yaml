about:
  description: The NanoporeRNASeq package contains long read RNA-Seq data generated
    using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing. The data consists of 6 samples from two human
    cell lines (K562 and MCF7) that were generated by the SG-NEx project. Each of
    these cell lines has three replicates, with 1 direct RNA sequencing data and 2
    cDNA sequencing data. Reads are aligned to chromosome 22 (Grch38) and stored as
    bam files. The original data is from the SG-NEx project.
