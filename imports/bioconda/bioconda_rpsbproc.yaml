  description: 'The rpsbproc command line utility is an addition to the standalone
    version of

    Reverse Position-Specific BLAST (RPS-BLAST), also known as CD-Search (Conserved

    Domain Search).


    It post-processes the results of local RPS-BLAST searches in order to provide
    a

    non-redundant view of the search results, and to provide additional annotation

    on query sequences, such as domain superfamilies and functional sites, similar
    to

    the annotation provided by the corresponding web services (e.g., the NCBI Batch

    CD-Search web service at

    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/bwrpsb/bwrpsb.cgi).


    Specifically, the rpsbproc utility reads the output of rpsblast/rpstblastn,

    fills in domain superfamily and functional site information for each region of

    the sequence, re-sorts the hits by a different standard, and calculates a

    set of non-redundent representative hits. In this way, it turns the

    raw alignments into domain/site annotations on the query sequence at different

    redundancy level, basically produce the same data as web-based Batch CD-Search

    service does. The annotation data is presented in tab-delimited tables to be processed

    either programatically or manually with a spreadsheet (see details below).


    See the CDD and CD-Search help document for additional details about

    superfamilies, conserved sites, and more:
