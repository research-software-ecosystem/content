  description: 'GARFIELD is a non-parametric functional enrichment analysis approach
    described in the paper GARFIELD: GWAS analysis of regulatory or functional information
    enrichment with LD correction. Briefly, it is a method that leverages GWAS findings
    with regulatory or functional annotations (primarily from ENCODE and Roadmap epigenomics
    data) to find features relevant to a phenotype of interest. It performs greedy
    pruning of GWAS SNPs (LD r2 > 0.1) and then annotates them based on functional
    information overlap. Next, it quantifies Fold Enrichment (FE) at various GWAS
    significance cutoffs and assesses them by permutation testing, while matching
    for minor allele frequency, distance to nearest transcription start site and number
    of LD proxies (r2 > 0.8).'
