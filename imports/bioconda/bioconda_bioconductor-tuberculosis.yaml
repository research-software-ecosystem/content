about:
  description: The tuberculosis R/Bioconductor package features tuberculosis gene
    expression data for machine learning. All human samples from GEO that did not
    come from cell lines, were not taken postmortem, and did not feature recombination
    have been included. The package has more than 10,000 samples from both microarray
    and sequencing studies that have been processed from raw data through a hyper-standardized,
    reproducible pipeline.
