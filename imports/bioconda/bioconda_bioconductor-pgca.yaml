about:
  description: Protein Group Code Algorithm (PGCA) is a computationally inexpensive
    algorithm to merge protein summaries from multiple experimental quantitative proteomics
    data. The algorithm connects two or more groups with overlapping accession numbers.
    In some cases, pairwise groups are mutually exclusive but they may still be connected
    by another group (or set of groups) with overlapping accession numbers. Thus,
    groups created by PGCA from multiple experimental runs (i.e., global groups) are
    called "connected" groups. These identified global protein groups enable the analysis
    of quantitative data available for protein groups instead of unique protein identifiers.
