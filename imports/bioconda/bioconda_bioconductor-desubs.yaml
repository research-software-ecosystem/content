about:
  description: DEsubs is a network-based systems biology package that extracts disease-perturbed
    subpathways within a pathway network as recorded by RNA-seq experiments. It contains
    an extensive and customizable framework covering a broad range of operation modes
    at all stages of the subpathway analysis, enabling a case-specific approach. The
    operation modes refer to the pathway network construction and processing, the
    subpathway extraction, visualization and enrichment analysis with regard to various
    biological and pharmacological features. Its capabilities render it a tool-guide
    for both the modeler and experimentalist for the identification of more robust
    systems-level biomarkers for complex diseases.
