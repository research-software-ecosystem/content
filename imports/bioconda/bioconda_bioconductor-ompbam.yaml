about:
  description: This packages provides C++ header files for developers wishing to create
    R packages that processes BAM files. ompBAM automates file access, memory management,
    and handling of multiple threads 'behind the scenes', so developers can focus
    on creating domain-specific functionality. The included vignette contains detailed
    documentation of this API, including quick-start instructions to create a new
    ompBAM-based package, and step-by-step explanation of the functionality behind
    the example packaged included within ompBAM.
