  summary: IMa3 can be used to solve a fundamental problem in evolutionary genetics,
    which is to jointly consider phylogenetic history and pouplation genetic history,
    including gene exchange. IMa3 can be used to estimate the rooted phylogenetic
    tree for multiple populations, and does so while integrating over all possible
    Isolation-with-Migration models
