about:
  description: Correspondence analysis (CA) is a matrix factorization method, and
    is similar to principal components analysis (PCA). Whereas PCA is designed for
    application to continuous, approximately normally distributed data, CA is appropriate
    for non-negative, count-based data that are in the same additive scale. The corral
    package implements CA for dimensionality reduction of a single matrix of single-cell
    data, as well as a multi-table adaptation of CA that leverages data-optimized
    scaling to align data generated from different sequencing platforms by projecting
    into a shared latent space. corral utilizes sparse matrices and a fast implementation
    of SVD, and can be called directly on Bioconductor objects (e.g., SingleCellExperiment)
    for easy pipeline integration. The package also includes additional options, including
    variations of CA to address overdispersion in count data (e.g., Freeman-Tukey
    chi-squared residual), as well as the option to apply CA-style processing to continuous
    data (e.g., proteomic TOF intensities) with the Hellinger distance adaptation
    of CA.
