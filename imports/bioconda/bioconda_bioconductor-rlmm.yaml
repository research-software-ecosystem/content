  description: 'A classification algorithm, based on a multi-chip, multi-SNP approach
    for Affymetrix SNP arrays. Using a large training sample where the genotype labels
    are known, this aglorithm will obtain more accurate classification results on
    new data. RLMM is based on a robust, linear model and uses the Mahalanobis distance
    for classification. The chip-to-chip non-biological variation is removed through
    normalization. This model-based algorithm captures the similarities across genotype
    groups and probes, as well as thousands other SNPs for accurate classification.
    NOTE: 100K-Xba only at for now.'
