about:
  description: Use multiple factor analysis to calculate individualized pathway-centric
    scores of deviation with respect to the sampled population based on multi-omic
    assays (e.g., RNA-seq, copy number alterations, methylation, etc). Graphical and
    numerical outputs are provided to identify highly aberrant individuals for a particular
    pathway of interest, as well as the gene and omics drivers of aberrant multi-omic
    profiles.
