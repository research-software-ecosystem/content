about:
  description: Based on the standard DataFrame metaphor, we are trying to implement
    the feature of delayed operation on the DelayedDataFrame, with a slot of lazyIndex,
    which saves the mapping indexes for each column of DelayedDataFrame. Methods like
    show, validity check, [/[[ subsetting, rbind/cbind are implemented for DelayedDataFrame
    to be operated around lazyIndex. The listData slot stays untouched until a realization
    call e.g., DataFrame constructor OR as.list() is invoked.
