about:
  description: It has been shown that both DNA methylation and RNA transcription are
    linked to chronological age and age related diseases. Several estimators have
    been developed to predict human aging from DNA level and RNA level. Most of the
    human transcriptional age predictor are based on microarray data and limited to
    only a few tissues. To date, transcriptional studies on aging using RNASeq data
    from different human tissues is limited. The aim of this package is to provide
    a tool for across-tissue and tissue-specific transcriptional age calculation based
    on GTEx RNASeq data.
