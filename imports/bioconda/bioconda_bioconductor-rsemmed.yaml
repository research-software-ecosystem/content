about:
  description: A programmatic interface to the Semantic MEDLINE database. It provides
    functions for searching the database for concepts and finding paths between concepts.
    Path searching can also be tailored to user specifications, such as placing restrictions
    on concept types and the type of link between concepts. It also provides functions
    for summarizing and visualizing those paths.
