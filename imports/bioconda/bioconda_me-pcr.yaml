  description: 'Multithreaded Electronic PCR (me-PCR) was developed by Kevin Murphy
    at

    Children''s Hospital of Philadelphia. It is described in Murphy et al

    (2004) https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btg466 and was originally

    available from http://genome.chop.edu/mePCR (defunct). It was based on the

    public domain NCBI tool e-PCR by Gregory D. Schuler, described in Schuler

    (1997) https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.7.5.541 which was origially availble

    from ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/schuler/e-PCR/ (defunct). The final

    release of me-PCR was v1.0.6 (2008-02-18), and the author wrote that in

    general NCBI e-PCR should be used instead having been improved greatly

    over the years. The NCBI retired and withdrew the e-PCR webservice and

    command line tool on 2017-06-28, suggesting the online-only tool

    Primer-BLAST instead. However, this is not suitable for offline high

    throughput usage. See also Jim Kent''s isPCR (aslo available in BioConda).
