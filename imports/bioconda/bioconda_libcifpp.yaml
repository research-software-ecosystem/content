about:
  description: 'This library, libcifpp, is a generic CIF library with some specific
    additions to work with mmCIF files.

    The main focus of this library is to make sure that files read or written are
    valid.

    That is, they are syntactically valid and their content is valid with respect
    to a CIF dictionary, if such a dictionary is available and specified.
