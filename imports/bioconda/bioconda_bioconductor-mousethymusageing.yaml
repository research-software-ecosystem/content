about:
  description: This package provides data access to counts matrices and meta-data
    for single-cell RNA sequencing data of thymic epithlial cells across mouse ageing
    using SMARTseq2 and 10X Genommics chemistries. Access is provided as a data package
    via ExperimentHub. It is designed to facilitate the re-use of data from Baran-Gale
    _et al._ in a consistent format that includes relevant and informative meta-data.
