  description: Determining the sample size for adequate power to detect statistical
    significance is a crucial step at the design stage for high-throughput experiments.
    Even though a number of methods and tools are available for sample size calculation
    for microarray and RNA-seq in the context of differential expression (DE), this
    topic in the field of single-cell RNA sequencing is understudied. Moreover, the
    unique data characteristics present in scRNA-seq such as sparsity and heterogeneity
    increase the challenge. We propose POWSC, a simulation-based method, to provide
    power evaluation and sample size recommendation for single-cell RNA sequencing
    DE analysis. POWSC consists of a data simulator that creates realistic expression
    data, and a power assessor that provides a comprehensive evaluation and visualization
    of the power and sample size relationship.
