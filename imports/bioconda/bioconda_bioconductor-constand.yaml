about:
  description: Normalizes a data matrix `data` by raking (using the RAS method by
    Bacharach, see references) the Nrows by Ncols matrix such that the row means and
    column means equal 1. The result is a normalized data matrix `K=RAS`, a product
    of row mulipliers `R` and column multipliers `S` with the original matrix `A`.
    Missing information needs to be presented as `NA` values and not as zero values,
    because CONSTANd is able to ignore missing values when calculating the mean. Using
    CONSTANd normalization allows for the direct comparison of values between samples
    within the same and even across different CONSTANd-normalized data matrices.
