about:
  description: Provides delayed computation of a matrix of residuals after fitting
    a linear model to each column of an input matrix. Also supports partial computation
    of residuals where selected factors are to be preserved in the output matrix.
    Implements a number of efficient methods for operating on the delayed matrix of
    residuals, most notably matrix multiplication and calculation of row/column sums
    or means.
