  description: We presented the Genotype-imputed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GIGSEA),
    a novel method that uses GWAS-and-eQTL-imputed trait-associated differential gene
    expression to interrogate gene set enrichment for the trait-associated SNPs. By
    incorporating eQTL from large gene expression studies, e.g. GTEx, GIGSEA appropriately
    addresses such challenges for SNP enrichment as gene size, gene boundary, SNP
    distal regulation, and multiple-marker regulation. The weighted linear regression
    model, taking as weights both imputation accuracy and model completeness, was
    used to perform the enrichment test, properly adjusting the bias due to redundancy
    in different gene sets. The permutation test, furthermore, is used to evaluate
    the significance of enrichment, whose efficiency can be largely elevated by expressing
    the computational intensive part in terms of large matrix operation. We have shown
    the appropriate type I error rates for GIGSEA (<5%), and the preliminary results
    also demonstrate its good performance to uncover the real signal.
