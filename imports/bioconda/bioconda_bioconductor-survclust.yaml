about:
  description: survClust is an outcome weighted integrative clustering algorithm used
    to classify multi-omic samples on their available time to event information. The
    resulting clusters are cross-validated to avoid over overfitting and output classification
    of samples that are molecularly distinct and clinically meaningful. It takes in
    binary (mutation) as well as continuous data (other omic types).
