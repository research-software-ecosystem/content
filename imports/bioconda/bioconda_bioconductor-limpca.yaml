about:
  description: This package has for objectives to provide a method to make Linear
    Models for high-dimensional designed data. limpca applies a GLM (General Linear
    Model) version of ASCA and APCA to analyse multivariate sample profiles generated
    by an experimental design. ASCA/APCA provide powerful visualization tools for
    multivariate structures in the space of each effect of the statistical model linked
    to the experimental design and contrarily to MANOVA, it can deal with mutlivariate
    datasets having more variables than observations. This method can handle unbalanced
    design.
