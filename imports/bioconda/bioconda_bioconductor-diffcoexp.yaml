about:
  description: A tool for the identification of differentially coexpressed links (DCLs)
    and differentially coexpressed genes (DCGs). DCLs are gene pairs with significantly
    different correlation coefficients under two conditions. DCGs are genes with significantly
    more DCLs than by chance.
