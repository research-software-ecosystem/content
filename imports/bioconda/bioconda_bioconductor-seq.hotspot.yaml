about:
  description: seq.hotSPOT provides a resource for designing effective sequencing
    panels to help improve mutation capture efficacy for ultradeep sequencing projects.
    Using SNV datasets, this package designs custom panels for any tissue of interest
    and identify the genomic regions likely to contain the most mutations. Establishing
    efficient targeted sequencing panels can allow researchers to study mutation burden
    in tissues at high depth without the economic burden of whole-exome or whole-genome
    sequencing. This tool was developed to make high-depth sequencing panels to study
    low-frequency clonal mutations in clinically normal and cancerous tissues.
