about:
  description: GOdMD is a new method for determining pathways for conformational transitions
    in macromolecules based on the use of discrete molecular dynamics and biasing
    techniques based on a combination of essential dynamics and Maxwell-Demon sampling
    techniques. The method can work with high efficiency at different levels of resolution,
    including the atomistic one, and can help to define initial pathways for further
    exploration by means of more accurate atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
