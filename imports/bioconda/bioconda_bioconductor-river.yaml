about:
  description: An implementation of a probabilistic modeling framework that jointly
    analyzes personal genome and transcriptome data to estimate the probability that
    a variant has regulatory impact in that individual. It is based on a generative
    model that assumes that genomic annotations, such as the location of a variant
    with respect to regulatory elements, determine the prior probability that variant
    is a functional regulatory variant, which is an unobserved variable. The functional
    regulatory variant status then influences whether nearby genes are likely to display
    outlier levels of gene expression in that person. See the RIVER website for more
    information, documentation and examples.
