about:
  description: MetaboCoreUtils defines metabolomics-related core functionality provided
    as low-level functions to allow a data structure-independent usage across various
    R packages. This includes functions to calculate between ion (adduct) and compound
    mass-to-charge ratios and masses or functions to work with chemical formulas.
    The package provides also a set of adduct definitions and information on some
    commercially available internal standard mixes commonly used in MS experiments.
