about:
  description: 'FragPipe is a Java Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a suite of computational
    tools

    enabling comprehensive analysis of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.

    It is powered by MSFragger - an ultrafast proteomic search engine suitable

    for both conventional and "open" (wide precursor mass tolerance) peptide identification.

    FragPipe includes the Philosopher toolkit for downstream post-processing of

    MSFragger search results (PeptideProphet, iProphet, ProteinProphet), FDR filtering,

    label-based quantification, and multi-experiment summary report generation.

    Crystal-C and PTM-Shepherd are included to aid interpretation of open search results.

    Also included in FragPipe binary are TMT-Integrator for TMT/iTRAQ isobaric

    labeling-based quantification, IonQuant for label-free quantification with

    match-between-run (MBR) functionality, spectral library building with EasyPQP,

    and MSFragger-DIA and DIA-Umpire SE modules for direct analysis of data independent

    acquisition (DIA) data.
