about:
  description: The package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence (amino
    acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form a dimer or more likely
    to form a trimer. Additionally to the prediction itself, a prediction profile
    is computed which allows for determining the strengths to which the individual
    residues are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles can also be visualized
    as curves or heatmaps.
