about:
  description: 'MapScape integrates clonal prevalence, clonal hierarchy, anatomic
    and mutational information to provide interactive visualization of spatial clonal
    evolution. There are four inputs to MapScape: (i) the clonal phylogeny, (ii) clonal
    prevalences, (iii) an image reference, which may be a medical image or drawing
    and (iv) pixel locations for each sample on the referenced image. Optionally,
    MapScape can accept a data table of mutations for each clone and their variant
    allele frequencies in each sample. The output of MapScape consists of a cropped
    anatomical image surrounded by two representations of each tumour sample. The
    first, a cellular aggregate, visually displays the prevalence of each clone. The
    second shows a skeleton of the clonal phylogeny while highlighting only those
    clones present in the sample. Together, these representations enable the analyst
    to visualize the distribution of clones throughout anatomic space.'
