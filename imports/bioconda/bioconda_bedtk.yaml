about:
  description: 'Bedtk is a set of simple tools to process BED files. It so far implements
    intersection, subtraction, sorting, merging and computing the breadth of coverage.
    Bedtk is not as versatile as bedtools and never aims to match the bedtools feature
    set. It instead focuses on performance. Bedtk is several to tens of times faster
    and uses a fraction of memory. It also provides a few convenient functions. For
    example, sorting, merging and intersection can be done in one go without Unix
    pipes.
