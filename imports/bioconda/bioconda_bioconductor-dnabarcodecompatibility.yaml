about:
  description: The package allows one to obtain optimised combinations of DNA barcodes
    to be used for multiplex sequencing. In each barcode combination, barcodes are
    pooled with respect to Illumina chemistry constraints. Combinations can be filtered
    to keep those that are robust against substitution and insertion/deletion errors
    thereby facilitating the demultiplexing step. In addition, the package provides
    an optimiser function to further favor the selection of barcode combinations with
    least heterogeneity in barcode usage.
