about:
  description: This package is used to detect combination of genomic coordinates falling
    within a user defined window size along with user defined overlap between identified
    neighboring clusters. It can be used for genomic data where the clusters are built
    on a specific chromosome or specific strand. Clustering can be performed with
    a "greedy" option allowing thus the presence of additional sites within the allowed
    window size.
