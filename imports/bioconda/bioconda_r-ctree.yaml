about:
  description: "The ctree package implements clones trees for cancer evolutionary\
    \ studies. \nThese models are built from Cancer Cell Franctions (CCFs) clusters\
    \ computed via \ntumour subclonal deconvolution, using either one or more tumour\
    \ biopsies at once. \nThey can be used to model evolutionary trajectories from\
    \ bulk sequencing data, \nespecially if whole-genome sequencing is available.\
    \ The package implements S3 \nobjects for the mutation trees, as well as a Monte\
    \ Carlo sampler to generate them, \nas well as functions to plot and analyze the\
    \ trees. The sibling of a clone tree is \na mutation tree, which is built from\
    \ binary mutation profiles; refer to the mtree \npackage for mutation trees.\n"
