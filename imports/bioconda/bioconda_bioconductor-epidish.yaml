about:
  description: EpiDISH is a R package to infer the proportions of a priori known cell-types
    present in a sample representing a mixture of such cell-types. Right now, the
    package can be used on DNAm data of whole blood, generic epithelial tissue and
    breast tissue. Besides, the package provides a function that allows the identification
    of differentially methylated cell-types and their directionality of change in
    Epigenome-Wide Association Studies.
