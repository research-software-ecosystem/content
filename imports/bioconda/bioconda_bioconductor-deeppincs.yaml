  description: The identification of novel compound-protein interaction (CPI) is important
    in drug discovery. Revealing unknown compound-protein interactions is useful to
    design a new drug for a target protein by screening candidate compounds. The accurate
    CPI prediction assists in effective drug discovery process. To identify potential
    CPI effectively, prediction methods based on machine learning and deep learning
    have been developed. Data for sequences are provided as discrete symbolic data.
    In the data, compounds are represented as SMILES (simplified molecular-input line-entry
    system) strings and proteins are sequences in which the characters are amino acids.
    The outcome is defined as a variable that indicates how strong two molecules interact
    with each other or whether there is an interaction between them. In this package,
    a deep-learning based model that takes only sequence information of both compounds
    and proteins as input and the outcome as output is used to predict CPI. The model
    is implemented by using compound and protein encoders with useful features. The
    CPI model also supports other modeling tasks, including protein-protein interaction
    (PPI), chemical-chemical interaction (CCI), or single compounds and proteins.
    Although the model is designed for proteins, DNA and RNA can be used if they are
    represented as sequences.
