about:
  description: This package allows to estimate missing values in DNA methylation data.
    methyLImp method is based on linear regression since methylation levels show a
    high degree of inter-sample correlation. Implementation is parallelised over chromosomes
    since probes on different chromosomes are usually independent. Mini-batch approach
    to reduce the runtime in case of large number of samples is available.
