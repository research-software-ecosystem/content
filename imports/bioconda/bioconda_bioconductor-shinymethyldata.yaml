  description: Extracted data from 369 TCGA Head and Neck Cancer DNA methylation samples.
    The extracted data serve as an example dataset for the package shinyMethyl. Original
    samples are from 450k methylation arrays, and were obtained from The Cancer Genome
    Atlas (TCGA). 310 samples are from tumor, 50 are matched normals and 9 are technical
    replicates of a control cell line.
