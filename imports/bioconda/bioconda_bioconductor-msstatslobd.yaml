about:
  description: The MSstatsLOBD package allows calculation and visualization of limit
    of blac (LOB) and limit of detection (LOD). We define the LOB as the highest apparent
    concentration of a peptide expected when replicates of a blank sample containing
    no peptides are measured. The LOD is defined as the measured concentration value
    for which the probability of falsely claiming the absence of a peptide in the
    sample is 0.05, given a probability 0.05 of falsely claiming its presence. These
    functionalities were previously a part of the MSstats package. The methodology
    is described in Galitzine (2018) <doi:10.1074/mcp.RA117.000322>.
