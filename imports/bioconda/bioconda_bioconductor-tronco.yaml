about:
  description: The TRONCO (TRanslational ONCOlogy) R package collects algorithms to
    infer progression models via the approach of Suppes-Bayes Causal Network, both
    from an ensemble of tumors (cross-sectional samples) and within an individual
    patient (multi-region or single-cell samples). The package provides parallel implementation
    of algorithms that process binary matrices where each row represents a tumor sample
    and each column a single-nucleotide or a structural variant driving the progression;
    a 0/1 value models the absence/presence of that alteration in the sample. The
    tool can import data from plain, MAF or GISTIC format files, and can fetch it
    from the cBioPortal for cancer genomics. Functions for data manipulation and visualization
    are provided, as well as functions to import/export such data to other bioinformatics
    tools for, e.g, clustering or detection of mutually exclusive alterations. Inferred
    models can be visualized and tested for their confidence via bootstrap and cross-validation.
    TRONCO is used for the implementation of the Pipeline for Cancer Inference (PICNIC).
