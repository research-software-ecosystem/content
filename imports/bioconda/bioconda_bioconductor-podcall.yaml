about:
  description: Reads files exported from 'QX Manager or QuantaSoft' containing amplitude
    values from a run of ddPCR (96 well plate) and robustly sets thresholds to determine
    positive droplets for each channel of each individual well. Concentration and
    normalized concentration in addition to other metrics is then calculated for each
    well. Results are returned as a table, optionally written to file, as well as
    optional plots (scatterplot and histogram) for both channels per well written
    to file. The package includes a shiny application which provides an interactive
    and user-friendly interface to the full functionality of PoDCall.
