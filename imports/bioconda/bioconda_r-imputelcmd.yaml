  summary: 'The package contains a collection of functions for left-censored missing
    data imputation. Left-censoring is a special case of missing not at random (MNAR)  mechanism
    that generates non-responses in proteomics experiments. The package also contains
    functions to artificially generate peptide/protein expression data (log-transformed)
    as random draws from a multivariate Gaussian distribution as well as a function
    to generate missing data (both randomly and non-randomly). For comparison reasons,
    the package also contains several wrapper functions for the imputation of non-responses
    that are missing at random. * New functionality has been added: a hybrid method
    that allows the imputation of missing values in a more complex scenario where
    the missing data are both MAR and MNAR.'
