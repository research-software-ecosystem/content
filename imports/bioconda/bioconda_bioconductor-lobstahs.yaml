about:
  description: LOBSTAHS is a multifunction package for screening, annotation, and
    putative identification of mass spectral features in large, HPLC-MS lipid datasets.
    In silico data for a wide range of lipids, oxidized lipids, and oxylipins can
    be generated from user-supplied structural criteria with a database generation
    function. LOBSTAHS then applies these databases to assign putative compound identities
    to features in any high-mass accuracy dataset that has been processed using xcms
    and CAMERA. Users can then apply a series of orthogonal screening criteria based
    on adduct ion formation patterns, chromatographic retention time, and other properties,
    to evaluate and assign confidence scores to this list of preliminary assignments.
    During the screening routine, LOBSTAHS rejects assignments that do not meet the
    specified criteria, identifies potential isomers and isobars, and assigns a variety
    of annotation codes to assist the user in evaluating the accuracy of each assignment.
