about:
  description: MEM, Marker Enrichment Modeling, automatically generates and displays
    quantitative labels for cell populations that have been identified from single-cell
    data. The input for MEM is a dataset that has pre-clustered or pre-gated populations
    with cells in rows and features in columns. Labels convey a list of measured features
    and the features' levels of relative enrichment on each population. MEM can be
    applied to a wide variety of data types and can compare between MEM labels from
    flow cytometry, mass cytometry, single cell RNA-seq, and spectral flow cytometry
    using RMSD.
