  description: 'An R package for integrated differential expression and differential
    network analysis based on omic data for cancer biomarker discovery. Both correlation
    and partial correlation can be used to generate differential network to aid the
    traditional differential expression analysis to identify changes between biomolecules
    on both their expression and pairwise association levels. A detailed description
    of the methodology has been published in Methods journal (PMID: 27592383). An
    interactive visualization feature allows for the exploration and selection of
    candidate biomarkers.'
