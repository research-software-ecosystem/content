about:
  description: "WEPP (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology using Phylogenetic Placements)\
    \ is a pathogen-agnostic pipeline that enhances wastewater surveillance by leveraging\
    \ the pathogen's full phylogeny. It reports haplotype and lineage abundances,\
    \ maps reads parsimoniously to selected haplotypes, and flags Unaccounted Alleles\
    \ \u2014 those observed in the sample but unexplained by selected haplotypes,\
    \ potentially indicating novel variants.\nWEPP performs parsimonious read placement\
    \ on the mutation-annotated tree (MAT) to select a subset of haplotypes and adds\
    \ their neighbors to form an initial candidate pool, which is passed to a deconvolution\
    \ algorithm to estimate their relative abundances. An interactive dashboard enables\
    \ visualization of haplotypes in the global phylogenetic tree and read-level analysis."
