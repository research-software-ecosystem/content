about:
  description: PIPETS provides statistically robust analysis for 3'-seq/term-seq data.
    It utilizes a sliding window approach to apply a Poisson Distribution test to
    identify genomic positions with termination read coverage that is significantly
    higher than the surrounding signal. PIPETS then condenses proximal signal and
    produces strand specific results that contain all significant termination peaks.
