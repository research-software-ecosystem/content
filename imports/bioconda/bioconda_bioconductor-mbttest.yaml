about:
  description: MBttest method was developed from beta t-test method of Baggerly et
    al(2003). Compared to baySeq (Hard castle and Kelly 2010), DESeq (Anders and Huber
    2010) and exact test (Robinson and Smyth 2007, 2008) and the GLM of McCarthy et
    al(2012), MBttest is of high work efficiency,that is, it has high power, high
    conservativeness of FDR estimation and high stability. MBttest is suit- able to
    transcriptomic data, tag data, SAGE data (count data) from small samples or a
    few replicate libraries. It can be used to identify genes, mRNA isoforms or tags
    differentially expressed between two conditions.
