about:
  description: 'This is a fork of MrBayes v3.2.7a, a programme for estimation of phylogenetic
    trees using

    Bayesian inference. This fork differs from the original in that the standard character

    coding is no longer intended for morphology in biological datasets but rather
    for the encoding

    of plainchant melodies in the volpiano format. The original README is provided
    below as well

    as the license and modified source code. A note has been added to the greeting
    text to make it

    clear that this is a fork only intended to be used for analysing plainchant melodies
    in volpiano

    format rather than the original biological sequence data.
