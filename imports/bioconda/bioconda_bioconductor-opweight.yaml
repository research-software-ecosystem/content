about:
  description: This package perform weighted-pvalue based multiple hypothesis test
    and provides corresponding information such as ranking probability, weight, significant
    tests, etc . To conduct this testing procedure, the testing method apply a probabilistic
    relationship between the test rank and the corresponding test effect size.
