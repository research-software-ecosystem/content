about:
  description: This package offers a robust approach to make inference on the association
    of covariates with the absolute abundance (AA) of microbiome in an ecosystem.
    It can be also directly applied to relative abundance (RA) data to make inference
    on AA because the ratio of two RA is equal to the ratio of their AA. This algorithm
    can estimate and test the associations of interest while adjusting for potential
    confounders. The estimates of this method have easy interpretation like a typical
    regression analysis. High-dimensional covariates are handled with regularization
    and it is implemented by parallel computing. False discovery rate is automatically
    controlled by this approach. Zeros do not need to be imputed by a positive value
    for the analysis. The IFAA package also offers the 'MZILN' function for estimating
    and testing associations of abundance ratios with covariates.
