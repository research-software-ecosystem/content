  description: Reconstructing gene regulatory networks and transcription factor activity
    is crucial to understand biological processes and holds potential for developing
    personalized treatment. Yet, it is still an open problem as state-of-art algorithm
    are often not able to handle large amounts of data. Furthermore, many of the present
    methods predict numerous false positives and are unable to integrate other sources
    of information such as previously known interactions. Here we introduce KBoost,
    an algorithm that uses kernel PCA regression, boosting and Bayesian model averaging
    for fast and accurate reconstruction of gene regulatory networks. KBoost can also
    use a prior network built on previously known transcription factor targets. We
    have benchmarked KBoost using three different datasets against other high performing
    algorithms. The results show that our method compares favourably to other methods
    across datasets.
