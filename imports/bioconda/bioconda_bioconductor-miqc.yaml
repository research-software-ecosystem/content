  description: "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to profile\
    \ gene expression in tissues at high resolution.  An important preprocessing step\
    \ prior to performing downstream analyses is to identify and remove cells with\
    \ poor or degraded sample quality using quality control (QC) metrics.  Two widely\
    \ used QC metrics to identify a \u2018low-quality\u2019 cell are (i) if the cell\
    \ includes a high proportion of reads that map to mitochondrial DNA encoded genes\
    \ (mtDNA) and (ii) if a small number of genes are detected. miQC is data-driven\
    \ QC metric that jointly models both the proportion of reads mapping to mtDNA\
    \ and the number of detected genes with mixture models in a probabilistic framework\
    \ to predict the low-quality cells in a given dataset."
