about:
  description: This package provides reference data required for ewce. Expression
    Weighted Celltype Enrichment (EWCE) is used to determine which cell types are
    enriched within gene lists. The package provides tools for testing enrichments
    within simple gene lists (such as human disease associated genes) and those resulting
    from differential expression studies. The package does not depend upon any particular
    Single Cell Transcriptome dataset and user defined datasets can be loaded in and
    used in the analyses.
