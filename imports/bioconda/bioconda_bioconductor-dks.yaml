about:
  description: The dks package consists of a set of diagnostic functions for multiple
    testing methods. The functions can be used to determine if the p-values produced
    by a multiple testing procedure are correct. These functions are designed to be
    applied to simulated data. The functions require the entire set of p-values from
    multiple simulated studies, so that the joint distribution can be evaluated.
