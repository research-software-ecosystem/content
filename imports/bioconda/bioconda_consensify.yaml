about:
  about: Consensify is a method for generating a consensus pseudohaploid genome sequence
    with greatly reduced error rates compared to standard pseudohaploidisation. The
    method is described in full and tested in the associated publication (Barlow et
    al. (2020), Genes 11:50, doi 10.3390/genes11010050).
