about:
  description: The CNVMetrics package calculates similarity metrics to facilitate
    copy number variant comparison among samples and/or methods. Similarity metrics
    can be employed to compare CNV profiles of genetically unrelated samples as well
    as those with a common genetic background. Some metrics are based on the shared
    amplified/deleted regions while other metrics rely on the level of amplification/deletion.
    The data type used as input is a plain text file containing the genomic position
    of the copy number variations, as well as the status and/or the log2 ratio values.
    Finally, a visualization tool is provided to explore resulting metrics.
