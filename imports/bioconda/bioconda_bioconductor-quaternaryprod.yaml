about:
  description: QuaternaryProd is an R package that performs causal reasoning on biological
    networks, including publicly available networks such as STRINGdb. QuaternaryProd
    is an open-source alternative to commercial products such as Inginuity Pathway
    Analysis. For a given a set of differentially expressed genes, QuaternaryProd
    computes the significance of upstream regulators in the network by performing
    causal reasoning using the Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic (Quaternary
    Statistic), Ternary Dot product Scoring Statistic (Ternary Statistic) and Fisher's
    exact test (Enrichment test). The Quaternary Statistic handles signed, unsigned
    and ambiguous edges in the network. Ambiguity arises when the direction of causality
    is unknown, or when the source node (e.g., a protein) has edges with conflicting
    signs for the same target gene. On the other hand, the Ternary Statistic provides
    causal reasoning using the signed and unambiguous edges only. The Vignette provides
    more details on the Quaternary Statistic and illustrates an example of how to
    perform causal reasoning using STRINGdb.
