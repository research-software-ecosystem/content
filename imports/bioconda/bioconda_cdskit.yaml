about:
  description: 'CDSKIT is a Python program that processes DNA sequences,

    especially protein-coding sequences. Many functions of this program are

    designed to handle DNA sequences using codons (sets of three nucleotides)

    as the unit, and therefore, edits the coding sequences without causing a

    frameshift. All sequence formats supported by Biopython are available in

    this tool for both inputs and outputs.
