about:
  description: "'A collection of measures for measuring ecological diversity.\n Ecological\
    \ diversity comes in two flavors: alpha diversity measures the\n diversity within\
    \ a single site or sample, and beta diversity measures the\n diversity across\
    \ two sites or samples. This package overlaps considerably\n with other R packages\
    \ such as ''vegan'', ''gUniFrac'', ''betapart'', and ''fossil''.\n We also include\
    \ a wide range of functions that are implemented in software\n outside the R ecosystem,\
    \ such as ''scipy'', ''Mothur'', and ''scikit-bio''.  The\n implementations here\
    \ are designed to be basic and clear to the reader.'"
