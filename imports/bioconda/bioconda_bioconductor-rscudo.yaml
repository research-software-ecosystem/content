about:
  description: SCUDO (Signature-based Clustering for Diagnostic Purposes) is a rank-based
    method for the analysis of gene expression profiles for diagnostic and classification
    purposes. It is based on the identification of sample-specific gene signatures
    composed of the most up- and down-regulated genes for that sample. Starting from
    gene expression data, functions in this package identify sample-specific gene
    signatures and use them to build a graph of samples. In this graph samples are
    joined by edges if they have a similar expression profile, according to a pre-computed
    similarity matrix. The similarity between the expression profiles of two samples
    is computed using a method similar to GSEA. The graph of samples can then be used
    to perform community clustering or to perform supervised classification of samples
    in a testing set.
