about:
  description: The skewr package is a tool for visualizing the output of the Illumina
    Human Methylation 450k BeadChip to aid in quality control. It creates a panel
    of nine plots. Six of the plots represent the density of either the methylated
    intensity or the unmethylated intensity given by one of three subsets of the 485,577
    total probes. These subsets include Type I-red, Type I-green, and Type II.The
    remaining three distributions give the density of the Beta-values for these same
    three subsets. Each of the nine plots optionally displays the distributions of
    the "rs" SNP probes and the probes associated with imprinted genes as series of
    'tick' marks located above the x-axis.
