about:
  description: The CellScore Standard Dataset contains expression data from a wide
    variety of human cells and tissues, which should be used as standard cell types
    in the calculation of the CellScore. All data was curated from public databases
    such as Gene Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) or ArrayExpress
    (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). This standard dataset only contains data
    from the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Samples were
    manually annotated using the database information or consulting the publications
    in which the datasets originated. The sample annotations are stored in the phenoData
    slot of the expressionSet object. Raw data (CEL files) were processed with the
    affy package to generate present/absent calls (mas5calls) and background-subtracted
    values, which were then normalized by the R-package yugene to yield the final
    expression values for the standard expression matrix. The annotation table for
    the microarray was retrieved from the BioC annotation package hgu133plus2. All
    data are stored in an expressionSet object.
