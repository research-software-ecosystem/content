  description: 'MetaCluster5.1 is an unsupervised binning method that can (1) samples
    with

    low-abundance species, or (2) samples (even with high-abundance) with many

    extremely-low-abundance species. The input file should be in fasta format.

    Every odd-number read and its next read are supposed to be pair-end reads.
