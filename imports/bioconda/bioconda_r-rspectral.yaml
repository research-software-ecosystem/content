  summary: "Implements the network clustering algorithm described in Newman (2006)\
    \ <doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.74.036104>. The complete iterative algorithm comprises\
    \ of two steps. In the first step, the network is expressed in terms of its leading\
    \ eigenvalue and eigenvector and recursively partition into two communities. Partitioning\
    \ occurs if the maximum positive eigenvalue is greater than the tolerance (10e-5)\
    \ for the current partition, and if it results in a positive contribution to the\
    \ Modularity. Given an initial separation using the leading eigen step, 'rSpectral'\
    \ then continues to maximise for the change in Modularity using a fine-tuning\
    \ step - or variate thereof. The first stage here is to find the node which, when\
    \ moved from one community to another, gives the maximum change in Modularity.\
    \ This node\u2019s community is then fixed and we repeat the process until all\
    \ nodes have been moved. The whole process is repeated from this new state until\
    \ the change in the Modularity, between the new and old state, is less than the\
    \ predefined tolerance. A slight variant of the fine-tuning step, which can improve\
    \ speed of the calculation, is also provided. Instead of moving each node into\
    \ each community in turn, we only consider moves of neighbouring nodes, found\
    \ in different communities, to the community of the current node of interest.\
    \ The two steps process is repeatedly applied to each new community found, subdivided\
    \ each community into two new communities, until we are unable to find any division\
    \ that results in a positive change in Modularity."
