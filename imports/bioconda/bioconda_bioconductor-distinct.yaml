about:
  description: 'distinct is a statistical method to perform differential testing between
    two or more groups of distributions; differential testing is performed via hierarchical
    non-parametric permutation tests on the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs)
    of each sample. While most methods for differential expression target differences
    in the mean abundance between conditions, distinct, by comparing full cdfs, identifies,
    both, differential patterns involving changes in the mean, as well as more subtle
    variations that do not involve the mean (e.g., unimodal vs. bi-modal distributions
    with the same mean). distinct is a general and flexible tool: due to its fully
    non-parametric nature, which makes no assumptions on how the data was generated,
    it can be applied to a variety of datasets. It is particularly suitable to perform
    differential state analyses on single cell data (i.e., differential analyses within
    sub-populations of cells), such as single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and
    high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry (HDCyto) data. To use distinct one needs
    data from two or more groups of samples (i.e., experimental conditions), with
    at least 2 samples (i.e., biological replicates) per group.'
