about:
  description: '"rhinotypeR" is designed to automate the comparison of sequence data
    against prototype strains, streamlining the genotype assignment process. By implementing
    predefined pairwise distance thresholds, this package makes genotype assignment
    accessible to researchers and public health professionals. This tool enhances
    our epidemiological toolkit by enabling more efficient surveillance and analysis
    of rhinoviruses (RVs) and other viral pathogens with complex genomic landscapes.
    Additionally, "rhinotypeR" supports comprehensive visualization and analysis of
    single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid substitutions, facilitating
    in-depth genetic and evolutionary studies.'
