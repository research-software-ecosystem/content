  description: Functional enrichment analysis methods such as gene set enrichment
    analysis (GSEA) have been widely used for analyzing gene expression data. GSEA
    is a powerful method to infer results of gene expression data at a level of gene
    sets by calculating enrichment scores for predefined sets of genes. GSEA depends
    on the availability and accuracy of gene sets. There are overlaps between terms
    of gene sets or categories because multiple terms may exist for a single biological
    process, and it can thus lead to redundancy within enriched terms. In other words,
    the sets of related terms are overlapping. Using deep learning, this pakage is
    aimed to predict enrichment scores for unique tokens or words from text in names
    of gene sets to resolve this overlapping set issue. Furthermore, we can coin a
    new term by combining tokens and find its enrichment score by predicting such
    a combined tokens.
