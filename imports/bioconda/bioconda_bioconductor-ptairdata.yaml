about:
  description: 'The package ptairData contains two raw datasets from Proton-Transfer-Reaction
    Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer acquisitions (PTR-TOF-MS), in the HDF5 format.
    One from the exhaled air of two volunteer healthy individuals with three replicates,
    and one from the cell culture headspace from two mycobacteria species and one
    control (culture medium only) with two replicates. Those datasets are used in
    the examples and in the vignette of the ptairMS package (PTR-TOF-MS data pre-processing).
    There are also used to gererate the ptrSet in the ptairMS data : exhaledPtrset
    and mycobacteriaSet'
