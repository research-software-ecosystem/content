about:
  description: Samples large data such that spectral clustering is possible while
    preserving density information in edge weights. More specifically, given a matrix
    of coordinates as input, SamSPECTRAL first builds the communities to sample the
    data points. Then, it builds a graph and after weighting the edges by conductance
    computation, the graph is passed to a classic spectral clustering algorithm to
    find the spectral clusters. The last stage of SamSPECTRAL is to combine the spectral
    clusters. The resulting "connected components" estimate biological cell populations
    in the data. See the vignette for more details on how to use this package, some
    illustrations, and simple examples.
