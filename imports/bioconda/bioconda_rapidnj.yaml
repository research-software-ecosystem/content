  summary: RapidNJ is an algorithmic engineered implementation of canonical neighbour-joining.
    It uses an efficient search heuristic to speed-up the core computations of the
    neighbour-joining method that enables RapidNJ to outperform other state-of-the-art
    neighbour-joining implementations.
