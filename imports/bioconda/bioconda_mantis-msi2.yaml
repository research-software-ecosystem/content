about:
  description: 'MANTIS2 (Microsatellite Analysis for Normal-Tumor InStability) is
    a program developed for detecting microsatellite instability from paired-end BAM
    files. To perform analysis, the program needs a tumor BAM and a matched normal
    BAM file (produced using the same pipeline) to determine the instability score
    between the two samples within the pair. Longer reads (ideally, 100 bp or longer)
    are recommended, as shorter reads are unlikely to entirely cover the microsatellite
    loci, and will be discarded after failing the quality control filters.  Originally
    developed and maintained here: https://github.com/OSU-SRLab/MANTIS.
