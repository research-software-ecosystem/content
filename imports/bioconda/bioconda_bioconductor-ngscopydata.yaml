  description: Subset of BAM files of human lung tumor and pooled normal samples by
    targeted panel sequencing. [Zhao et al 2014. Targeted Sequencing in Non-Small
    Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) Using the University of North Carolina (UNC) Sequencing
    Assay Captures Most Previously Described Genetic Aberrations in NSCLC. In preparation.]
    Each sample is a 10 percent random subsample drawn from the original sequencing
    data. The pooled normal sample has been rescaled accroding to the total number
    of normal samples in the "pool". Here provided is the subsampled data on chr6
    (hg19).
