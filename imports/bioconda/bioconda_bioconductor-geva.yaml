  description: Statistic methods to evaluate variations of differential expression
    (DE) between multiple biological conditions. It takes into account the fold-changes
    and p-values from previous differential expression (DE) results that use large-scale
    data (*e.g.*, microarray and RNA-seq) and evaluates which genes would react in
    response to the distinct experiments. This evaluation involves an unique pipeline
    of statistical methods, including weighted summarization, quantile detection,
    cluster analysis, and ANOVA tests, in order to classify a subset of relevant genes
    whose DE is similar or dependent to certain biological factors.
