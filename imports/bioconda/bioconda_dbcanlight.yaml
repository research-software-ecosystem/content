about:
  description: 'Dbcanlight is a lightweight rewrite of a widely used CAZyme annotation
    tool run_dbcan. It uses pyhmmer, a Cython binding to

    HMMER3, in place of the HMMER3 CLI suite as the backend for search processes,
    improving multithreading performance. In

    addition, it removes a limitation in run_dbcan that required manual splitting
    of large sequence files beforehand.


    The main program dbcanlight comprises three modules - build, search and conclude.
    The build module help to download the

    required databases from dbcan website; the search module searches against protein
    HMM, substrate HMM or diamond databases and

    reports the hits separately; and the conclude module gathers all the results made
    by each module and provides a summary. The

    output format closely resembles that of run_dbcan, with minor cleanup. For example,
    run_dbcan may report the same substrate

    multiple times for a gene matching several profiles with that substrate, whereas
    dbcanlight reports it only once.


    Dbcanlight only reimplemented the core features of run_dbcan, that is searching
    for CAZyme and substrate matches by

    hmmer/diamond/dbcansub. Submodules like signalP, CGCFinder, etc. are not implemented.
