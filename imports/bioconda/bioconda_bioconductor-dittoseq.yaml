about:
  description: A universal, user friendly, single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing visualization
    toolkit that allows highly customizable creation of color blindness friendly,
    publication-quality figures. dittoSeq accepts both SingleCellExperiment (SCE)
    and Seurat objects, as well as the import and usage, via conversion to an SCE,
    of SummarizedExperiment or DGEList bulk data. Visualizations include dimensionality
    reduction plots, heatmaps, scatterplots, percent composition or expression across
    groups, and more. Customizations range from size and title adjustments to automatic
    generation of annotations for heatmaps, overlay of trajectory analysis onto any
    dimensionality reduciton plot, hidden data overlay upon cursor hovering via ggplotly
    conversion, and many more. All with simple, discrete inputs. Color blindness friendliness
    is powered by legend adjustments (enlarged keys), and by allowing the use of shapes
    or letter-overlay in addition to the carefully selected dittoColors().
