about:
  description: The ORFhunteR package is a R and C++ library for an automatic determination
    and annotation of open reading frames (ORF) in a large set of RNA molecules. It
    efficiently implements the machine learning model based on vectorization of nucleotide
    sequences and the random forest classification algorithm. The ORFhunteR package
    consists of a set of functions written in the R language in conjunction with C++.
    The efficiency of the package was confirmed by the examples of the analysis of
    RNA molecules from the NCBI RefSeq and Ensembl databases. The package can be used
    in basic and applied biomedical research related to the study of the transcriptome
    of normal as well as altered (for example, cancer) human cells.
