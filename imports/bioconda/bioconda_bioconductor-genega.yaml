about:
  description: R based Genetic algorithm for gene expression optimization by considering
    both mRNA secondary structure and codon usage bias, GeneGA includes the information
    of highly expressed genes of almost 200 genomes. Meanwhile, Vienna RNA Package
    is needed to ensure GeneGA to function properly.
