about:
  description: 'KCFTOOLS is a Java-based tool designed to identify genomic variations
    by analyzing k-mer counts between

    reference and query sequences. The tool leverages k-mer counting databases, such
    as those generated by

    KMC, to perform a variety of analyses, including variation detection, IBS window
    identification, and

    genotype matrix generation.
