  description: 'Development version of GROMACS in colaboration to MDDB to add the

    possibility to export tpr to json.


    GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e.

    simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds

    to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical

    molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of

    complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast

    at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate

    simulations) many groups are also using it for research on

    non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.
