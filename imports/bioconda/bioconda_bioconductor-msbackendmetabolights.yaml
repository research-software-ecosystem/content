about:
  description: MetaboLights is one of the main public repositories for storage of
    metabolomics experiments, which includes analysis results as well as raw data.
    The MsBackendMetaboLights package provides functionality to retrieve and represent
    mass spectrometry (MS) data from MetaboLights. Data files are downloaded and cached
    locally avoiding repetitive downloads. MS data from metabolomics experiments can
    thus be directly and seamlessly integrated into R-based analysis workflows with
    the Spectra and MsBackendMetaboLights package.
