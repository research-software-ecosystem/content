  description: 'Full genome sequences for Macaca mulatta (Rhesus) as provided by UCSC
    (rheMac2, Jan. 2006) and stored in Biostrings objects. The sequences are the same
    as in BSgenome.Mmulatta.UCSC.rheMac2, except that each of them has the 4 following
    masks on top: (1) the mask of assembly gaps (AGAPS mask), (2) the mask of intra-contig
    ambiguities (AMB mask), (3) the mask of repeats from RepeatMasker (RM mask), and
    (4) the mask of repeats from Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF mask). Only the AGAPS
    and AMB masks are "active" by default.  NOTE: In most assemblies available at
    UCSC, Tandem Repeats Finder repeats were filtered to retain only the repeats with
    period <= 12.  However, the filtering was omitted for this assembly, so the TRF
    masks contain all Tandem Repeats Finder results.'
