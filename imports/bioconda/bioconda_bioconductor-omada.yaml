  description: "Symptomatic heterogeneity in complex diseases reveals differences\
    \ in molecular states that need to be investigated. However, selecting the numerous\
    \ parameters of an exploratory clustering analysis in RNA profiling studies requires\
    \ deep understanding of machine learning and extensive computational experimentation.\
    \ Tools that assist with such decisions without prior field knowledge are nonexistent\
    \ and further gene association analyses need to be performed independently. We\
    \ have developed a suite of tools to automate these processes and make robust\
    \ unsupervised clustering of transcriptomic data more accessible through automated\
    \ machine learning based functions. The efficiency of each tool was tested with\
    \ four datasets characterised by different expression signal strengths. Our toolkit\u2019\
    s decisions reflected the real number of stable partitions in datasets where the\
    \ subgroups are discernible. Even in datasets with less clear biological distinctions,\
    \ stable subgroups with different expression profiles and clinical associations\
    \ were found."
