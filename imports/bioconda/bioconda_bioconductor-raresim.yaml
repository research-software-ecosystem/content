about:
  description: Haplotype simulations of rare variant genetic data that emulates real
    data can be performed with RAREsim. RAREsim uses the expected number of variants
    in MAC bins - either as provided by default parameters or estimated from target
    data - and an abundance of rare variants as simulated HAPGEN2 to probabilistically
    prune variants. RAREsim produces haplotypes that emulate real sequencing data
    with respect to the total number of variants, allele frequency spectrum, haplotype
    structure, and variant annotation.
