about:
  description: 'Datasets of accompany Harman, a PCA and constrained optimisation based
    technique. Contains three example datasets: IMR90, Human lung fibroblast cells
    exposed to nitric oxide; NPM, an experiment to test skin penetration of metal
    oxide nanoparticles following topical application of sunscreens in non-pregnant
    mice; OLF; an experiment to gauge the response of human olfactory neurosphere-derived
    (hONS) cells to ZnO nanoparticles. Since version 1.24, this package also contains
    the Infinium5 dataset, a set of batch correction adjustments across 5 Illumina
    Infinium Methylation BeadChip datasets. This file does not contain methylation
    data, but summary statistics of 5 datasets after correction. There is also an
    EpiSCOPE_sample file as exampling for the new methylation clustering functionality
    in Harman.'
