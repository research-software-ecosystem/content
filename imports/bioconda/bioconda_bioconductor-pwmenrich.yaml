about:
  description: A toolkit of high-level functions for DNA motif scanning and enrichment
    analysis built upon Biostrings. The main functionality is PWM enrichment analysis
    of already known PWMs (e.g. from databases such as MotifDb), but the package also
    implements high-level functions for PWM scanning and visualisation. The package
    does not perform "de novo" motif discovery, but is instead focused on using motifs
    that are either experimentally derived or computationally constructed by other
    tools.
