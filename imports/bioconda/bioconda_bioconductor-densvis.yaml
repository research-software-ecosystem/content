  description: Implements the density-preserving modification to t-SNE and UMAP described
    by Narayan et al. (2020) <doi:10.1101/2020.05.12.077776>. The non-linear dimensionality
    reduction techniques t-SNE and UMAP enable users to summarise complex high-dimensional
    sequencing data such as single cell RNAseq using lower dimensional representations.
    These lower dimensional representations enable the visualisation of discrete transcriptional
    states, as well as continuous trajectory (for example, in early development).
    However, these methods focus on the local neighbourhood structure of the data.
    In some cases, this results in misleading visualisations, where the density of
    cells in the low-dimensional embedding does not represent the transcriptional
    heterogeneity of data in the original high-dimensional space. den-SNE and densMAP
    aim to enable more accurate visual interpretation of high-dimensional datasets
    by producing lower-dimensional embeddings that accurately represent the heterogeneity
    of the original high-dimensional space, enabling the identification of homogeneous
    and heterogeneous cell states. This accuracy is accomplished by including in the
    optimisation process a term which considers the local density of points in the
    original high-dimensional space. This can help to create visualisations that are
    more representative of heterogeneity in the original high-dimensional space.
