  description: "EternaFold performs multitask learning to improve RNA structure prediction.\
    \ \nIts training tasks include 1) predicting single structures, 2) maximizing\
    \ the \nlikelihood of structure probing data, and 3) predicting experimentally-measured\
    \ \naffinities of RNA molecules to proteins and small molecules. Described in\
    \ the paper \nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01605-0\n"
