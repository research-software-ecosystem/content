about:
  description: Enriched heatmap is a special type of heatmap which visualizes the
    enrichment of genomic signals on specific target regions. Here we implement enriched
    heatmap by ComplexHeatmap package. Since this type of heatmap is just a normal
    heatmap but with some special settings, with the functionality of ComplexHeatmap,
    it would be much easier to customize the heatmap as well as concatenating to a
    list of heatmaps to show correspondance between different data sources.
