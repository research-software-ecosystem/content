about:
  description: 'IonQuant is a fast and comprehensive tool for MS1 precursor intensity-based
    quantification for timsTOF PASEF DDA and non-timsTOF (e.g., Orbitrap) data.

    It enables label-free quantification with false discovery (FDR) controlled match-between-runs
    (MBR).

    It can also be used for quantification in labelling-based experiments such as
    those involving SILAC, dimethyl, or similar labelling strategies.
