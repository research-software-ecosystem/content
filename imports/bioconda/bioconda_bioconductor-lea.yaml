about:
  description: LEA is an R package dedicated to population genomics, landscape genomics
    and genotype-environment association tests. LEA can run analyses of population
    structure and genome-wide tests for local adaptation, and also performs imputation
    of missing genotypes. The package includes statistical methods for estimating
    ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and for evaluating the number
    of ancestral populations (snmf). It performs statistical tests using latent factor
    mixed models for identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit association with
    environmental gradients or phenotypic traits (lfmm2). In addition, LEA computes
    values of genetic offset statistics based on new or predicted environments (genetic.gap,
    genetic.offset). LEA is mainly based on optimized programs that can scale with
    the dimensions of large data sets.
