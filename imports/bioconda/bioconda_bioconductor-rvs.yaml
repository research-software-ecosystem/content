  description: Rare Variant Sharing (RVS) implements tests of association and linkage
    between rare genetic variant genotypes and a dichotomous phenotype, e.g. a disease
    status, in family samples. The tests are based on probabilities of rare variant
    sharing by relatives under the null hypothesis of absence of linkage and association
    between the rare variants and the phenotype and apply to single variants or multiple
    variants in a region (e.g. gene-based test).
