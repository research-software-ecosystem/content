about:
  description: This is an ExperimentHub package that provides access to the data at
    the gene, exon, transcript and junction level used in the analyses of the smokingMouse
    project. See https://github.com/LieberInstitute/smokingMouse_Indirects. This datasets
    contain the expression counts of genes, transcripts, exons and exon-exon junctions
    across 208 mice samples from pup and adult brains and adult blood. They also contain
    relevant information of these samples and features, such as conditions, QC metrics
    and if they were used after filtering steps and also if the features were differently
    expressed in the different experiments.
