  summary: 'Collection of functions to connect the structure of the data with the
    information on the samples. Three types of associations are covered: 1. linear
    model of principal components. 2. hierarchical clustering analysis. 3. distribution
    of features-sample annotation associations. Additionally, the inter-relation between
    sample annotations can be analyzed. Simple methods are provided for the correction
    of batch effects and removal of principal components.'
