  summary: RNAshape abstraction maps structures to a tree-like domain of shapes, retaining
    adjacency and nesting of structural features, but disregarding helix lengths.
    Shape abstraction integrates well with dynamic programming algorithms, and hence
    it can be applied during structure prediction rather than afterwards. This avoids
    exponential explosion and can still give us a non-heuristic and complete account
    of properties of the molecule's folding space.
