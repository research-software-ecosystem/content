  summary: "Clair3-Trio is a variants caller tailored for family trios from nanopore\
    \ long-reads. Clair3-Trio employs a Trio-to-Trio deep neural network model that\
    \ allows it to input all trio\u2019s sequencing information and output all trio\u2019\
    s predicted variants within a single model, to perform far better variant calling.\
    \ We also present MCVLoss, the first loss function that can improve variants calling\
    \ in trios by leveraging the explicitly encoding of the priors of the Mendelian\
    \ inheritance in trios. Clair3-Trio showed comprehensive improvement in experiments.\
    \ It predicted much fewer Mendelian inheritance violation variations than current\
    \ state-of-the-art methods."
