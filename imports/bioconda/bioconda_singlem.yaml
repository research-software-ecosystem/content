  summary: At heart, SingleM is a tool for profiling shotgun metagenomes. It was originally
    designed to determine the relative abundance of bacterial and archaeal taxa in
    a sample. As of version 0.19.0, it can also be used to profile dsDNA phages (see
    Lyrebird). It shows good accuracy in estimating the relative abundances of community
    members, and has a particular strength in dealing with novel lineages. The method
    it uses also makes it suitable for some related tasks, such as assessing eukaryotic
    contamination, finding bias in genome recovery, and lineage-targeted MAG recovery.
    It can also be used as the basis for choosing metagenomes which, when coassembled,
    maximise the recovery of novel MAGs (see Bin Chicken).
