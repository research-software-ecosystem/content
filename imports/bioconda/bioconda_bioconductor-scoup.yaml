about:
  description: An elaborate molecular evolutionary framework that facilitates straightforward
    simulation of codon genetic sequences subjected to different degrees and/or patterns
    of Darwinian selection. The model was built upon the fitness landscape paradigm
    of Sewall Wright, as popularised by the mutation-selection model of Halpern and
    Bruno. This enabled realistic evolutionary process of living organisms to be reproduced
    seamlessly. For example, an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck fitness update algorithm is incorporated
    herein. Consequently, otherwise complex biological processes, such as the effect
    of the interplay between genetic drift and mutation on the inference of diversifying
    selection, may now be investigated with minimal effort. Frequency-dependent and
    deterministic fitness landscape update techniques are also available.
