about:
  description: 'UPIMAPI takes as input either a list of UniProt IDs or a blast file
    from

    annotation using UniProt database as reference and uses UniProt''s API to

    retrieve information relative to those IDs. It is essentially a command

    line implementation of UniProt''s ID mapping web service available at

    https://www.uniprot.org/uploadlists/, allowing for retrieval of information

    from thousands of IDs in one go, while still relying on the web service.
