about:
  description: Volcano plots represent a useful way to visualise the results of differential
    expression analyses. Here, we present a highly-configurable function that produces
    publication-ready volcano plots. EnhancedVolcano will attempt to fit as many point
    labels in the plot window as possible, thus avoiding 'clogging' up the plot with
    labels that could not otherwise have been read. Other functionality allows the
    user to identify up to 4 different types of attributes in the same plot space
    via colour, shape, size, and shade parameter configurations.
