  summary: Performs gene set analysis based on GSZ scoring function and asymptotic
    p-value. It is different from GSZ in that it implements asymptotic p-values instead
    of empirical p-values. Asymptotic p-values are calculated by fitting suitable
    distribution model to the null distribution. Unlike empirical p-values, resolution
    of asymptotic p-values are independent of the number of permutations and hence
    requires considerably fewer permutations. In addition, this package allows gene
    set analysis with seven other popular gene set analysis methods.
