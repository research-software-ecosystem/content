  description: Current gene set enrichment methods rely upon permutations for inference.  These
    approaches are computationally expensive and have minimum achievable p-values
    based on the number of permutations, not on the actual observed statistics.  We
    have derived three parametric approximations to the permutation distributions
    of two gene set enrichment test statistics.  We are able to reduce the computational
    burden and granularity issues of permutation testing with our method, which is
    implemented in this package. npGSEA calculates gene set enrichment statistics
    and p-values without the computational cost of permutations.  It is applicable
    in settings where one or many gene sets are of interest.  There are also built-in
    plotting functions to help users visualize results.
