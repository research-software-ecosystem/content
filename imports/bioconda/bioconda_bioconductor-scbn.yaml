about:
  description: This package provides a scale based normalization (SCBN) method to
    identify genes with differential expression between different species. It takes
    into account the available knowledge of conserved orthologous genes and the hypothesis
    testing framework to detect differentially expressed orthologous genes. The method
    on this package are described in the article 'A statistical normalization method
    and differential expression analysis for RNA-seq data between different species'
    by Yan Zhou, Jiadi Zhu, Tiejun Tong, Junhui Wang, Bingqing Lin, Jun Zhang (2018,
    pending publication).
