  description: "biobb_flexserv allows the generation of protein conformational ensembles\
    \ from 3D structures and the analysis of its molecular flexibility. It is based\
    \ on the work included in the FlexServ server (https://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/FlexServ/,\
    \ Camps et. al., FlexServ: an integrated tool for the analysis of protein flexibility,\
    \ Bioinformatics, Volume 25, Issue 13, 1 July 2009, Pages 1709\u20131710, https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btp304).\n\
    Biobb (BioExcel building blocks) packages are Python building blocks that\ncreate\
    \ new layer of compatibility and interoperability over popular\n  bioinformatics\
