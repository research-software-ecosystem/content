  summary: Test for association between the observed data and their systematic patterns
    of variations. Systematic patterns may be captured by latent variables using principal
    component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and related methods. The jackstraw
    enables statistical testing for association between observed variables and latent
    variables, as captured by PCs or other estimates. Similarly, unsupervised clustering,
    such as K-means clustering, partition around medoids (PAM), and others, finds
    subpopulations among the observed variables. The jackstraw estimates statistical
    significance of cluster membership, including unsupervised evaluation of cell
    identities in single cell RNA-seq. P-values and posterior probabilities allows
    one to rigorously evaluate the strength of cluster membership assignments.
