  description: "This lightweight R package provides a method for normalizing and denoising\
    \ protein expression data from droplet based single cell experiments. Raw protein\
    \ Unique Molecular Index (UMI) counts from sequencing DNA-conjugated antibody\
    \ derived tags (ADT) in droplets (e.g. 'CITE-seq') have substantial measurement\
    \ noise. Our experiments and computational modeling revealed two major components\
    \ of this noise: 1) protein-specific noise originating from ambient, unbound antibody\
    \ encapsulated in droplets that can be accurately inferred via the expected protein\
    \ counts detected in empty droplets, and 2) droplet/cell-specific noise revealed\
    \ via the shared variance component associated with isotype antibody controls\
    \ and background protein counts in each cell. This package normalizes and removes\
    \ both of these sources of noise from raw protein data derived from methods such\
    \ as 'CITE-seq', 'REAP-seq', 'ASAP-seq', 'TEA-seq', 'proteogenomic' data from\
    \ the Mission Bio platform, etc. See the vignette for tutorials on how to integrate\
    \ dsb with 'Seurat' and 'Bioconductor' and how to use dsb in 'Python'. Please\
    \ see our paper Mul\xE8 M.P., Martins A.J., and Tsang J.S. Nature Communications\
    \ 2022 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29356-8> for more details on\
    \ the method."
