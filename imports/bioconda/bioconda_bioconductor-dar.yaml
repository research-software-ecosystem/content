  description: Differential abundance testing in microbiome data challenges both parametric
    and non-parametric statistical methods, due to its sparsity, high variability
    and compositional nature. Microbiome-specific statistical methods often assume
    classical distribution models or take into account compositional specifics. These
    produce results that range within the specificity vs sensitivity space in such
    a way that type I and type II error that are difficult to ascertain in real microbiome
    data when a single method is used. Recently, a consensus approach based on multiple
    differential abundance (DA) methods was recently suggested in order to increase
    robustness. With dar, you can use dplyr-like pipeable sequences of DA methods
    and then apply different consensus strategies. In this way we can obtain more
    reliable results in a fast, consistent and reproducible way.
