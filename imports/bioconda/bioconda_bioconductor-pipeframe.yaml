about:
  description: pipeFrame is an R package for building a componentized bioinformatics
    pipeline. Each step in this pipeline is wrapped in the framework, so the connection
    among steps is created seamlessly and automatically. Users could focus more on
    fine-tuning arguments rather than spending a lot of time on transforming file
    format, passing task outputs to task inputs or installing the dependencies. Componentized
    step elements can be customized into other new pipelines flexibly as well. This
    pipeline can be split into several important functional steps, so it is much easier
    for users to understand the complex arguments from each step rather than parameter
    combination from the whole pipeline. At the same time, componentized pipeline
    can restart at the breakpoint and avoid rerunning the whole pipeline, which may
    save a lot of time for users on pipeline tuning or such issues as power off or
    process other interrupts.
