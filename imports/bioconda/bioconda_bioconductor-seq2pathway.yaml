about:
  description: Seq2pathway is a novel tool for functional gene-set (or termed as pathway)
    analysis of next-generation sequencing data, consisting of "seq2gene" and "gene2path"
    components. The seq2gene links sequence-level measurements of genomic regions
    (including SNPs or point mutation coordinates) to gene-level scores, and the gene2pathway
    summarizes gene scores to pathway-scores for each sample. The seq2gene has the
    feasibility to assign both coding and non-exon regions to a broader range of neighboring
    genes than only the nearest one, thus facilitating the study of functional non-coding
    regions. The gene2pathway takes into account the quantity of significance for
    gene members within a pathway compared those outside a pathway. The output of
    seq2pathway is a general structure of quantitative pathway-level scores, thus
    allowing one to functional interpret such datasets as RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, GWAS,
    and derived from other next generational sequencing experiments.
