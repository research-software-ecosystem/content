about:
  description: Precise measurements are important for epigenome-wide studies investigating
    DNA methylation in whole blood samples, where effect sizes are expected to be
    small in magnitude. The 450K platform is often affected by batch effects and proper
    preprocessing is recommended. This package provides functions to read and normalize
    450K '.idat' files. The normalization corrects for dye bias and biases related
    to signal intensity and methylation of probes using local regression. No adjustment
    for probe type bias is performed to avoid the trade-off of precision for accuracy
    of beta-values.
