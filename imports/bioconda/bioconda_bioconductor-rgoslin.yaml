  description: The R implementation for the Grammar of Succint Lipid Nomenclature
    parses different short hand notation dialects for lipid names. It normalizes them
    to a standard name. It further provides calculated monoisotopic masses and sum
    formulas for each successfully parsed lipid name and supplements it with LIPID
    MAPS Category and Class information. Also, the structural level and further structural
    details about the head group, fatty acyls and functional groups are returned,
    where applicable.
