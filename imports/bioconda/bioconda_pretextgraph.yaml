about:
  description: This is a tool for converting data from a bedgraph format and embedding
    into a Hi-C contact map in the Pretext format. The graph data can then be displayed
    alongside the contact map using the PretextView desktop software (https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView).
    See https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextMap for how to generate Pretext contact
    maps, or search for pretextmap on bioconda.
