about:
  description: "A novel framework to correct for batch effects prior to any downstream\
    \ analysis in microbiome data based on Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant\
    \ Analysis. The main method is named \u201CPLSDA-batch\u201D. It first estimates\
    \ treatment and batch variation with latent components, then subtracts batch-associated\
    \ components from the data whilst preserving biological variation of interest.\
    \ PLSDA-batch is highly suitable for microbiome data as it is non-parametric,\
    \ multivariate and allows for ordination and data visualisation. Combined with\
    \ centered log-ratio transformation for addressing uneven library sizes and compositional\
    \ structure, PLSDA-batch addresses all characteristics of microbiome data that\
    \ existing correction methods have ignored so far. Two other variants are proposed\
    \ for 1/ unbalanced batch x treatment designs that are commonly encountered in\
    \ studies with small sample sizes, and for 2/ selection of discriminative variables\
    \ amongst treatment groups to avoid overfitting in classification problems. These\
    \ two variants have widened the scope of applicability of PLSDA-batch to different\
    \ data settings."
