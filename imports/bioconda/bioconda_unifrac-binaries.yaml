about:
  description: 'UniFrac is a commonly phylogenetic diversity distance metric used
    in

    microbiome research. The metric relates two microbiome samples together

    within the context of an evolutionary history, and produces a distance

    that corresponds to how similar two samples by the amount of overlapping

    branch length. This package contains command line utilities and

    a shared library.
