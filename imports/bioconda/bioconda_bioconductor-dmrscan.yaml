about:
  description: 'This package detects significant differentially methylated regions
    (for both qualitative and quantitative traits), using a scan statistic with underlying
    Poisson heuristics. The scan statistic will depend on a sequence of window sizes
    (# of CpGs within each window) and on a threshold for each window size. This threshold
    can be calculated by three different means: i) analytically using Siegmund et.al
    (2012) solution (preferred), ii) an important sampling as suggested by Zhang (2008),
    and a iii) full MCMC modeling of the data, choosing between a number of different
    options for modeling the dependency between each CpG.'
