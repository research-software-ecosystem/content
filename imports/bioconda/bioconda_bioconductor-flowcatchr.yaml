about:
  description: flowcatchR is a set of tools to analyze in vivo microscopy imaging
    data, focused on tracking flowing blood cells. It guides the steps from segmentation
    to calculation of features, filtering out particles not of interest, providing
    also a set of utilities to help checking the quality of the performed operations
    (e.g. how good the segmentation was). It allows investigating the issue of tracking
    flowing cells such as in blood vessels, to categorize the particles in flowing,
    rolling and adherent. This classification is applied in the study of phenomena
    such as hemostasis and study of thrombosis development. Moreover, flowcatchR presents
    an integrated workflow solution, based on the integration with a Shiny App and
    Jupyter notebooks, which is delivered alongside the package, and can enable fully
    reproducible bioimage analysis in the R environment.
