about:
  description: This package provides a method to identify differential expression
    genes in the same or different species. Given that non-DE genes have some similarities
    in features, a scaling-free minimum enclosing ball (SFMEB) model is built to cover
    those non-DE genes in feature space, then those DE genes, which are enormously
    different from non-DE genes, being regarded as outliers and rejected outside the
    ball. The method on this package is described in the article 'A minimum enclosing
    ball method to detect differential expression genes for RNA-seq data'. The SFMEB
    method is extended to the scMEB method that considering two or more potential
    types of cells or unknown labels scRNA-seq dataset DEGs identification.
