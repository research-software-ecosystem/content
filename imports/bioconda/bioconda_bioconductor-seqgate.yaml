  description: Filtering of lowly expressed features (e.g. genes) is a common step
    before performing statistical analysis, but an arbitrary threshold is generally
    chosen. SeqGate implements a method that rationalize this step by the analysis
    of the distibution of counts in replicate samples. The gate is the threshold above
    which sequenced features can be considered as confidently quantified.
