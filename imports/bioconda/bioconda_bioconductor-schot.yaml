about:
  description: Single cell Higher Order Testing (scHOT) is an R package that facilitates
    testing changes in higher order structure of gene expression along either a developmental
    trajectory or across space. scHOT is general and modular in nature, can be run
    in multiple data contexts such as along a continuous trajectory, between discrete
    groups, and over spatial orientations; as well as accommodate any higher order
    measurement such as variability or correlation. scHOT meaningfully adds to first
    order effect testing, such as differential expression, and provides a framework
    for interrogating higher order interactions from single cell data.
