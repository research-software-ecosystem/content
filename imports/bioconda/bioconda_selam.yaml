about:
  description: 'SELAM (Simulation of Epistasis, Local adaptation with Admixture and
    Mate

    choice) is a forward time population genetic simulation for studying

    admixture between ancestral subpopulations. This program tracks local

    ancestry along chromosomes. SELAM supports complex demography

    scenarios, including changes in population sizes, migration rates, and

    arbitrary numbers of subpopulations. This program can also accommodate

    sophisticated selective regimes, including dominance, epistasis, local

    adaptation, and mate choice.
