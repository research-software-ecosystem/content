about:
  description: Dropout events make the lowly expressed genes indistinguishable from
    true zero expression and different than the low expression present in cells of
    the same type. This issue makes any subsequent downstream analysis difficult.
    ccImpute is an imputation algorithm that uses cell similarity established by consensus
    clustering to impute the most probable dropout events in the scRNA-seq datasets.
    ccImpute demonstrated performance which exceeds the performance of existing imputation
    approaches while introducing the least amount of new noise as measured by clustering
    performance characteristics on datasets with known cell identities.
