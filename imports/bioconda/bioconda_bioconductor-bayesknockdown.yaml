  description: A simple, fast Bayesian method for computing posterior probabilities
    for relationships between a single predictor variable and multiple potential outcome
    variables, incorporating prior probabilities of relationships. In the context
    of knockdown experiments, the predictor variable is the knocked-down gene, while
    the other genes are potential targets. Can also be used for differential expression/2-class
    data.
