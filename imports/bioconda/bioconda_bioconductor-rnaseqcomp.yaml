  description: Several quantitative and visualized benchmarks for RNA-seq quantification
    pipelines. Two-condition quantifications for genes, transcripts, junctions or
    exons by each pipeline with necessary meta information should be organized into
    numeric matrices in order to proceed the evaluation.
