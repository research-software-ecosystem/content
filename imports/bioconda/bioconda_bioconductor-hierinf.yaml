  description: Tools to perform hierarchical inference for one or multiple studies
    / data sets based on high-dimensional multivariate (generalised) linear models.
    A possible application is to perform hierarchical inference for GWA studies to
    find significant groups or single SNPs (if the signal is strong) in a data-driven
    and automated procedure. The method is based on an efficient hierarchical multiple
    testing correction and controls the FWER. The functions can easily be run in parallel.
