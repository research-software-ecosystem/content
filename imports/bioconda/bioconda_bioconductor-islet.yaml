about:
  description: ISLET is a method to conduct signal deconvolution for general -omics
    data. It can estimate the individual-specific and cell-type-specific reference
    panels, when there are multiple samples observed from each subject. It takes the
    input of the observed mixture data (feature by sample matrix), and the cell type
    mixture proportions (sample by cell type matrix), and the sample-to-subject information.
    It can solve for the reference panel on the individual-basis and conduct test
    to identify cell-type-specific differential expression (csDE) genes. It also improves
    estimated cell type mixture proportions by integrating personalized reference
    panels.
