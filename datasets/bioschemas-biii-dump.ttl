The movie is discretized into small overlapping rolling windows which are individually classified for event detection by a trained neural network. Results are then put together in event probability map for the whole movie or as spatio-temporal points indicating each event.

Additional plugins provides an estimate of the rotation based on the gradient vector computed around the crop frame center. The gradient direction is used as vertical direction in the result, making it easier to generate 2D/3D images that are tangent to a surface such as the epidermis of an organ or organism.
