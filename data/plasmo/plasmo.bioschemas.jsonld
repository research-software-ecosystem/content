All of the models in the The Plant Systems Biology Modelling database have now been migrated to the FAIRDOMHub repository at https://fairdomhub.org/projects/129 | You can access the list of all the models here | Arabidopsis_clock_P2011 - PLM_64, version 3 | This model is termed P2011 and derives from the article: The clock gene circuit in Arabidopsis includes a repressilator with additional feedback loops | PlaSMo stands for Plant Systems-biology Modelling and the mission of the project was ensuring the achievements of yesterday's Mathematical Modellers will be available for the Systems Biologists of tomorrow | the Evening Complex genes (ELF4, ELF3, LUX),",
