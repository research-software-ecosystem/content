For the emerging field of discovery lipidomics via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), comparably mature informatics tools do not exist. Here, we introduce LipiDex, a freely available software suite that unifies and automates all stages of lipid identification, reducing hands-on processing time from hours to minutes for even the most expansive datasets. LipiDex utilizes flexible in silico fragmentation templates and lipid-optimized MS/MS spectral matching routines to confidently identify and track hundreds of lipid species and unknown compounds from diverse sample matrices. Unique spectral and chromatographic peak purity algorithms accurately quantify co-isolation and co-elution of isobaric lipids, generating identifications that match the structural resolution afforded by the LC-MS/MS experiment. During final data filtering, ionization artifacts are removed to significantly reduce dataset redundancy. LipiDex interfaces with several LC-MS/MS software packages, enabling robust lipid identification to be readily incorporated into pre-existing data workflows. Hutchins et al. introduce an open-source software suite that automates lipid identification and significantly reduces hands-on processing time for large LC-MS/MS lipidomic datasets. They demonstrate the confident identification of hundreds of diverse lipids from complex lipid extracts using optimized spectral matching techniques and multiple identification filters.","authors":["Hutchins P.D.","Russell J.D.","Coon J.J."],"cit_count":5,"doi":"10.1016/j.cels.2018.03.011","journal":"Cell Systems","pmid":"29705063","title":"LipiDex: An Integrated Software Package for High-Confidence Lipid Identification","type":"Primary","year":"2018-05-23"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:lipidex","biotoolsID":"lipidex","description":"A tool for high-confidence LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) lipid identification.","homepage":"https://github.com/coongroup/LipiDex","name":"LipiDex"}}
