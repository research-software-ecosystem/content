    "description": "Unified Biological Dictionaries (UniBioDicts) is a set of software packages that unite many of the most important biological controlled vocabularies, database vocabularies, and ontologies, under a common query-interface. These packages can access these disparate biological resources, and map their vocabulary data onto a common representation consisting of terms (which biocurators prefer to use), a unique identifier (which computers can reason with), and various descriptive metadata.\n\nThis cross-resource infrastructure is essential for an efficient, modernized biocuration process, as it directly enables the autocomplete-based curation of particularly context-rich annotations, that combine terminology from across biological niches.",
