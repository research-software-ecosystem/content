Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Systematically extracting biological meaning from omics data is a major challenge in systems biology. Enrichment analysis is often used to identify characteristic patterns in candidate lists. FungiFun is a user-friendly Web tool for functional enrichment analysis of fungal genes and proteins. The novel tool FungiFun2 uses a completely revised data management system and thus allows enrichment analysis for 298 currently available fungal strains published in standard databases. FungiFun2 offers a modern Web interface and creates interactive tables, charts and figures, which users can directly manipulate to their needs.","authors":["Priebe S.","Kreisel C.","Horn F.","Guthke R.","Linde J."],"cit_count":54,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25294921","title":"FungiFun2: A comprehensive online resource for systematic analysis of gene lists from fungal species","year":"2015-07-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fungifun","biotoolsID":"fungifun","description":"Assign functional annotations to fungal genes or proteins.
