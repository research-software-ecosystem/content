description: Computes Dunn's test (1964) for stochastic dominance and reports the
  results among multiple pairwise comparisons after a Kruskal-Wallis test for stochastic
  dominance among k groups (Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). The interpretation of stochastic
  dominance requires an assumption that the CDF of one group does not cross the CDF
  of the other. 'dunn.test' makes k(k-1)/2 multiple pairwise comparisons based on
  Dunn's z-test-statistic approximations to the actual rank statistics. The null hypothesis
  for each pairwise comparison is that the probability of observing a randomly selected
  value from the first group that is larger than a randomly selected value from the
  second group equals one half; this null hypothesis corresponds to that of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
  rank-sum test. Like the rank-sum test, if the data can be assumed to be continuous,
  and the distributions are assumed identical except for a difference in location,
  Dunn's test may be understood as a test for median difference. 'dunn.test' accounts
  for tied ranks.
