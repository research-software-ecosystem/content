                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Mate pair protocols add to the utility of paired-end sequencing by boosting the genomic distance spanned by each pair of reads, potentially allowing larger repeats to be bridged and resolved. The Illumina Nextera Mate Pair (NMP) protocol uses a circularization-based strategy that leaves behind 38-bp adapter sequences, which must be computationally removed from the data. While 'adapter trimming' is a well-studied area of bioinformatics, existing tools do not fully exploit the particular properties of NMP data and discard more data than is necessary. Results: We present NxTrim, a tool that strives to discard as little sequence as possible from NMP reads. NxTrim makes full use of the sequence on both sides of the adapter site to build 'virtual libraries' of mate pairs, paired-end reads and single-ended reads. For bacterial data, we show that aggregating these datasets allows a single NMP library to yield an assembly whose quality compares favourably to that obtained from regular paired-end reads.",
