Molecular genetic testing provides the capability for personalized prediction, diagnosis, and pharmacological treatments of disease and disorders. Variant assessment of next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a crucial component of genetic testing for clinicians to counsel patients on risk and management. The iVariantGuide application is a dynamic Web-based application made for the tertiary analysis of NGS. Along with variant assessment, iVariantGuide provides a unique interactive pathway impact analysis of genetic variants, as well as a unique Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. Here we provide a step-by-step guide on how to utilize iVariantGuide, employing a publicly available NGS dataset consisting of a cohort of germline DNAs from high-risk serous ovarian cancer (OVCA) patients. The application will be used to exhibit the ease in filtering down to a set of compelling novel variants and their impact on biological pathways and GO terms. \u00a9 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Chaudhry S.R."}, {"name": "Tainsky M.A."}], "date": "2019-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Current Protocols in Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "ADVAITA", "url": "https://advaitabio.com/contact/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": null, "email": "info@advaitabio.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:iVariantGuide", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://advaitabio.com/ivariantguide/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Enrichment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"}, {"term": "Variant filtering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3675"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-04T09:39:16Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Web-based application that provides variant assessment, interactive pathway impact analysis of genetic variants, as well as a unique Gene Ontology (GO) analysis.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "iVariantGuide", "additionDate": "2019-07-04T09:39:16Z", "name": "iVariantGuide", "license": "Proprietary", "documentation": [{"url": "https://advaitabio.com/ivariantguide-faqs/", "note": null, "type": "FAQ"}, {"url": "https://advaitabio.com/ivariantguide-tutorials/", "note": "Tutorial material", "type": "Training material"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
