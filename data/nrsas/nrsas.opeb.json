These servers are part of the NucleaRDB project, which provides a powerful information system for nuclear hormone receptors. The computations performed by the servers include homology modelling, structure validation, calculating contacts, accessibility values, hydrogen bonding patterns, predicting mutations and a host of two- and three-dimensional visualisations. The Nuclear Receptor Structure Analysis Servers (NRSAS) are freely accessible at http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/NR/servers/html/ and in-house copies can be obtained upon request.","authors":["Bettler E.","Krause R.","Horn F.","Vriend G."],"cit_count":4,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"12824335","title":"NRSAS: Nuclear receptor structure analysis servers","year":"2003-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nrsas","biotoolsID":"nrsas","description":"Multi-purpose collection of tools for the analyses of nuclear hormone receptors.","homepage":"http://www.receptors.org/NR/servers/html/","name":"NRSAS"}}
