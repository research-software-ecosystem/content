It is composed of two major components: a merged CNN as the front-end for extracting gRNA and epigenetic features as well as an SVR as the back-end for regression and predicting gRNA cleavage efficiency.",

Although some machine learning-based and convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been proposed, prediction accuracy remains to be improved. Here, firstly we improved architectures of current CNNs for predicting gRNA on-target efficacy. Secondly, we proposed a novel hybrid system which combines our improved CNN with support vector regression (SVR). This CNN-SVR system is composed of two major components: a merged CNN as the front-end for extracting gRNA feature and an SVR as the back-end for regression and predicting gRNA cleavage efficiency. We demonstrate that CNN-SVR can effectively exploit features interactions from feed-forward directions to learn deeper features of gRNAs and their corresponding epigenetic features. Experiments on commonly used datasets show that our CNN-SVR system outperforms available state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy, generalization, and robustness.
