VectorInfo elucidates and curates medically important Indian arthropod's biological, omics technologies to adopt a holistic view of the molecules that make up an organism, aimed at the detection of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, enzymes & pathways and immune specific genes. The nitty-gritty of VectorInfo is aimed at scrutinizing all the possible information on Indian disease vectors in a single window for the scientific community. The database affords 53 medically important Indian arthropod's biological and omics information well-structured and provided with downloadable facilities",
