      "sc:description": "iCAT: Immune Cells Analysis software Tool.\n\nHigh throughput sequencing of immune cell receptor sequences presents a unique opportunity to inform our understanding of immunological response to infection and how we can detect it. iCAT is a user-friendly, graphical-interface software that takes exposed and non-exposed samples of T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes as input and identifies pathogen-specific TCR sequences. Using these sequences, iCAT can also classify independent samples of TCR clonotypes. iCAT was able to identify vaccine-associated TCR sequences with up to 95% prediction accuracy in mice.",
