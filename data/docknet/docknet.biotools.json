Published by Oxford University Press.MOTIVATION: Over 300 000 protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs have been identified in the human proteome and targeting these is fast becoming the next frontier in drug design. Predicting PPI sites, however, is a challenging task that traditionally requires computationally expensive and time-consuming docking simulations. A major weakness of modern protein docking algorithms is the inability to account for protein flexibility, which ultimately leads to relatively poor results. RESULTS: Here, we propose DockNet, an efficient Siamese graph-based neural network method which predicts contact residues between two interacting proteins. Unlike other methods that only utilize a protein's surface or treat the protein structure as a rigid body, DockNet incorporates the entire protein structure and places no limits on protein flexibility during an interaction. Predictions are modeled at the residue level, based on a diverse set of input node features including residue type, surface accessibility, residue depth, secondary structure, pharmacophore and torsional angles. DockNet is comparable to current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) value of up to 0.84 on an independent test set (DB5), can be applied to a variety of different protein structures and can be utilized in situations where accurate unbound protein structures cannot be obtained. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DockNet is available at https://github.com/npwilliams09/docknet and an easy-to-use webserver at https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/docknet.
