  "sc:description": "The tool combines protein analyses of BLAST, FASTA, Pfam and ProtParam on a batch-file of protein sequences. It subsequently summarizes and organizes the output in an Access database format.More specifically, it extracts protein sequences after ORF prediction and subsequently performs an automatic analysis for each of the proteins. This analysis consists of web-based similarity searches as well as Pfam predictions and Protparam calculations of protein physicochemical properties.",
