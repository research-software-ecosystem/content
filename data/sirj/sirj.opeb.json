Despite their prevalence, many questions regarding how to interpret respondent choices or how variations in item construction and instruction influence the nature of observed responses remain. Existing conceptual and empirical efforts to explore these questions have largely been rooted in reflexive psychometric measurement models that describe participant responses as indicative of (usually multiple) latent constructs. However, some have suggested that a key to better understanding SJT responses lies in unpacking the judgment and decision-making processes employed by respondents and the psychological and contextual factors that shape how those processes play out. To this end, the present article advances an integrative and generalizable process-oriented theory of SJT responding","homepage":"https://grandjam.shinyapps.io/sirj","name":"SiRJ"}}
