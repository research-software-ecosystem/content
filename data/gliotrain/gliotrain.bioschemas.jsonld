New treatment options and effective precision medicine therapies are urgently required. GLIOTRAIN is a multi-sectoral industry-academia collaboration, funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN initiative, that will work to identify novel strategies to treat GBM as well as investigating resistance mechanisms in this devastating disease | A MARIE SKŁODOWSKA-CURIE ACTIONS (MSCA) Innovative Training Network (ITN)",
