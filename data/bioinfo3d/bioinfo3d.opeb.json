The FlexProt method performs flexible structural alignment of protein molecules. FlexProt simultaneously detects the hinge regions and aligns the rigid subparts of the molecules. It does not require an a priori knowledge of the flexible hinge regions. MultiProt and MASS perform simultaneous comparison of multiple protein structures. PatchDock performs prediction of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. The input to all services is either protein PDB codes or protein structures uploaded to the server. All the services are available at http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Shatsky M.","Dror O.","Schneidman-Duhovny D.","Nussinov R.","Wolfson H.J."],"cit_count":23,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15215437","title":"BioInfo3D: A suite of tools for structural bioinformatics","year":"2004-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:bioinfo3d","biotoolsID":"bioinfo3d","description":"BioInfo3D is a collection of tools for the structural analysis of proteins, including tools for structural alignments and prediction of protein interactions.","homepage":"http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/","name":"BioInfo3D"}}
