description: DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches
  and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST software tools. It is
  suitable for protein-protein search as well as DNA-protein search on short reads
  and longer sequences including contigs and assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST
  ranging up to x20,000.
