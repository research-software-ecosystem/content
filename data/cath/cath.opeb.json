For CATH version 3.4 we have significantly improved the presentation of sequence information and associated functional information for CATH superfamilies. The CATH superfamily pages now reflect both the functional and structural diversity within the superfamily and include structural alignments of close and distant relatives within the superfamily, annotated with functional information and details of conserved residues. A significantly more efficient search function for CATH has been established by implementing the search server Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr/). The CATH v3.4 webpages have been built using the Catalyst web framework. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Cuff A.L.","Sillitoe I.","Lewis T.","Clegg A.B.","Rentzsch R.","Furnham N.","Pellegrini-Calace M.","Jones D.","Thornton J.","Orengo C.A."],"cit_count":110,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21097779","title":"Extending CATH: Increasing coverage of the protein structure universe and linking structure with function","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cath","biotoolsID":"cath","description":"CATH is a manually curated classification of protein domain structures. Each protein has been chopped into structural domains and assigned into homologous superfamilies (groups of domains that are related by evolution).
