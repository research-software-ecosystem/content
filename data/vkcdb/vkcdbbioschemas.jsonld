  "sc:description": "The Voltage-gated K(+) Channel DataBase contains full-length or nearly full-length unique channel sequences from Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryotes. Corresponding nucleotide sequences of the open reading frames corresponding to the amino acid sequences are now available and can be extracted in parallel with sets of protein sequences. Channels are categorized into subfamilies by phylogenetic analysis and by using hidden Markov model analyses.",
