However, previous approaches for sequencing cDNA clones were expensive or time-consuming, and therefore, a fast and efficient sequencing approach was demanded. Methodology: We developed a program, MuSICA 2, that assembles millions of short (36-nucleotide) reads collected from a single flow cell lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer to shotgun-sequence ~800 human full-length cDNA clones. MuSICA 2 performs a hybrid assembly in which an external de novo assembler is run first and the result is then improved by reference alignment of shotgun reads. We compared the MuSICA 2 assembly with 200 pooled full-length cDNA clones finished independently by the conventional primer-walking using Sanger sequencers. The exon-intron structure of the coding sequence was correct for more than 95% of the clones with coding sequence annotation when we excluded cDNA clones insufficiently represented in the shotgun library due to PCR failure (42 out of 200 clones excluded), and the nucleotide-level accuracy of coding sequences of those correct clones was over 99.99%. We also applied MuSICA 2 to full-length cDNA clones from Toxoplasma gondii, to confirm that its ability was competent even for non-human species. Conclusions: The entire sequencing and shotgun assembly takes less than 1 week and the consumables cost only ~US$3 per clone, demonstrating a significant advantage over previous approaches. \u00a9 2010 Kuroshu et al.", "citationCount": 11, "authors": [{"name": "Kuroshu R.M."}, {"name": "Watanabe J."}, {"name": "Sugano S."}, {"name": "Morishita S."}, {"name": "Suzuki Y."}, {"name": "Kasahara M."}], "date": "2010-09-14T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Reginaldo Kuroshu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "reginaldo@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Masahiro Kasahara", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mkasa@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yutaka Suzuki", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ysuzuki@k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Shin-ichi Morishita", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "moris@cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:musica_2", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://musica.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Assembles millions of short (36-nucleotide) reads collected from a single flow cell lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer to shotgun-sequence ~800 human full-length cDNA clones.", "toolType": ["Workflow"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "musica_2", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:15:36Z", "name": "MuSICA 2", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://musica.gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/MuSICA-2.1.0.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
