      "sc:description": "High-throughput analysis of bacterial ribosome profiling data.\n\nHigh-throughput annotation by Ribo-seq.\n\nWe present HRIBO (High-throughput annotation by Ribo-seq), a workflow to enable reproducible and high-throughput analysis of bacterial Ribo-seq data. The workflow performs all required pre-processing steps and quality control. Importantly, HRIBO outputs annotation-independent ORF predictions based on two complementary prokaryotic-focused tools, and integrates them with additional computed features. This facilitates both the rapid discovery of ORFs and their prioritization for functional characterization.",
