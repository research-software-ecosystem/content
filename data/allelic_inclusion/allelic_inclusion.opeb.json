We develop and experimentally validate a statistical inference model in order to accurately estimate the rate of ααβ and αββ allelic inclusion T cells. Our results show that approximately 15% of T cells express more than one unique TCR and suggest that these allelic inclusion cells represent a functionally important component of the human TCR repertoire. © 2019A small population of αβ T cells is characterized by the expression of more than one unique T cell receptor (TCR); this outcome is the result of “allelic inclusion,” that is, inclusion of both α- or β-chain alleles during V(D)J recombination. Limitations in single-cell sequencing technology, however, have precluded comprehensive enumeration of these dual receptor T cells. Here, we develop and experimentally validate a fully Bayesian inference model capable of reliably estimating the true rate of α and β TCR allelic inclusion across two different emulsion-barcoding single-cell sequencing platforms. We provide a database composed of over 51,000 previously unpublished allelic inclusion TCR sequence sets drawn from eight healthy individuals and show that allelic inclusion contributes a distinct and functionally important set of sequences to the human TCR repertoire. This database and a Python implementation of our statistical inference model are freely available at our Github repository (https://github.com/JasonACarter/Allelic_inclusion).","authors":["Carter J.A.","Preall J.B.","Atwal G.S."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1016/J.CELS.2019.09.006","journal":"Cell Systems","pmid":"31677971","title":"Bayesian Inference of Allelic Inclusion Rates in the Human T Cell Receptor Repertoire","year":"2019-11-27"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:allelic_inclusion","biotoolsID":"allelic_inclusion","description":"Bayesian Inference of Allelic Inclusion Rates in the Human T Cell Receptor Repertoire.\n\nInferring T cell allelic inclusion rates.\n\nCarter, J.A., Preall, J.B., and Atwal, G.S.
