MySeq is intended for use as a genomics educational platform.\n\nAnalyzing the PTC Tasting Phenotype with MySeq.\n\nThis page is an example analysis of the \"bitter tasting\" trait using the MySeq application in an embedded context. Here MySeq is used to both query a whole genome VCF for NA12878 (from Genome in a Bottle) by genomic coordinates and predict the bitter tasting phenotype directly. All of the queries demonstrated here are performed \"live\" in the browser, that is these are not pre-generated results.
