                "abstract": "Analyzing and visualizing the tertiary structure and complex interactions of RNA is essential for being able to mechanistically decipher their molecular functions in vivo. Secondary structure visualization software can portray many aspects of RNA; however, these layouts are often unable to preserve topological correspondence since they do not consider tertiary interactions between different regions of an RNA molecule. Likewise, quaternary interactions between two or more interacting RNA molecules are not considered in secondary structure visualization tools. The RNAscape webserver produces visualizations that can preserve topological correspondence while remaining both visually intuitive and structurally insightful. RNAscape achieves this by designing a mathematical structural mapping algorithm which prioritizes the helical segments, reflecting their tertiary organization. Non-helical segments are mapped in a way that minimizes structural clutter. RNAscape runs a plotting script that is designed to generate publication-quality images. RNAscape natively supports non-standard nucleotides, multiple base-pairing annotation styles and requires no programming experience. RNAscape can also be used to analyze RNA/DNA hybrid structures and DNA topologies, including G-quadruplexes. Users can upload their own three-dimensional structures or enter a Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID of an existing structure. The RNAscape webserver allows users to customize visualizations through various settings as desired. URL: https://rnascape.usc.edu/.",
