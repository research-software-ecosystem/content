  "sc:description": "CorreLogo generates a 3D sequence logo for RNA or DNA alignments. The first two dimensions of the sequence logo display information about the information content and residue composition of individual columns of the alignment.  The 3D sequence logo consists of a square matrix that shows columns with high mutual information, a measure of how much the residues in two alignment columns are correlated.",
