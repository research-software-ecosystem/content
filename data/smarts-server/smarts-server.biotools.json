    "description": "the social media-based addiction recovery and intervention targeting server.\n\nMOTIVATION:Substance abuse and addiction is a significant contemporary health crisis. Modeling its epidemiology and designing effective interventions requires real-time data analysis along with the means to contextualize addiction patterns across the individual-to-community scale. In this context, social media platforms have begun to receive significant attention as a novel source of real-time user-reported information. However, the ability of epidemiologists to use such information is significantly stymied by the lack of publicly available algorithms and software for addiction information extraction, analysis and modeling. RESULTS:SMARTS is a public, open source, web-based application that addresses the aforementioned deficiency.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/smarts",
