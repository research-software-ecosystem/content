      "sc:description": "Ultra-efficient mapping-free structural variant genotyper.\n\nNebula is an ultra-efficient mapping-free structural variation genotyper based on kmer counting.\n\nNebula is a mapping-free approach for accurate and efficient genotyping of SVs. Nebula is a two-stage approach and consists of a kmer extraction phase and a genotyping phase. Given as input a set of SV coordinates (BED/VCF), the reference assembly (FASTA), and a set of mapped samples on which the genotype of these SVs is already known, Nebula extracts a collection of kmers that represent the input SVs (kmer extraction phase) and these extracted kmers will then be used to genotype the same set of SVs on any new WGS sample(s) without the need to map the reads to the reference genome (genotyping phase). This is done by counting the kmers in the WGS reads of the new sample(s) and predicting genotypes using a likelihood model.",
