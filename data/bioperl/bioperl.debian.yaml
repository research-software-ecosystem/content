description: "The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational\
  \ methods routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard CPAN-style, well-documented,\
  \ and freely available Perl modules. It is well-accepted throughout the community\
  \ and used in many high-profile projects, e.g., Ensembl. . The recommended packages\
  \ are needed to run some of the included binaries, for a detailed explanation including\
  \ the specific Perl modules please see README.Debian. . The suggested package enhances\
  \ the manual pages.\n"
