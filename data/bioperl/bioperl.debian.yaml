   The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational methods
   routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard CPAN-style,
   well-documented, and freely available Perl modules. It is well-accepted
   throughout the community and used in many high-profile projects, e.g.,
   Ensembl.
