      "sc:description": "Linesink-maker is a tool for rapid construction of streamflow routing networks from hydrography data. Nearfield (highest resultion), mid-field and farfield (least resolution, zero resistance) areas of a desired stream network can be defined by polygon shapefiles. The LinesinkData are then created from NHDPlus hydrography. The number of resulting linesink equations (level of detail) in the various areas of the stream network can be controlled by a distance tolerance parameter specified by geographic area (defined by one of the polygons).",
