Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: In practice, identifying and interpreting the functional impacts of the regulatory relationships between micro-RNA and messenger-RNA is non-trivial. The sheer scale of possible micro-RNA and messenger-RNA interactions can make the interpretation of results difficult. Results: We propose a supervised framework, pMim, built upon concepts of significance combination, for jointly ranking regulatory micro-RNA and their potential functional impacts with respect to a condition of interest. Here, pMim directly tests if a micro-RNA is differentially expressed and if its predicted targets, which lie in a common biological pathway, have changed in the opposite direction. We leverage the information within existing micro-RNA target and pathway databases to stabilize the estimation and annotation of micro-RNA regulation making our approach suitable for datasets with small sample sizes. In addition to outputting meaningful and interpretable results, we demonstrate in a variety of datasets that the micro-RNA identified by pMim, in comparison to simpler existing approaches, are also more concordant with what is described in the literature.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Patrick E."}, {"name": "Buckley M."}, {"name": "Muller S."}, {"name": "Lin D.M."}, {"name": "Yang J.Y.H."}], "date": "2015-02-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ellispatrick.com/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "epatrick1@bwh.harvard.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sydseq", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ellispatrick.com/r-packages/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An R package containing the functions exClust, TshrinkPlus and pMim.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/sydseq-various-functions-for-gene-expression-analysis.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "sydseq", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:08:29Z", "name": "sydSeq", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ellispatrick.com/r-packages/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
