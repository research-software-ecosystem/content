Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: In practice, identifying and interpreting the functional impacts of the regulatory relationships between micro-RNA and messenger-RNA is non-trivial. The sheer scale of possible micro-RNA and messenger-RNA interactions can make the interpretation of results difficult. Results: We propose a supervised framework, pMim, built upon concepts of significance combination, for jointly ranking regulatory micro-RNA and their potential functional impacts with respect to a condition of interest. Here, pMim directly tests if a micro-RNA is differentially expressed and if its predicted targets, which lie in a common biological pathway, have changed in the opposite direction. We leverage the information within existing micro-RNA target and pathway databases to stabilize the estimation and annotation of micro-RNA regulation making our approach suitable for datasets with small sample sizes. In addition to outputting meaningful and interpretable results, we demonstrate in a variety of datasets that the micro-RNA identified by pMim, in comparison to simpler existing approaches, are also more concordant with what is described in the literature.","authors":["Patrick E.","Buckley M.","Muller S.","Lin D.M.","Yang J.Y.H."],"cit_count":2,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25910695","title":"Inferring data-specific micro-RNA function through the joint ranking of micro-RNA and pathways from matched micro-RNA and gene expression data","year":"2015-02-06"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sydseq","biotoolsID":"sydseq","description":"An R package containing the functions exClust, TshrinkPlus and pMim.","homepage":"http://www.ellispatrick.com/r-packages/","name":"sydSeq"}}
