Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: High throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) contact matrices are used to predict 3D chromatin structures in eukaryotic cells. High-resolution Hi-C data are less available than low-resolution Hi-C data due to sequencing costs but provide greater insight into the intricate details of 3D chromatin structures such as enhancer-promoter interactions and sub-domains. To provide a cost-effective solution to high-resolution Hi-C data collection, deep learning models are used to predict high-resolution Hi-C matrices from existing low-resolution matrices across multiple cell types. Results: Here, we present two Cascading Residual Networks called HiCARN-1 and HiCARN-2, a convolutional neural network and a generative adversarial network, that use a novel framework of cascading connections throughout the network for Hi-C contact matrix prediction from low-resolution data. Shown by image evaluation and Hi-C reproducibility metrics, both HiCARN models, overall, outperform state-of-The-Art Hi-C resolution enhancement algorithms in predictive accuracy for both human and mouse 1/16, 1/32, 1/64 and 1/100 downsampled high-resolution Hi-C data. Also, validation by extracting topologically associating domains, chromosome 3D structure and chromatin loop predictions from the enhanced data shows that HiCARN can proficiently reconstruct biologically significant regions.",
