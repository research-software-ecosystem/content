Published by Oxford University Press._tit.Motivation: A phylogenetic tree reconciliation is a mapping of one phylogenetic tree onto another which represents the co-evolution of two sets of taxa (e.g. parasite-host co-evolution, gene-species co-evolution). The reconciliation framework was extended to allow modeling the co-evolution of three sets of taxa such as transcript-gene-species co-evolutions. Several web-based tools have been developed for the display and manipulation of phylogenetic trees and co-phylogenetic trees involving two trees, but there currently exists no tool for visualizing the joint reconciliation between three phylogenetic trees. Results: Here, we present DoubleRecViz, a web-based tool for visualizing double reconciliations between phylogenetic trees at three levels: transcript, gene and species. DoubleRecViz extends the RecPhyloXML model-developed for gene-species tree reconciliation-to represent joint transcript-gene and gene-species tree reconciliations. It is implemented using the Dash library, which is a toolbox that provides dynamic visualization functionalities for web data visualization in Python. Availability and implementation: DoubleRecViz is available through a web server at https://doublerecviz.cobius.ush erbrooke.ca. The source code and information about installation procedures are also available at https://github.com/ UdeS-CoBIUS/DoubleRecViz.",
