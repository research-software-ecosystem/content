However, the potential of scRNA-seq for new discoveries is constrained by the robustness of subsequent data analysis. Here we propose a robust model, BCseq (bias-corrected sequencing analysis), to accurately quantify gene expression from scRNA-seq. BCseq corrects inherent bias of scRNA-seq in a data-adaptive manner and effectively removes technical noise. BCseq rescues dropouts through weighted consideration of similar cells. Cells with higher sequencing depths contribute more to the quantification nonlinearly. Furthermore, BCseq assigns a quality score for the expression of each gene in each cell, providing users an objective measure to select genes for downstream analysis. In comparison to existing scRNA-seq methods, BCseq demonstrates increased robustness in detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes and cell subtype classification.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Chen L."}, {"name": "Zheng S."}], "date": "2018-08-21T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": [], "name": "Liang Chen", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": null, "email": "liangche@usc.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bcseq_bias", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~liangche/software.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA-Seq analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3680"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-03T21:43:18Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for quantifying gene expression from single cell RNA-seq.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "bcseq_bias", "additionDate": "2019-02-03T21:42:55Z", "name": "BCseq (bias-corrected sequencing analysis)", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
