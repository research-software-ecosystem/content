Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of cell lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing - from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data. Results In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a 'multiple time point' mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.","authors":["Zhao L.","Liu Z.","Levy S.F.","Wu S."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx655","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Bartender: A fast and accurate clustering algorithm to count barcode reads","year":"2018-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:bartender","biotoolsID":"bartender","description":"Fast and accurate clustering algorithm to count barcode reads.","homepage":"https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1","name":"Bartender","version":["1.1"]}}
