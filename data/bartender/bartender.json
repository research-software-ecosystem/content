Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation Barcode sequencing (bar-seq) is a high-throughput, and cost effective method to assay large numbers of cell lineages or genotypes in complex cell pools. Because of its advantages, applications for bar-seq are quickly growing - from using neutral random barcodes to study the evolution of microbes or cancer, to using pseudo-barcodes, such as shRNAs or sgRNAs to simultaneously screen large numbers of cell perturbations. However, the computational pipelines for bar-seq clustering are not well developed. Available methods often yield a high frequency of under-clustering artifacts that result in spurious barcodes, or over-clustering artifacts that group distinct barcodes together. Here, we developed Bartender, an accurate clustering algorithm to detect barcodes and their abundances from raw next-generation sequencing data. Results In contrast with existing methods that cluster based on sequence similarity alone, Bartender uses a modified two-sample proportion test that also considers cluster size. This modification results in higher accuracy and lower rates of under- and over-clustering artifacts. Additionally, Bartender includes unique molecular identifier handling and a 'multiple time point' mode that matches barcode clusters between different clustering runs for seamless handling of time course data. Bartender is a set of simple-to-use command line tools that can be performed on a laptop at comparable run times to existing methods.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Zhao L."}, {"name": "Liu Z."}, {"name": "Levy S.F."}, {"name": "Wu S."}], "date": "2018-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Sasha Levy", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sasha.levy@stonybrook.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Song Wu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "song.wu@stonybrook.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bartender", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0291"}, {"term": "Community profiling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3200"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast and accurate clustering algorithm to count barcode reads.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "bartender", "additionDate": "2018-06-21T15:50:35Z", "name": "Bartender", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/LaoZZZZZ/bartender-1.1", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
