    "description": "Unsupervised Rotation Factorization in Restricted Boltzmann Machines.\n\nFinding suitable image representations for the task at hand is critical in computer vision. Different approaches extending the original Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model have recently been proposed to offer rotation-invariant feature learning. In this paper, we present an extended novel RBM that learns rotation invariant features by explicitly factorizing for rotation nuisance in 2D image inputs within an unsupervised framework. While the goal is to learn invariant features, our model infers an orientation per input image during training, using information related to the reconstruction error. The training process is regularised by a Kullback-Leibler divergence, offering stability and consistency.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/rbm",
