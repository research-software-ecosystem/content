However, considering in the analysis only those peptides that could be detected by mass spectrometry (MS), also called proteotypic peptides, increases the accuracy of the results. Several approaches have been applied to predict peptide detectability based on the physicochemical properties of the peptides. In this manuscript we present DeepMSPeptide, a bioinformatic tool that uses a deep learning method to predict proteotypic peptides exclusively based on the peptide amino acid sequences","homepage":"https://github.com/vsegurar/DeepMSPeptide","name":"DeepMSPeptide"}}
