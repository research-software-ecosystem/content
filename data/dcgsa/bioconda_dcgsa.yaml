description: Distance-correlation based Gene Set Analysis for longitudinal gene expression
  profiles. In longitudinal studies, the gene expression profiles were collected at
  each visit from each subject and hence there are multiple measurements of the gene
  expression profiles for each subject. The dcGSA package could be used to assess
  the associations between gene sets and clinical outcomes of interest by fully taking
  advantage of the longitudinal nature of both the gene expression profiles and clinical
  outcomes.
