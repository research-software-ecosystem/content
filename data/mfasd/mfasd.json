Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: A large number of proteins contain metal ions that are essential for their stability and biological activity. Identifying and characterizing metal-binding sites through computational methods is necessary when experimental clues are lacking. Almost all published computational methods are designed to distinguish metal-binding sites from non-metal-binding sites. However, discrimination between different types of metal-binding sites is also needed to make more accurate predictions. Results: In this work, we proposed a novel algorithm called mFASD, which could discriminate different types of metal-binding sites effectively based on 3D structure data and is useful for accurate metal-binding site prediction. mFASD captures the characteristics of a metal-binding site by investigating the local chemical environment of a set of functional atoms that are considered to be in contact with the bound metal. Then a distance measure defined on functional atom sets enables the comparison between different metal-binding sites. The algorithm could discriminate most types of metal-binding sites from each other with high sensitivity and accuracy. We showed that cascading our method with existing ones could achieve a substantial improvement of the accuracy for metal-binding site prediction.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "He W."}, {"name": "Liang Z."}, {"name": "Teng M."}, {"name": "Niu L."}], "date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Zhi Liang", "url": "http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liangzhi/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "liangzhi@ustc.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mfasd", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liangzhi/mfasd/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool could discriminate different types of metal-binding sites effectively based on 3D structure data and is useful for accurate metal-binding site prediction.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mfasd-discriminating-different-types-of-metal-binding-sites.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mfasd", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:06:46Z", "name": "mFASD", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~liangzhi/mfasd/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
