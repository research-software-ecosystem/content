A reliable metric for quantifying residue conservation is desirable. Over the last two decades many such scores have been proposed, but none has emerged as a generally accepted standard. This work surveys the range of scores that biologists, biochemists, and, more recently, bioinformatics workers have developed, and reviews the intrinsic problems associated with developing and evaluating such a score. A general formula is proposed that may be used to compare the properties of different particular conservation scores or as a measure of conservation in its own right. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","authors":["Valdar W.S.J."],"cit_count":396,"doi":"10.1002/prot.10146","journal":"Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics","title":"Scoring residue conservation","type":"Primary","year":"2002-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:scorecons","biotoolsID":"scorecons","description":"A program to score residue conservation in a multiple sequence alignment.","homepage":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/valdar/scorecons_server.pl","name":"Scorecons","version":["1"]}}
