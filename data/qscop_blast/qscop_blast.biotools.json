                "abstract": "QSCOP is a quantitative structural classification of proteins which distinguishes itself from other classifications by two essential properties: (i) QSCOP is concurrent with the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank and (ii) QSCOP covers the widely used SCOP classification with layers of quantitative structural information. The QSCOPBLAST web server presented here combines the BLAST sequence search engine with QSCOP to retrieve, for a given query sequence, all structural information currently available. The resulting search engine is reliable in terms of the quality of results obtained, and it is efficient in that results are displayed instantaneously. The hierarchical organization of QSCOP is used to control the redundancy and diversity of the retrieved hits with the benefit that the often cumbersome and difficult interpretation of search results is an intuitive and straightforward exercise. We demonstrate the use of QSCOP-BLAST by example. The server is accessible at http://qscop-blast.services.came. sbg.ac.at/. © 2007 The Author(s).",
