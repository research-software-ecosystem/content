description: A package to identify very short IBD segments in large sequencing data
  by FABIA biclustering. Two haplotypes are identical by descent (IBD) if they share
  a segment that both inherited from a common ancestor. Current IBD methods reliably
  detect long IBD segments because many minor alleles in the segment are concordant
  between the two haplotypes. However, many cohort studies contain unrelated individuals
  which share only short IBD segments. This package provides software to identify
  short IBD segments in sequencing data. Knowledge of short IBD segments are relevant
  for phasing of genotyping data, association studies, and for population genetics,
  where they shed light on the evolutionary history of humans. The package supports
  VCF formats, is based on sparse matrix operations, and provides visualization of
  haplotype clusters in different formats.
