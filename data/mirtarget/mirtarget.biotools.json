    "description": "miRTARGET is an integrated web tool for the identification of microRNA targets with potential therapeutic or prognostic value in cancer. The target prediction is based on four dataset categories: mRNA profiling in cells or mice after (1) ectopic miRNA expression or (2) miRNA inactivation by knock-out or knock-down, (3) correlation analyses of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles, and (4) ten computational miRNA target prediction algorithms.",
