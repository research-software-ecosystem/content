description: 'The sva package contains functions for removing batch effects and other
  unwanted variation in high-throughput experiment. Specifically, the sva package
  contains functions for the identifying and building surrogate variables for high-dimensional
  data sets. Surrogate variables are covariates constructed directly from high-dimensional
  data (like gene expression/RNA sequencing/methylation/brain imaging data) that can
  be used in subsequent analyses to adjust for unknown, unmodeled, or latent sources
  of noise. The sva package can be used to remove artifacts in three ways: (1) identifying
  and estimating surrogate variables for unknown sources of variation in high-throughput
  experiments (Leek and Storey 2007 PLoS Genetics,2008 PNAS), (2) directly removing
  known batch effects using ComBat (Johnson et al. 2007 Biostatistics) and (3) removing
  batch effects with known control probes (Leek 2014 biorXiv). Removing batch effects
  and using surrogate variables in differential expression analysis have been shown
  to reduce dependence, stabilize error rate estimates, and improve reproducibility,
