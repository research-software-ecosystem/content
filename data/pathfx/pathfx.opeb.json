A contemporary patient population.\n\nOpen source architecture powered by the International Bone Metastasis Registry.\n\nWe’ve upgraded PATHFx using more contemporary patients, in an effort to modernize the models. We designed the open source PATHFx tool to better integrate with providers, electronic health records, registries and other industry databases. Our machine-learning code, created in-house specifically for PATHFx, allows for greater compatibility and collaboration, while also enabling us to streamline the evolution of new models.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BACKGROUND:PATHFx', 'PATHFx version 3.0'","homepage":"https://www.pathfx.org","name":"PATHFx"}}
