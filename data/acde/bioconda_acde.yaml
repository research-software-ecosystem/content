description: This package provides a multivariate inferential analysis method for
  detecting differentially expressed genes in gene expression data. It uses artificial
  components, close to the data's principal components but with an exact interpretation
  in terms of differential genetic expression, to identify differentially expressed
  genes while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). The methods on this package
  are described in the vignette or in the article 'Multivariate Method for Inferential
  Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes in Gene Expression Experiments'
  by J. P. Acosta, L. Lopez-Kleine and S. Restrepo (2015, pending publication).
