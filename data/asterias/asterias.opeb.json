Access to, and further analysis of, additional biological information and annotations (PubMed references, Gene Ontology terms, KEGG and Reactome pathways) are available either for individual genes (from clickable links in tables and figures) or sets of genes. These applications cover from array normalization to imputation and preprocessing, differential gene expression analysis, class and survival prediction and aCGH analysis. The source code is available, allowing for extention and reuse of the software. The links and analysis of additional functional information, parallelization of computation and open-source availability of the code make Asterias a unique suite that can exploit features specific to web-based environments. © 2007 The Author(s).","authors":["Diaz-Uriarte R.","Alibes A.","Morrissey E.R.","Canada A.","Rueda O.M.","Neves M.L."],"cit_count":13,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"17488846","title":"Asterias: Integrated analysis of expression and aCGH data using an open-source, web-based, parallelized software suite","year":"2007-07-01"},{"abstract":"Summary: We present a web server for Diagnosis and Normalization of MicroArray Data (DNMAD).

Many gene selection approaches use univariate (gene-by-gene) rankings of gene relevance and arbitrary thresholds to select the number of genes, can only be applied to two-class problems, and use gene selection ranking criteria unrelated to the classification algorithm. In contrast, random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance. Thus, it is important to understand the performance of random forest with microarray data and its possible use for gene selection. Results: We investigate the use of random forest for classification of microarray data (including multi-class problems) and propose a new method of gene selection in classification problems based on random forest. Using simulated and nine microarray data sets we show that random forest has comparable performance to other classification methods, including DLDA, KNN, and SVM, and that the new gene selection procedure yields very small sets of genes (often smaller than alternative methods) while preserving predictive accuracy. Conclusions: Because of its performance and features, random forest and gene selection using random forest should probably become part of the \"standard tool-box\" of methods for class prediction and gene selection with microarray data. © 2006 Diaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andres, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Diaz-Uriarte R.","Alvarez de Andres S."],"cit_count":1325,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pmid":"16398926","title":"Gene selection and classification of microarray data using random forest","year":"2006-01-06"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:asterias","biotoolsID":"asterias","description":"Set of tools for the analyses of high throughput genomic data that includes applications for microarray data normalization, filtering, detection of differential gene expression, class and survival prediction model building, and analysis of array CGH data.
