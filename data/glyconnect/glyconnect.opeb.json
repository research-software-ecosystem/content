            "abstract": "Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society.Knowledge of glycoproteins, their site-specific glycosylation patterns, and the glycan structures that they present to their recognition partners in health and disease is gradually being built on using a range of experimental approaches. The data from these analyses are increasingly being standardized and presented in various sources, from supplemental tables in publications to localized servers in investigator laboratories. Bioinformatics tools are now needed to collect these data and enable the user to search, display, and connect glycomics and glycoproteomics to other sources of related proteomics, genomics, and interactomics information. We here introduce GlyConnect (https://glyconnect.expasy.org/), the central platform of the Glycomics@ExPASy portal for glycoinformatics. GlyConnect has been developed to gather, monitor, integrate, and visualize data in a user-friendly way to facilitate the interpretation of collected glycoscience data. GlyConnect is designed to accommodate and integrate multiple data types as they are increasingly produced.",
