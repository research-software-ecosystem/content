    "description": "Crowd Analytics for Medical Imaging Data.\n\nWe present a visual analytics framework, CMed, for exploring medical image data annotations acquired from crowdsourcing. CMed can be used to visualize, classify, and filter crowdsourced clinical data based on a number of different metrics such as detection rate, logged events, and clustering of the annotations. CMed provides several interactive linked visualization components to analyze the crowd annotation results for a particular video and the associated workers. Additionally, all results of an individual worker can be inspected using multiple linked views in our CMed framework. We allow a crowdsourcing application analyst to observe patterns and gather insights into the crowdsourced medical data, helping him her design future crowdsourcing applications for optimal output from the workers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
