                "abstract": "Top-down proteomics studies intact proteins, enabling new opportunities for analyzing post-translational modifications. Because tandem mass spectra of intact proteins are very complex, spectral deconvolution (grouping peaks into isotopomer envelopes) is a key initial stage for their interpretation. In such spectra, isotopomer envelopes of different protein fragments span overlapping regions on the m/z axis and even share spectral peaks. This raises both pattern recognition and combinatorial challenges for spectral deconvolution. We present MS-Deconv, a combinatorial algorithm for spectral deconvolution. The algorithm first generates a large set of candidate isotopomer envelopes for a spectrum, then represents the spectrum as a graph, and finally selects its highest scoring subset of envelopes as a heaviest path in the graph. In contrast with other approaches, the algorithm scores sets of envelopes rather than individual envelopes. We demonstrate that MS-Deconv improves on Thrash and Xtract in the number of correctly recovered monoisotopic masses and speed. We applied MS-Deconv to a large set of top-down spectra from Yersinia rohdei (with a still unsequenced genome) and further matched them against the protein database of related and sequenced bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. MS-Deconv is available at http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/Software.html. \u00a9 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",
