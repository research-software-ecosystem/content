The DAS protocol allows us to gather layers of annotation data for a given sequence and thereby gain an overview of the sequence's features. A user-friendly graphical client has also been developed (http://www.cbs. dtu.dk/cgi-bin/das), which demonstrates the possibility of integrating DAS annotation data from multiple sources into a simple graphical view. The client displays protein feature annotations from the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis as well as from the BioSapiens reference UniProt server (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/das-srv/uniprot/das) at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Other DAS data sources for protein annotation will be added as they become available. © 2005 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Olason P.I."],"cit_count":13,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15980514","title":"Integrating protein annotation resources through the Distributed Annotation System","year":"2005-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cbs_das_protein_viewer","biotoolsID":"cbs_das_protein_viewer","description":"Protein viewer which uses the distributed annotation system (DAS) to integrate and present annotation data from multiple sources for a protein sequence.","homepage":"http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/proview/view_encode?id=Z69720.1-001","name":"CBS DAS protein viewer"}}
