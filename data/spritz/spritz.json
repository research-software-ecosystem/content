Porter relies on bidirectional recurrent neural networks with shortcut connections, accurate coding of input profiles obtained from multiple sequence alignments, second stage filtering by recurrent neural networks, incorporation of long range information and large-scale ensembles of predictors. Porter's accuracy, tested by rigorous 5-fold cross-validation on a large set of proteins, exceeds 79%, significantly above a copy of the state-of-the-art SSpro server, better than any system published to date. \u00a9 The Author 2004.

The prediction of intrinsically disordered regions in proteins from sequence is increasingly becoming of interest, as the presence of many such regions in the complete genome sequences are discovered and important functional roles are associated with them. We have developed a machine learning approach based on two support vector machines (SVM) to discriminate disordered regions from sequence. The SVM are trained and benchmarked on two sets, representing long and short disordered regions. A preliminary version of Spritz was shown to perform consistently well at the recent biannual CASP-6 experiment [Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP), 2004]. The fully developed Spritz method is freely available as a web server at http://distill.ucd.ie/spritz/ and http://protein.cribi.unipd.it/spritz/. \u00a9 The Author 2006.
