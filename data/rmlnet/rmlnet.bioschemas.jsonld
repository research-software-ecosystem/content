      "sc:description": "Reliable Wireless Network for a Multiarea TDOA-Based Localization System.\n\nUltrawideband (UWB) wireless communication is a promising spread-spectrum technology for accurate localization among devices characterized by a low transmission power, a high rate and immunity to multipath propagation. The accurately of the clock synchronization algorithm and the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) localization algorithm provide precise position information of mobile nodes with centimeter-level accuracy for the UWB localization system. However, the reliability of target node localization for multi-area localization remains a subject of research. Especially for dynamic and harsh indoor environments, an effective scheme among competing target nodes for localization due to the scarcity of radio resources remains a challenge.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
