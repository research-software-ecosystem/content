Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: Conserved water molecules play a crucial role in protein structure, stabilization of secondary structure, protein activity, flexibility and ligand binding. Clustering of water molecules in superimposed protein structures, obtained by X-ray crystallography at high resolution, is an established method to identify consensus water molecules in all known protein structures of the same family. PyWATER is an easy-to-use PyMOL plug-in and identifies conserved water molecules in the protein structure of interest. PyWATER can be installed via the user interface of PyMOL. No programming or command-line knowledge is required for its use.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: PyWATER and a tutorial are available at https://github.com/hiteshpatel379/PyWATER. PyMOL is available at http://www.pymol.org/ or http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol/.CONTACT: stefan.guenther@pharmazie.uni-freiburg.de.", "citationCount": 13, "authors": [{"name": "Patel H."}, {"name": "Gruning B.A."}, {"name": "Gunther S."}, {"name": "Merfort I."}], "date": "2014-10-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "stefan.guenther@pharmazie.uni-freiburg.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pywater", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/hiteshpatel379/PyWATER", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "PyMOL plugin to find conserved water molecules in X-ray protein structure.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pywater-1-0-find-conserved-water-molecules-in-proteins-by-clustering.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "pywater", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:56:55Z", "name": "PyWATER", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/hiteshpatel379/PyWATER/blob/master/README.rst", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
