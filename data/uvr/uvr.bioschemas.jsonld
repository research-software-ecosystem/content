The goal of this study was to analyze the capacity of high-mountain Espeletia hartwegiana plant phyllosphere microorganisms to survive UVR and to identify genes related to resistance strategies. A strain of Deinococcus swuensis showed a high survival rate of up to 60% after UVR treatment at 800 J m 2 and was used for differential expression analysis using RNA-seq after exposing cells to 400 J m 2 of UVR (with > 95% survival rate)",
