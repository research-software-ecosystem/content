  "sc:description": "Provides information about mechanostability of proteins. Its core is based on simulations of stretching of proteins within a structure-based model. The primary information is about the heights of the maximal force peaks, the force-displacement patterns, and the sequencing of the contact-rupturing events. Information on the possible types of the mechanical clamps (the motifs which are responsible for a protein's resistance to stretching) are also given.",
