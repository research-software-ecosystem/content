The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use.\n\nAbstractBackgroundThe AHRQ Safety Program for Improving Antibiotic Use aims to improve antibiotic (abx) use in acute, long-term, and outpatient care settings by enhancing abx stewardship programs (ASP) and engaging frontline providers to incorporate stewardship into daily abx decision-making, with an emphasis on viewing appropriate prescribing as a patient safety issue. We report on the impact of implementation of the Acute Care Safety Program on abx use and Clostridioides difficile in a cohort of US hospitals. MethodsThe Acute Care Safety Program was implemented from December 2017 to November 2018. At least one unit from each hospital participated.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'abx', 'difficile LabID', 'LabID', 'abx prescribing'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6809119/","name":"AHRQ"}}
