Unfortunately, it has received very little attention and in fact there is a growing need for software tools/libraries dedicated to it. Here we present ValWorkBench, a software library consisting of eleven well known validation measures, together with novel heuristic approximations for some of them. The main objective of this paper is to provide the interested researcher with the full software documentation of an open source cluster validation platform having the main features of being easily extendible in a homogeneous way and of offering software components that can be readily re-used. Consequently, the focus of the presentation is on the architecture of the library, since it provides an essential map that can be used to access the full software documentation, which is available at the supplementary material website [1]. The mentioned main features of ValWorkBench are also discussed and exemplified, with emphasis on software abstraction design and re-usability. A comparison with existing cluster validation software libraries, mainly in terms of the mentioned features, is also offered. It suggests that ValWorkBench is a much needed contribution to the microarray software development/algorithm engineering community. For completeness, it is important to mention that previous accurate algorithmic experimental analysis of the relative merits of each of the implemented measures [19,23,25], carried out specifically on microarray data, gives useful insights on the effectiveness of ValWorkBench for cluster validation to researchers in the microarray community interested in its use for the mentioned task.","authors":["Giancarlo R.","Scaturro D.","Utro F."],"cit_count":2,"journal":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","pmid":"25582071","title":"ValWorkBench: An open source Java library for cluster validation, with applications to microarray data analysis","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:valworkbench","biotoolsID":"valworkbench","description":"The tool consists of a collection of measures for validation of clustering solutions and algorithms.
