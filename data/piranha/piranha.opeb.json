The goal of functional annotation of sequences in the field of RNA binding is to provide predictions of high accuracy that require only small numbers of targeted mutations for verification. The PiRaNhA server uses a support vector machine (SVM), with position-specific scoring matrices, residue interface propensity, predicted residue accessibility and residue hydrophobicity as features. The server allows the submission of up to 10 protein sequences, and the predictions for each sequence are provided on a web page and via email. The prediction results are provided in sequence format with predicted RBRs highlighted, in text format with the SVM threshold score indicated and as a graph which enables users to quickly identify those residues above any specific SVM threshold. The graph effectively enables the increase or decrease of the false positive rate. When tested on a non-redundant data set of 42 protein sequences not used in training, the PiRaNhA server achieved an accuracy of 85%, specificity of 90% and a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.41 and outperformed other publicly available servers.

Comp-utational function prediction methods are therefore essential as initial steps in the function annotation process. This article describes an annotation method (PiRaNhA) for the prediction of RNA-binding residues (RBRs) from protein sequence information. A series of sequence properties (position specific scoring matrices, interface propensities, predicted accessibility and hydrophobicity) are used to train a support vector machine. This method is then evaluated for its potential to be applied to RNA-binding function prediction at the level of the complete protein. Results: The 5-fold cross-validation of PiRaNhA on a dataset of 81 RNA-binding proteins achieves a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.50 and accuracy of 87.2%. When used to predict RBRs in 42 proteins not used in training, PiRaNhA achieves an MCC of 0.41 and accuracy of 84.5%. Decision values from the PiRaNhA predictions were used in a second SVM to make predictions of RNA-binding function at the protein level, achieving an MCC of 0.53 and accuracy of 76.1%. The PiRaNhA RBR predictions allow experimentalists to perform more targeted experiments for function annotation; and the prediction of RNA-binding function at the protein level shows promise for proteome-wide annotations. © The Author 2009.
