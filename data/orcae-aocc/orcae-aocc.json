The system is build on the wiki philosophy, all modifications to a certain gene are stored and can be found back in the annotation history of that gene. To be able to modify genes however you will need to have a user account. Anonymous users can browse the public genomes but don't have editing rights.\n\nNutrition is at the core of AOCC.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/limani (PSB.UGENT.BE), bio.tools/orcae (BIOINFORMATICS.PSB.UGENT.BE/orcae ; PSB.UGENT.BE/orcae), bio.tools/cornet_arabidopsis (PSB.UGENT.BE)",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.ORCAE (Online Resource for Community Annotation of Eukaryotes) is a public genome annotation curation resource. ORCAE-AOCC is a branch that is dedicated to the genomes published as part of the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC). The motivation behind the development of the ORCAE platform was to create a knowledge-based website where the research-community can make contributions to improve genome annotations. All changes to any given gene-model or gene description are stored, and the entire annotation history can be retrieved. Genomes can either be set to \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201crestricted\u201d mode; anonymous users can browse public genomes but cannot make any changes. Aside from providing a user-friendly interface to view genome annotations, the platform also includes tools and information (such as gene expression evidence) that enables authorized users to edit and validate genome annotations. The ORCAE-AOCC platform will enable various stakeholders from around the world to coordinate their efforts to annotate and study underutilized crops.",
