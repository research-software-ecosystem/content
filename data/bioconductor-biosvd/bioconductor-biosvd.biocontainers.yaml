description: Contains functions to reduce the input data set from the feature x assay
  space to the reduced diagonalized eigenfeature x eigenassay space, with the eigenfeatures
  and eigenassays unique orthonormal superpositions of the features and assays, respectively.
  results of svd applied to the data can subsequently be inspected based on generated
  graphs, such as a heatmap of the eigenfeature x assay matrix and a bar plot with
  the eigenexpression fractions of all eigenfeatures.
