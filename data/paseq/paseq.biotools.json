    "description": "A10 Presence and frequency of M184V mutation in the MOBIDIP trial | AbstractThe MOBIDIP trial evaluated the simplification by protease (PI r) monotherapy for HIV infection versus dual therapy and boosted protease inhibitor plus lamivudine (PI r + 3TC) in controlled patients under second-line regimens. MOBIDIP was interrupted because of a significant number of patients with virological failure (VF) at week 48 (W48) in PI r (33 133, \u223c25%) versus in PI r + 3TC (4 132, \u223c3%). At the time of first-line VF, 96 per cent of patients harbored the M184V mutation. The presence of the M184V mutation was related to a protective effect against VF in the PI r + 3TC arm. We developed a methodology that allows to determine the frequency of M184V I mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained before MOBIDIP simplification",
