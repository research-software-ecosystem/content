Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: High-coverage sequencing data have significant, yet hard to exploit, redundancy. Most FASTQ compressors cannot efficiently compress the DNA stream of large datasets, since the redundancy between overlapping reads cannot be easily captured in the (relatively small) main memory. More interesting solutions for this problem are disk based, where the better of these two, from Cox et al. (2012), is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) and achieves 0.518 bits per base for a 134.0\u2208Gbp human genome sequencing collection with almost 45-fold coverage. Results: We propose overlapping reads compression with minimizers, a compression algorithm dedicated to sequencing reads (DNA only). Our method makes use of a conceptually simple and easily parallelizable idea of minimizers, to obtain 0.317 bits per base as the compression ratio, allowing to fit the 134.0\u2208Gbp dataset into only 5.31\u2208GB of space.", "citationCount": 23, "authors": [{"name": "Grabowski S."}, {"name": "Deorowicz S."}, {"name": "Roguski L."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=home", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:orcom", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=projects&project=orcom&subpage=about", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Formatting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "ORCOM (Overlapping Reads COmpression with Minimizers) is a compressor of sequencing reads.
