Structural equation modeling (SEM) is an important research tool, both for path-based model specification (common in the social sciences) and also for matrix-based models (in heavy use in behavior genetics). We developed umx to give more immediate access, relatively concise syntax and helpful defaults for users in these two broad disciplines. umx supports development, modification and comparison of models, as well as both graphical and tabular outputs. The second major focus of umx, behavior genetic models, is supported via functions implementing standard multigroup twin models. These functions support raw and covariance data, including joint ordinal data, and give solutions for ACE models, including support for covariates, common- and independent-pathway models, and gene \u00d7 environment interaction models. A tutorial site and question forum are also available.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Bates T.C."}, {"name": "Maes H."}, {"name": "Neale M.C."}], "date": "2019-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Twin Research and Human Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Timothy C.
