The input of the MuSiC system consists of a set of protein/DNA/RNA sequences and a set of user-specified constraints, each with a fragment of residue/nucleotide that (approximately) appears in all input sequences. The output of MuSiC is a constrained multiple sequence alignment in which the fragments of the input sequences whose residues/nucleotides exhibit a given degree of similarity to a constraint are aligned together. The current MuSiC system is implemented in Java language and can be accessed via a simple web interface. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",

                "abstract": "RE-MuSiC is a web-based multiple sequence alignment tool that can incorporate biological knowledge about structure, function, or conserved patterns regarding the sequences of interest. It accepts amino acid or nucleic acid sequences and a set of constraints as inputs. The constraints are pattern descriptions, instead of exact positions of fragments to be aligned together. The output is an alignment where for each pattern (constraint), an occurrence on each sequence can be found aligned together with those on the other sequences, in a manner that the overall alignment is optimized. Its predecessor, MuSiC, has been found useful by researchers since its release in 2004. However, it is noticed in applications that the pattern formulation adopted in MuSiC, namely, plain strings allowing mismatches, is not expressive and flexible enough. The constraint formulation adopted in RE-MuSiC is therefore enhanced to be regular expressions, which is convenient in expressing many biologically significant patterns like those collected in the PROSITE database, or structural consensuses that often involve variable ranges between conserved parts. Experiments demonstrate that RE-MuSiC can be used to help predict important residues and locate phylogenetically conserved structural elements.
