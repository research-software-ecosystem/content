It is an open source tool capable of regulating multiple user data access to each dataset to allow multiple users to have their own integrative view of both their unpublished and published datasets, so that the maintenance costs related to supplying each collaborator exclusively with their own private data are significantly reduced. OmicBrowse supports DAS1 imports and exports of annotations to Internet site servers worldwide. We also provide a data-download named OmicDownload server that interactively selects datasets and filters the data on the selected datasets. Our OmicBrowse server has been freely available at http://omicspace.riken.jp/ since its launch in 2003. The OmicBrowse source code is downloadable from http://sourceforge.net/projects/omicbrowse/.","authors":["Matsushima A.","Kobayashi N.","Mochizuki Y.","Ishii M.","Kawaguchi S.","Endo T.A.","Umetsu R.","Makita Y.","Toyoda T."],"cit_count":3,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"19528066","title":"OmicBrowse: A flash-based high-performance graphics interface for genomic resources","year":"2009-08-04"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:omicbrowse","biotoolsID":"omicbrowse","description":"OmicBrowse is a genome browser designed as a scalable system for maintaining numerous genome annotation datasets.
