biotools_id: dnabarcodes
description: The package offers a function to create DNA barcode sets capable of correcting
  insertion, deletion, and substitution errors. Existing barcodes can be analysed
  regarding their minimal, maximal and average distances between barcodes. Finally,
  reads that start with a (possibly mutated) barcode can be demultiplexed, i.e., assigned
  to their original reference barcode.
