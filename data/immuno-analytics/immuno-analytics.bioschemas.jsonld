      "sc:description": "An integrated in silico immuno-genetic analytical platform provides insights into COVID-19 serological and vaccine targets.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 Immunoanalytics platform is an online tool for the visulisation and analysis of multiple genomic and immunoinformatic meta-analyses. The tool combines an extensive epitope mapping and prediction meta-analysis, with an updated variant database (55,944 non-synonymous mutations) based on 16,087 whole genome sequences, and an analysis of human coronavirus homology, combined with up-to-date annotations from the UniProt database. With this tool and the data we have generated, we hope researchers can perform their own further research, whatever it may be.",
