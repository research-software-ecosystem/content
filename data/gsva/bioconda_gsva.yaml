description: Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) is a non-parametric, unsupervised
  method for estimating variation of gene set enrichment through the samples of a
  expression data set. GSVA performs a change in coordinate systems, transforming
  the data from a gene by sample matrix to a gene-set by sample matrix, thereby allowing
  the evaluation of pathway enrichment for each sample. This new matrix of GSVA enrichment
  scores facilitates applying standard analytical methods like functional enrichment,
  survival analysis, clustering, CNV-pathway analysis or cross-tissue pathway analysis,
  in a pathway-centric manner.
