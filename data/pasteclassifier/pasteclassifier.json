    "description": "The PASTEClassifier (Pseudo Agent System for Transposable Elements Classification) is a transposable element (TE) classifier searching for structural features. It browses the whole spectrum of possible classifications at order level using Wicker hierarchical system. It is also able to automatically classify other repeated elements like SSR (Simple Sequence Repeats), rDNA or potential repeated host genes. The output is designed to facilitate manual curation by providing to the biologist all characteristics that have been found on each TE sequence.",
