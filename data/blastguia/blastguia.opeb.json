KGaA, WeinheimMany researchers use BLAST+ software to build databases and perform sequence alignments. However, command-line operations are required and this created a barrier for researchers with weak computer skills. Therefore, we designed BlastGUI, a Local BLAST visualization software based on Python programming language, to enable users to build databases and perform sequence filtering and sequence alignment through a graphical user interface. The operation visualization, automatic sequence filtering, and cross-platform utilization significantly facilitate biological data analysis and information mining.
