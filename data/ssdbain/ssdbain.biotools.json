    "description": "Sample-size determination for the Bayesian t test and Welch's test using the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factor.\n\nThe function SSDttest is used to compute the sample size required per group for the Bayesian t-test and Bayesian Welch's test. The function SSDANOVA and SSDANOVA_robust in the R package SSDbain computes the sample size for the Bayesian ANOVA, Welch's ANOVA, and robust ANOVA.\n\nbain is an abbreviation for BAyesian INformative hypothesis evaluation. It uses the Bayes factor to evaluate hypotheses in a wide variety of statistical models. One example are the hypotheses H1: m1 = m2 = m3, H2: m1 > m2 > m3, and Hu: m1, m2, m3 (no constraints) where m1, m2, and m3 denote the means in an ANOVA model. Another example is the hypothesis H1: b1 > 0, b2 > 0, b1 > b2 and its complement Hc: not H1, where b1 and b2 denote standardized regression coefficients.",

This paper introduces the R package SSDbain, which can be used to determine the sample size needed to evaluate these hypotheses using the approximate adjusted fractional Bayes factor (AAFBF) implemented in the R package bain. Both the Bayesian t test and the Bayesian Welch’s test are available in this R package. The sample size required will be calculated such that the probability that the Bayes factor is larger than a threshold value is at least η if either the null or alternative hypothesis is true. Using the R package SSDbain and/or the tables provided in this paper, psychological researchers can easily determine the required sample size for their experiments.",
