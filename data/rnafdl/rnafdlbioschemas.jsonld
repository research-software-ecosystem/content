  "sc:description": "Highly flexible tool for drawing RNA secondary structures. Secondary structures can be visualized as classical secondary structure plot, circle plot, linear plot or mountain plot. It allows manual editing and several drawing styles, as well as a fully automated conjugate gradients minimization approach to draw more complex structures without user interaction.",
