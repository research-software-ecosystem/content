RNAfdl is slow but capable of producing intersection-free diagrams for ribosome-sized structures, has a graphical user interface for adjustments and produces output in common formats. © The Author 2013.

Secondary structures can be visualized as classical secondary structure plot, circle plot, linear plot or mountain plot. It allows manual editing and several drawing styles, as well as a fully automated conjugate gradients minimization approach to draw more complex structures without user interaction.","homepage":"http://sourceforge.net/projects/rnafdl/","name":"RNAfdl"}}
