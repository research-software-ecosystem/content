      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Application of an Information Technology Tool for the Epidemiological Assessment of Drug Treatment in Older People | BACKGROUND:To improve drug treatment in older people, who often present with multimorbidity and related polypharmacy, the FORTA (Fit fOR The Aged) List was developed via a Delphi consensus procedure. As a patient-in-focus listing approach (PILA), it has been clinically validated (VALFORTA trial). Unlike drug-oriented listing approaches (DOLAs), its application requires knowledge of patients' characteristics, including diagnoses and other details. As a drug list with discrete labels, application of FORTA seems particularly amenable to electronic support. METHODS:An information technology (IT) algorithm was developed to analyze bulk data on International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-coded diseases and Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)-coded drugs",
