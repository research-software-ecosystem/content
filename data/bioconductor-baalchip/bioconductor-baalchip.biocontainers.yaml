description: This package offers functions to process multiple chip-seq bam files
  and detect allele-specific events. computes allele counts at individual variants
  (snps/snvs), implements extensive qc steps to remove problematic variants, and utilizes
  a bayesian framework to identify statistically significant allele-specific events.
  it is able to account for copy number differences between the two alleles, a known
  phenotypical feature of cancer samples.
