                "abstract": "Latent vectors extracted by machine learning (ML) are widely used in data exploration (e.g., t-SNE) but suffer from a lack of interpretability. While previous studies employed disentangled representation learning (DRL) to enable more interpretable exploration, they often overlooked the potential mismatches between the concepts of humans and the semantic dimensions learned by DRL. To address this issue, we propose Drava, a visual analytics system that supports users in 1) relating the concepts of humans with the semantic dimensions of DRL and identifying mismatches, 2) providing feedback to minimize the mismatches, and 3) obtaining data insights from concept-driven exploration. Drava provides a set of visualizations and interactions based on visual piles to help users understand and refine concepts and conduct concept-driven exploration. Meanwhile, Drava employs a concept adaptor model to fine-tune the semantic dimensions of DRL based on user refinement. The usefulness of Drava is demonstrated through application scenarios and experimental validation.",
