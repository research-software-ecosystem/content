Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Survival analyses of gene expression data has been a useful and widely used approach in clinical applications. But, in complex diseases, such as cancer, the identification of survival-associated cell processes - rather than single genes - provides more informative results because the efficacy of survival prediction increases when multiple prognostic features are combined to enlarge the possibility of having druggable targets. Moreover, genome-wide screening in molecular medicine has rapidly grown, providing not only gene expression but also multi-omic measurements such as DNA mutations, methylation, expression, and copy number data. In cancer, virtually all these aberrations can contribute in synergy to pathological processes, and their measurements can improve a patient's outcome and help in diagnosis and treatment decisions. Here, we present MOSClip, an R package implementing a new topological pathway analysis tool able to integrate multi-omic data and look for survival-associated gene modules. MOSClip tests the survival association of dimensionality-reduced multi-omic data using multivariate models, providing graphical devices for management, browsing and interpretation of results. Using simulated data we evaluated MOSClip performance in terms of false positives and false negatives in different settings, while the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset is used as a case study to highlight MOSClip's potential.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Martini P."}, {"name": "Chiogna M."}, {"name": "Calura E."}, {"name": "Romualdi C."}], "date": "2019-08-22T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Paolo Martini", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "paolo.martini@unipd.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:MOSClip", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/cavei/MOSClip", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Post-translation modification site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"}, {"term": "Expression profile pathway mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0533"}, {"term": "Gene methylation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3207"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-10-31T12:05:34Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Multi-Omic and Survival pathway analysis for the identification of survival associated gene and module.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/cavei/MOSClip/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}], "biotoolsID": "MOSClip", "additionDate": "2019-08-09T13:09:29Z", "name": "MOSClip", "license": "AGPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://cavei.github.io/MOSClip/", "note": "Tutorial material", "type": "Training material"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
