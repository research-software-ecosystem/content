    "description": "Application for the visualization and analysis of PhyloChip microarrays. It is a popular 16S rRNA gene microarray for microbial surveys, and has been successfully used to study the microbial diversity of several interesting environments. However, its adoption has been limited by a lack of accessible analysis software. It fills this need and is the first desktop application providing end-to-end PhyloChip analysis.",
