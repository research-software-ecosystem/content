description: Metfrag is a freely available software for the annotation of high precision
  tandem mass spectra of metabolites which is a first and critical step for the identification
  of a molecular structure. candidate molecules of different databases are fragmented
  in silico and matched against mass to charge values. a score calculated using the
  fragment peak matches gives hints to the quality of the candidate spectrum assignment.
