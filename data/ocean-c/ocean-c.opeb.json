By integrating FAIRE-seq and Hi-C, OCEAN-C detects open chromatin interactions enriched by active cis-regulatory elements. We identify more than 10,000 hubs of open chromatin interactions (HOCIs) in human cells, which are mainly active promoters and enhancers bound by many DNA-binding proteins and form interaction networks crucial for gene transcription. In addition to identifying large-scale topological structures, including topologically associated domains and A/B compartments, OCEAN-C can detect HOCI-mediated chromatin interactions that are strongly associated with gene expression, super-enhancers, and broad H3K4me3 domains.","authors":["Li T.","Jia L.","Cao Y.","Chen Q.","Li C."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-018-1430-4","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"OCEAN-C: Mapping hubs of open chromatin interactions across the genome reveals gene regulatory networks","year":"2018-04-24"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ocean-c","biotoolsID":"ocean-c","description":"Mapping hubs of open chromatin interactions across the genome reveals gene regulatory networks.","homepage":"https://github.com/ChengLiLab/OCEAN-C/","name":"OCEAN-C"}}
