      "sc:description": "A Curated ncRNAomics Knowledgebase for Bridging Basic and Clinical Research in Eye Diseases.\n\nNc2Eye, a literature-mined resource of experimentally validated non-coding RNAs in eye diseases.\n\nEye diseases (EDs) represent the disorders affecting visual system, such as retinoblastoma, diabetic retinopathy, etc. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as a large category of functional RNA molecules, have been reported to play a crucial role in EDs. Here, we developed the Nc2Eye database, which contains 7088 experimentally validated ncRNA-ED associations. It covers 4363 ncRNAs involved in 104 kinds of EDs across 8 species through a comprehensive review of more than 2400 published papers. Nc2Eye also gathered 91 high-throughput transcriptome datasets in EDs and normal controls.",
