description: The mauveAligner and progressiveMauve alignment algorithms have been
  implemented as command-line programs included with the downloadable Mauve software.
  When run from the command-line, these programs provide options not yet available
  in the graphical interface. . Mauve is a system for efficiently constructing multiple
  genome alignments in the presence of large-scale evolutionary events such as rearrangement
  and inversion. Multiple genome alignment provides a basis for research into comparative
  genomics and the study of evolutionary dynamics. Aligning whole genomes is a fundamentally
  different problem than aligning short sequences. . Mauve has been developed with
  the idea that a multiple genome aligner should require only modest computational
  resources. It employs algorithmic techniques that scale well in the amount of sequence
  being aligned. For example, a pair of Y. pestis genomes can be aligned in under
  a minute, while a group of 9 divergent Enterobacterial genomes can be aligned in
  a few hours. . Mauve computes and interactively visualizes genome sequence comparisons.
  Using FastA or GenBank sequence data, Mauve constructs multiple genome alignments
  that identify large-scale rearrangement, gene gain, gene loss, indels, and nucleotide
  substutition. . Mauve is developed at the University of Wisconsin.
