    "description": "Echidna is integrated simulations of single-cell immune receptor repertoires and transcriptomes. Single-cell sequencing now enables the recovery of full-length immune repertoires [B cell receptor (BCR) and T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires], in addition to gene expression information. The feature-rich datasets produced from such experiments require extensive and diverse computational analyses, each of which can significantly influence the downstream immunological interpretations, such as clonal selection and expansion. Simulations produce validated standard datasets, where the underlying generative model can be precisely defined and furthermore perturbed to investigate specific questions of interest. Currently, there is no tool that can be used to simulate a comprehensive ground truth single-cell dataset that incorporates both immune receptor repertoires and gene expression.",
