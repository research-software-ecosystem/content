Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Drug response to many diseases varies dramatically due to the complex genomics and functional features and contexts. Cellular diversity of human tissues, especially tumors, is one of the major contributing factors to the different drug response in different samples. With the accumulation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, it is now possible to study the drug response to different treatments at the single cell resolution. Here, we present CeDR Atlas (available at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/cedr), a knowledgebase reporting computational inference of cellular drug response for hundreds of cell types from various tissues. We took advantage of the high-throughput profiling of drug-induced gene expression available through the Connectivity Map resource (CMap) as well as hundreds of scRNA-seq data covering cells from a wide variety of organs/tissues, diseases, and conditions. Currently, CeDR maintains the results for more than 582 single cell data objects for human, mouse and cell lines, including about 140 phenotypes and 1250 tissue-cell combination types. All the results can be explored and searched by keywords for drugs, cell types, tissues, diseases, and signature genes. Overall, CeDR fine maps drug response at cellular resolution and sheds lights on the design of combinatorial treatments, drug resistance and even drug side effects.",
