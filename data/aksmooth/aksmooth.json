It is the only approach that provides a comprehensive picture of the genome-wide DNA methylation profile. However, obtaining a sufficient amount of genome and read coverage typically requires high sequencing costs. Bioinformatics tools can reduce this cost burden by improving the quality of sequencing data. We have developed a statistical method Ajusted Local Kernel Smoother (AKSmooth) that can accurately and efficiently reconstruct the single CpG methylation estimate across the entire methylome using low-coverage bisulfite sequencing (Bi-Seq) data. We demonstrate the AKSmooth performance on the low-coverage (~ 4\u00d7) DNA methylation profiles of three human colon cancer samples and matched controls. Under the best set of parameters, AKSmooth-curated data showed high concordance with the gold standard high-coverage sample (Pearson 0.90), outperforming the popular analogous method. In addition, AKSmooth showed computational efficiency with runtime benchmark over 4.5 times better than the reference tool. To summarize, AKSmooth is a simple and efficient tool that can provide an accurate human colon methylome estimation profile from low-coverage WGBS data.
