    "description": "Calculating Power for the General Linear Multivariate Model With One or More Gaussian Covariates | An R package implementing power and sample size methods for the general linear multivariate model | The rPowerlib package for R (>3.0.0) calculates power for the general linear multivariate model with or without Gaussian covariates | This package is based on the SAS/IML product POWERLIB (http://www.jstatsoft.org/v30/i05) developed by Keith E. Muller and colleagues. At present, the rPowerlib package DOES NOT include the full functionality of POWERLIB. For features such as power confidence intervals and more statistical tests, please try POWERLIB (http://github.com/samplesizeshop/powerlib) or GLIMMPSE (https://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org). Please visit http://SampleSizeShop.org for more information about calculating power and sample size",
