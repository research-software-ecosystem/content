The code for this package was employed in analyses underlying our manuscript in preparation: Transcriptional mechanisms and gene regulatory networks underlying early adipogenesis (this note will be updated upon publication) | primaryTranscriptAnnotation-vignette.pdf | See the vignette and user manual:",
