  "sc:description": "A method that allows for the use of a collection of non-matched normal tissue samples. Our approach uses a non-parametric bootstrap subsampling of the available reference samples to estimate the distribution of read counts from targeted sequencing. As inspired by random forest, this is combined with a procedure that subsamples the amplicons associated with each of the targeted genes. The obtained information allows us to reliably classify the copy number aberrations on the gene level.",
