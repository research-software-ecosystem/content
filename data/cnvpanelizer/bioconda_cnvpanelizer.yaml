description: A method that allows for the use of a collection of non-matched normal
  tissue samples. Our approach uses a non-parametric bootstrap subsampling of the
  available reference samples to estimate the distribution of read counts from targeted
  sequencing. As inspired by random forest, this is combined with a procedure that
  subsamples the amplicons associated with each of the targeted genes. The obtained
  information allows us to reliably classify the copy number aberrations on the gene
  level.
