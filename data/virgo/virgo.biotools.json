    "description": "Provides gene function predictions for yeast and human by constructing a functional linkage network (FLN) from gene expression and molecular interaction data. It then labels genes in the FLN with their annotations from Gene Ontology, and systematically propagates these labels across the FLN in order to predict the functions of unlabelled genes.",

                "abstract": "Dramatic advances in sequencing technology and sophisticated experimental assays that interrogate the cell, combined with the public availability of the resulting data, herald the era of systems biology. However, the biological functions of more than 40% of the genes in sequenced genomes are unknown, posing a fundamental barrier to progress in systems biology. The large scale and diversity of available data requires the development of techniques that can automatically utilize these datasets to make quantified and robust predictions of gene function that can be experimentally verified. We present a service called the VIRtual Gene Ontology (VIRGO) that (i) constructs a functional linkage network (FLN) from gene expression and molecular interaction data, (ii) labels genes in the FLN with their functional annotations in the Gene Ontology and (iii) systematically propagates these labels across the FLN in order to precisely predict the functions of unlabelled genes. VIRGO assigns confidence estimates to predicted functions so that a biologist can prioritize predictions for further experimental study. For each prediction, VIRGO also provides an informative 'propagation diagram' that traces the flow of information in the FLN that led to the prediction.

                "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput biology has catalyzed a remarkable improvement in our ability to identify new genes. A large fraction of newly discovered genes have an unknown functional role, particularly when they are specific to a particular lineage or organism. These genes, currently labeled \"hypothetical,\" might support important biological cell functions and could potentially serve as targets for medical, diagnostic, or pharmacogenomic studies. An important challenge to the scientific community is to associate these newly predicted genes with a biological function that can be validated by experimental screens. In the absence of sequence or structural homology to known genes, we must rely on advanced biotechnological methods, such as DNA chips and protein-protein interaction screens as well as computational techniques to assign putative functions to these genes. In this article, we propose an effective methodology for combining biological evidence obtained in several high-throughput experimental screens and integrating this evidence in a way that provides consistent functional assignments to hypothetical genes. We use the visualization method of propagation diagrams to illustrate the flow of functional evidence that supports the functional assignments produced by the algorithm. Our results contain a number of predictions and furnish strong evidence that integration of functional information is indeed a promising direction for improving the accuracy and robustness of functional genomics.",
