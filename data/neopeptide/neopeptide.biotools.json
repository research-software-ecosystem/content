Discovery and validation of antigens is the key to develop effective anti-cancer vaccines. Neoantigens, arising from somatic mutations in individual cancers, are considered as ideal cancer vaccine targets because of their immunogenicity and lack of expression in normal tissues. However, only few databases support convenient access to these neoantigens for use in vaccines. To address this gap, we developed a web-accessible database, called NeoPeptide, which contains most of the important characteristics of neoantigens (such as mutation site, subunit sequence, major histocompatibility complex restriction) derived from published literature and other immunological resources. NeoPeptide also provides links to resources for further characterization of the novel features of these neoantigens. NeoPeptide will be regularly updated with newly identified and published neoantigens. Our work will help researchers in identifying neoantigens in different cancers and hasten the search for appropriate cancer vaccine candidates.",
