  "sc:description": "Computational tools for the alignment and superposition of protein structures are essential instruments in structural biology. TopMatch-web provides an easy-to-use interface to a suite of techniques for protein structure alignments. Given a pair of protein structures, TopMatch calculates a list of alignments ordered by structural similarity. The corresponding superpositions can be explored in a 3D molecule viewer which highlights the structurally equivalent parts of the proteins.",
