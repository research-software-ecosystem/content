Protein similarity search in evolutionarily distant organisms by sequence comparison often turns out to be difficult. Here, we present the Structure and Sequence Alignment (SnS-Align) tool that graphically presents pairwise local alignment of sandwiched protein sequences, a hybrid of the primary protein sequence and its secondary structure. The utility of the tool is demonstrated by sample analysis of the gap junction protein superfamily of innexins/pannexins and the classic myoglobin family. SnS-Align can also be used for demarcation of the structurally conserved domains within superfamilies of paralogous genes.
