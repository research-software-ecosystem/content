The suite is designed to be flexible, allowing users a number of methods of achieving their aims. The programs are from a wide variety of sources but are connected by a common infrastructure provided by standard file formats, data objects and graphical interfaces. Structure solution by macromolecular crystallography is becoming increasingly automated and the CCP4 suite includes several automation pipelines. After giving a brief description of the evolution of CCP4 over the last 30 years, an overview of the current suite is given. While detailed descriptions are given in the accompanying articles, here it is shown how the individual programs contribute to a complete software package.","authors":["Winn M.D.","Ballard C.C.","Cowtan K.D.","Dodson E.J.","Emsley P.","Evans P.R.","Keegan R.M.","Krissinel E.B.","Leslie A.G.W.","McCoy A.","McNicholas S.J.","Murshudov G.N.","Pannu N.S.","Potterton E.A.","Powell H.R.","Read R.J.","Vagin A.","Wilson K.S."],"cit_count":6152,"doi":"10.1107/S0907444910045749","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography","title":"Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments","type":"Primary","year":"2011-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ccp4","biotoolsID":"ccp4","description":"Software suite for Macromolecular X-Ray Crystallography, including data processing, phasing and structure refinement.","homepage":"http://www.ccp4.ac.uk","name":"CCP4","version":["7.0"]}}
