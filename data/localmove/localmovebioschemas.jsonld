  "sc:description": "Monte-Carlo approach to the problem of finding best-fitting lattice models for biopolymers. Through a sequence of local moves, e.g. local backbone modifications, it walks through the conformational space, looking for a configuration as close as possible to the input 3D model, while keeping his points on-lattice. After a user-defined condition is triggered, the experiment stops and the currently best model can be retrieved as a PDB file.",
