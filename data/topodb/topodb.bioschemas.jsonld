      "sc:description": "a novel multifunctional management system for laboratory animal colonies.\n\nTopoDB requires Ruby version >= 2.5.2, Ruby on Rails version >= 5.2.0, and bundler version 2.0 . We recommend using rbenv to install and manage Ruby gems.\n\nLog in as the admin user that was created as part of the sample data set: email: admin@topodb.topo, password: admin123 . Once logged in as the administrator it is strongly recommended that you create new users to handle day-to-day activities in the application and that you change the Administrator account password (failure to do so can put your data at risk). Both of these activities can be done either directly in the users database table, or through the included rails admin feature, available in the main navigation bar.",
