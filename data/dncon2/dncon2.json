    "description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'domain-based', 'CNN)-based', 'multi-distance', 'CASP13' | Analysis of several key factors influencing deep learning-based inter-residue contact prediction | Deep convolutional neural networks for protein contact map prediction | Web-server and datasets at http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/dncon2/ | We tested in Ubuntu becasue the tool 'FreeContact' is easier to install in a Debian system. If you would like to install DNCON2 in some other operating systems, first test if 'FreeContact' can be installed in it. If, for some reason, you do not have a Ubuntu machine, and cannot install FreeContact, you can still use DNCON2. With just a few code updates you can skip using the FreeContact tool. You will get slightly less precise results",
