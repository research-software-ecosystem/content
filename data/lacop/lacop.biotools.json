                "abstract": "© 2022 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.Here, we describe a free, web-based simulation of the lac operon, “LacOp,” that is designed to enhance the learning of prokaryotic gene regulation and pathways in advanced high school and undergraduate genetics courses. This new electronic resource was created by a team of students in an advanced undergraduate course and is hosted online (http://flask-env.rnwhymamqf.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/lacop). LacOp has a simple web interface compatible with a range of devices, including smartphones. To determine whether the LacOp simulation enhances student learning from traditional instruction, we introduced the lac operon to undergraduate genetics students through a traditional classroom experience followed by use of the LacOp simulation. Students worked on their own using the included tutorial to create and test the effect of various genotypes on E. coli lactose metabolism and regulation. Upon completion of the tutorial, students showed measurable gains in conceptual understanding of the lac operon. These students also reported a generally favorable opinion of the LacOP simulation as a use of their instructional time.",
