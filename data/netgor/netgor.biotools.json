All rights reserved.We present an R-Shiny package, netGO, for novel network-integrated pathway enrichment analysis. The conventional Fisher's exact test (FET) considers the extent of overlap between target genes and pathway gene-sets, while recent network-based analysis tools consider only network interactions between the two. netGO implements an intuitive framework to integrate both the overlap and networks into a single score, and adaptively resamples genes based on network degrees to assess the pathway enrichment. In benchmark tests for gene expression and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, netGO captured the relevant gene-sets better than existing tools, especially when analyzing a small number of genes. Specifically, netGO provides user-interactive visualization of the target genes, enriched gene-set and their network interactions for both netGO and FET results for further analysis. For this visualization, we also developed a standalone R-Shiny package shinyCyJS to connect R-shiny and the JavaScript version of cytoscape.",
