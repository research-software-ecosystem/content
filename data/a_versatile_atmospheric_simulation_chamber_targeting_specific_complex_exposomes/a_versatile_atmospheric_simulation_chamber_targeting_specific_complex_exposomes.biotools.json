    "description": "REMEDIA developed a novel experimental approach for the generation of realistic polluted atmospheres, by coupling, for the first time, two advanced chambers, the CESAM (Chamber for Experimental Multiphase Atmospheric Simulation) chamber and the FORTH (Foundation for Research & Technology – Hellas) mobile simulation chamber to continuously generate air pollution levels that represent a variety of urban atmospheric conditions. The chambers can also be used on their own, but their combination facilitates the production of stable and representative aerosols, allowing for long-term exposure studies on preclinical models under controlled conditions focusing on specific sources (e.g., biomass burning).",
