      "sc:description": "Automated methylation analysis of amplicons from bisulfite flowgram sequencing.\n\nThe Roche 454 GS Junior sequencing platform allows locus-specific DNA methylation analysis using deep bisulfite amplicon sequencing. However, bisulfite-converted DNA reads may contain long T homopolymers, and the main sources of errors on pyrosequencing platforms are homopolymer over- and undercalls. Furthermore, existing tools do not always meet the analysis requirements for complex assay designs with multiple regions of interest (ROIs) from multiple samples. We have developed the amplikyzer software package to address the above challenges. It directly aligns the intensity sequences from standard flowgram files (SFF format) to given amplicon reference sequences, without converting to nucleotide FASTA format first, avoiding information loss by rounding flow intensities, and taking special measures to correctly process long homopolymers",
