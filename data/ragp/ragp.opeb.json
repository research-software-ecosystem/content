It incorporates a novel concept with an additional analysis layer where the probability of proline hydroxylation is estimated by a machine learning model. Only proteins predicted to contain hydroxyprolines are further analysed for HRGP characteristic motifs and features. ragp can also be used for protein annotation by obtaining predictions for several protein features based on sequence (secretory signals, transmembrane regions, domains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment sites and disordered regions). Additionally ragp provides tools for visualization of the mentioned attributes","homepage":"https://github.com/missuse/ragp","name":"Ragp"}}
