Web application calculates and displays descriptive statistics and graphs of amino acid pair distances with selected properties, such as geometric distance threshold, corresponding SCOP class of proteins and secondary structure types. In addition to the analysis of pre-calculated distances stored in the database, the amino acid distances of a single protein with the specified PDB identifier can also be analyzed.
