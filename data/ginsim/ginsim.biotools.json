The requirement of computer simulation for the understanding of cellular processes is now widely accepted, and a variety of modelling frameworks have been designed to meet this need. Here, we present a novel public release of the Gene Interaction Network simulation suite (GINsim), a software designed for the qualitative modelling and analysis of regulatory networks. The main functionalities of GINsim are illustrated through the analysis of a logical model for the core network controlling the fission yeast cell cycle. The last public release of GINsim (version 2.3), as well as development versions, can be downloaded from the dedicated website (http://gin.univ-mrs.fr/GINsim/), which further includes a model library, along with detailed tutorial and user manual. \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Formally, our approach leans on discrete mathematical and graph-theoretical concepts. GINsim encompasses an intuitive graph editor, enabling the definition and the parameterisation of a regulatory graph, as well as a simulation engine to compute the corresponding qualitative dynamical behaviour. Our computational approach is illustrated by a preliminary model analysis of the inter-cellular regulatory network activating Notch at the dorsal-ventral boundary in the wing imaginal disc of Drosophila. We focus on the cross-regulations between five genes (within and between two cells), which implements the dorsal-ventral border in the developing imaginal disc. Our simulations qualitatively reproduce the wild-type developmental pathway, as well as the outcome of various types of experimental perturbations, such as loss-of-function mutations or ectopically induced gene expression. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
