A number of rather accurate predictions were reported for various binary drug-target benchmark datasets. However, a notable drawback of a binary representation of interaction data is that missing endpoints for non-interacting drug-target pairs are not differentiated from inactive cases, and that predicted levels of activity depend on pre-defined binarization thresholds. In this paper, we present a method called SimBoost that predicts continuous (non-binary) values of binding affinities of compounds and proteins and thus incorporates the whole interaction spectrum from true negative to true positive interactions. Additionally, we propose a version of the method called SimBoostQuant which computes a prediction interval in order to assess the confidence of the predicted affinity, thus defining the Applicability Domain metrics explicitly. We evaluate SimBoost and SimBoostQuant on two established drug-target interaction benchmark datasets and one new dataset that we propose to use as a benchmark for read-across cheminformatics applications. We demonstrate that our methods outperform the previously reported models across the studied datasets.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "He T."}, {"name": "Heidemeyer M."}, {"name": "Ban F."}, {"name": "Cherkasov A."}, {"name": "Ester M."}], "date": "2017-04-18T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Cheminformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Martin Ester", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ester@sfu.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:simboost", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://zenodo.org/record/164436#.W4aXJZP7TGI", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Read-across approach for predicting drug\u2013target binding affinities using gradient boosting machines.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "simboost", "additionDate": "2018-08-29T13:02:14Z", "name": "SimBoost", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://zenodo.org/record/164436#.W4aXJZP7TGI", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
