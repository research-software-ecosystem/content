Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Phylogenies are increasingly used in all fields of medical and biological research. Because of the next generation sequencing revolution, datasets used for conducting phylogenetic analyses grow at an unprecedented pace. We present ExaML version 3, a dedicated production-level code for inferring phylogenies on whole-transcriptome and whole-genome alignments using supercomputers. Results: We introduce several improvements and extensions to ExaML: Extensions of substitution models and supported data types, the integration of a novel load balance algorithm as well as a parallel I/O optimization that significantly improve parallel efficiency, and a production-level implementation for Intel MIC-based hardware platforms.","authors":["Kozlov A.M.","Aberer A.J.","Stamatakis A."],"cit_count":87,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btv184","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"ExaML version 3: A tool for phylogenomic analyses on supercomputers","type":"Primary","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ExaML","biotoolsID":"ExaML","description":"Tool for phylogenomic analyses on supercomputers.","homepage":"https://github.com/stamatak/ExaML","name":"ExaML","version":["3.0"]}}
