R TOOLS FOR EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA.\n\nAbstractBACKGROUNDThe Human Protein Atlas (HPA) is a comprehensive resource for exploration of human proteome which contains a vast amount of proteomics and transcriptomics data generated from antibody-based tissue micro-array profiling and RNA deep-sequencing. Data from the HPA are freely available via proteinatlas.org, allowing scientists to access and incorporate the data into their research. Previously, the R package hpar has been created for fast and easy programmatic access of HPA data. Here, we introduce HPAanalyze, an R package aims to simplify exploratory data analysis from those data, as well as provide other complementary functionality to hpar.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
