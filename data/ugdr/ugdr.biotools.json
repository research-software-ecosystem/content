                "abstract": "Motivation: In eukaryotes, homologous recombination between the parental genomes frequently occurs during the evolutionary conserved process of meiosis, generating the genetic diversity transmitted by the gametes. The genome-wide determination of the frequency and location of the recombination events can now be efficiently performed by genotyping the offspring’s polymorphic markers. However, genotyping recombination in complex hybrid genomes with existing methods remains challenging because of their strain and ploidy specificity and the degree of diversity and complexity of the parental genomes, especially in > 2 n polyploids. Results: We present UGDR, a pipeline to genotype the polymorphisms of complex hybrid yeast genomes. It is based on optimal mapping strategies of NGS reads, comparative analyses of the allelic ratio variation and read depth coverage. We tested the UGDR pipeline with sequencing reads from recombined hybrid diploid yeast strains and various clinical strains exhibiting different degrees of ploidy. UGDR allows to plot the markers distribution and recombination profile per chromosome. Conclusion: UGDR detects and plots recombination events in haploids and polyploid yeasts, which facilitates the discovery and understanding of the yeast genetic recombination map and identify new out-performing recombinants.",
