Compared to existing software BioNano IrysView and the KSU scripts, the major advantages of runBNG are that the whole pipeline runs on one single platform and it has a high customizability.","authors":["Yuan Y.","Bayer P.E.","Lee H.-T.","Edwards D."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx366","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"RunBNG: A software package for BioNano genomic analysis on the command line","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:runbng","biotoolsID":"runbng","description":"Quality control of single molecule maps, optical map de novo assembly, comparisons between different optical maps, super-scaffolding and structural variation detection.","homepage":"https://github.com/appliedbioinformatics/runBNG","name":"runBNG"}}
