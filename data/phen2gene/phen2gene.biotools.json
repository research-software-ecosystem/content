    "description": "Rapid Phenotype-Driven Gene Prioritization for Rare Diseases.\n\nPhenotype driven gene prioritization for HPO.\n\nPhenotype-driven Gene Prioritization.\n\nPhen2Gene is a phenotype-driven gene prioritization tool, that takes HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) IDs as inputs, searches and prioritizes candidate causal disease genes. It is distributed under the MIT License by Wang Genomics Lab. Additionally we have provided a web server and an associated RESTful API service for running Phen2Gene. Finally, a mobile app for Phen2Gene and several other genetic diagnostic tools from our lab is being tested and will be available soon.\n\nPhen2Gene relies on your feedback. Please send an email if you wish to make a request, a comment, or report a bug.\n\nPlease click the link below to download the HPO2Gene KnowledgeBase (the size is around 2GB).\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/w4cseq (WGLAB.ORG), bio.tools/phenolyzer (WGLAB.ORG)",
