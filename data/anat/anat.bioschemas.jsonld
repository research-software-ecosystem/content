It is a framework for elucidating functional protein subnetworks using graph-theoretic and machine learning approaches.\n\nGenome-scale screening studies are gradually accumulating a wealth of data on the putative involvement of hundreds of genes in various cellular responses or functions. A fundamental challenge is to chart out the molecular pathways that underlie these systems. ANAT (Advanced Network Analysis Tool) , is an all-in-one resource that provides access to up-to-date large-scale physical association data in several organisms, advanced algorithms for network reconstruction, and a number of tools for exploring and evaluating the obtained network models. It is a plug-in for Cytoscape.",
