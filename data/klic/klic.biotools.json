Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Diverse applications-particularly in tumour subtyping-have demonstrated the importance of integrative clustering techniques for combining information from multiple data sources. Cluster Of Clusters Analysis (COCA) is one such approach that has been widely applied in the context of tumour subtyping. However, the properties of COCA have never been systematically explored, and its robustness to the inclusion of noisy datasets is unclear. Results: We rigorously benchmark COCA, and present Kernel Learning Integrative Clustering (KLIC) as an alternative strategy. KLIC frames the challenge of combining clustering structures as a multiple kernel learning problem, in which different datasets each provide a weighted contribution to the final clustering. This allows the contribution of noisy datasets to be down-weighted relative to more informative datasets. We compare the performances of KLIC and COCA in a variety of situations through simulation studies. We also present the output of KLIC and COCA in real data applications to cancer subtyping and transcriptional module discovery.",
