Multiple hypothesis testing may leave out explanatory features, each of which may be composed of individually insignificant variables. Multivariate hypothesis testing holds a non-mainstream position, considering the large computation overhead of large-scale matrix operation. Random forest provides a classification strategy for calculation of variable importance. However, it may be unsuitable for different distributions of samples. Results: Based on the thought of using an ensemble classifier, we develop a feature selection tool for differential expression analysis on expression profiles (i.e., ECFS-DEA for short). Considering the differences in sample distribution, a graphical user interface is designed to allow the selection of different base classifiers. Inspired by random forest, a common measure which is applicable to any base classifier is proposed for calculation of variable importance. After an interactive selection of a feature on sorted individual variables, a projection heatmap is presented using k-means clustering. ROC curve is also provided, both of which can intuitively demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected feature. Conclusions: Feature selection through ensemble classifiers helps to select important variables and thus is applicable for different sample distributions. Experiments on simulation and realistic data demonstrate the effectiveness of ECFS-DEA for differential expression analysis on expression profiles.
