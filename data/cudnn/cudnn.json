    "description": "Augmentation of Doppler Radar Data Using Generative Adversarial Network for Human Motion Analysis.\n\nObjectives:Human motion analysis can be applied to the diagnosis of musculoskeletal diseases, rehabilitation therapies, fall detection, and estimation of energy expenditure. To analyze human motion with micro-Doppler signatures measured by radar, a deep learning algorithm is one of the most effective approaches. Because deep learning requires a large data set, the high cost involved in measuring large amounts of human data is an intrinsic problem. The objective of this study is to augment human motion micro-Doppler data employing generative adversarial networks (GANs) to improve the accuracy of human motion classification. Methods:To test data augmentation provided by GANs, authentic data for 7 human activities were collected using micro-Doppler radar.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CUDA', 'Anaconda' (bio.tools/anaconda_cnv), 'micro-Doppler', 'GANs'",
