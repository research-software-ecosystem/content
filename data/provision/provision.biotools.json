All rights reserved.Proteomics is a powerful tool for protein expression analysis and is becoming more readily available to researchers through core facilities or specialized collaborations. However, one major bottleneck for routine implementation and accessibility of this technology to the wider scientific community is the complexity of data analysis. To this end, we have created ProVision, a free open-source web-based analytics platform that allows users to analyze data from two common proteomics relative quantification workflows, namely label-free and tandem mass tagbased experiments. Furthermore, ProVision allows the freedom to interface with the data analysis pipeline while maintaining a user-friendly environment and providing default parameters for fast statistical and exploratory data analysis. Finally, multiple customizable quality control, differential expression plots as well as enrichments and protein- protein interaction prediction can be generated online in one platform. Availability and implementation: Quick start and step-by-step tutorials as well as tutorial data are fully incorporated in the web application. This application is available online at https://provision.shinyapps.io/provision/ for free use.
