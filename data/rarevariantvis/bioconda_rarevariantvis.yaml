description: Second version of RareVariantVis package aims to provide comprehensive
  information about rare variants for your genome data. It annotates, filters and
  presents genomic variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per chromosome way.
  For discovered rare variants CRISPR guide RNAs are designed, so the user can plan
  further functional studies. Large structural variants, including copy number variants
  are also supported. Package accepts variants directly from variant caller - for
  example GATK or Speedseq. Output of package are lists of variants together with
  adequate visualization. Visualization of variants is performed in two ways - standard
  that outputs png figures and interactive that uses JavaScript d3 package. Interactive
  visualization allows to analyze trio/family data, for example in search for causative
  variants in rare Mendelian diseases, in point-and-click interface. The package includes
  homozygous region caller and allows to analyse whole human genomes in less than
  30 minutes on a desktop computer. RareVariantVis disclosed novel causes of several
  rare monogenic disorders, including one with non-coding causative variant - keratolythic
  winter erythema.
