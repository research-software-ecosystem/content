summary: BioConductor collection of PCA methods
description: >
   Provides Bayesian PCA, Probabilistic PCA, Nipals PCA,
   Inverse Non-Linear PCA and the conventional SVD PCA. A cluster
   based method for missing value estimation is included for
   comparison. BPCA, PPCA and NipalsPCA may be used to perform PCA
   on incomplete data as well as for accurate missing value
   estimation. A set of methods for printing and plotting the
   results is also provided. All PCA methods make use of the same
   data structure (pcaRes) to provide a common interface to the
   PCA results. Initiated at the Max-Planck Institute for
   Molecular Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany.
