description: SwimR is an R-based suite that calculates, analyses, and plots the frequency
  of C. elegans swimming behavior over time. It places a particular emphasis on identifying
  paralysis and quantifying the kinetic elements of paralysis during swimming. Data
  is input to SwipR from a custom built program that fits a 5 point morphometric spine
  to videos of single worms swimming in a buffer called Worm Tracker.
