There are several weak and strong interactions that render stability to a protein structure or an assembly. Protein Interactions Calculator (PIC) is a server which, given the coordinate set of 3D structure of a protein or an assembly, computes various interactions such as disulphide bonds, interactions between hydrophobic residues, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonds, aromatic- aromatic interactions, aromatic-sulphur interactions and cation-\u03c0 interactions within a protein or between proteins in a complex. Interactions are calculated on the basis of standard, published criteria. The identified interactions between residues can be visualized using a RasMol and Jmol interface. The advantage with PIC server is the easy availability of inter-residue interaction calculations in a single site. It also determines the accessible surface area and residue-depth, which is the distance of a residue from the surface of the protein. User can also recognize specific kind of interactions, such as apolar-apolar residue interactions or ionic interactions, that are formed between buried or exposed residues or near the surface or deep inside. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 466, "authors": [{"name": "Tina K.G."}, {"name": "Bhadra R."}, {"name": "Srinivasan N."}], "date": "2007-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pic", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://crick.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/~PIC/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}, {"term": "Residue interaction calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0248"}, {"term": "Hydrogen bond calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0394"}, {"term": "Protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"}, {"term": "Protein interaction analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2949"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:39Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Server which recognizes various kinds of interactions, such as disulphide bonds, hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, aromatic interactions, and ionic interactions within a protein or between proteins in a complex.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "pic", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T14:14:16Z", "name": "PIC", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
