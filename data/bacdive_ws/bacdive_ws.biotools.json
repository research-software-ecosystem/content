Hot spots of (meta)data are internal descriptions of culture collections and initial descriptions of novel taxa in primary literature. Here we describe three exemplary mobilization projects which yielded metadata published through the prokaryotic metadatabase BacDive. The Reichenbach collection of myxobacteria includes information on 12,535 typewritten index cards which were digitized. A total of 37,156 data points were extracted by text mining. In the second mobilization project, Analytical Profile Index (API) tests on paper forms were targeted. Overall 6820 API tests were digitized, which provide physiological data of 4524 microbial strains. Thirdly, the extraction of metadata from 523 new species descriptions of the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, yielding 35,651 data points, is described. All data sets were integrated and published in BacDive. Thereby these metadata not only became accessible and searchable but were also linked to strain taxonomy, isolation source, cultivation condition, and molecular biology data.",

By integrating high-quality data from additional culture collections as well as detailed information from species descriptions, the amount of data provided has increased by 30% over the past three years. A newly developed query builder tool in the advanced search now allows complex database queries. Thereby bacterial strains can be systematically searched based on combinations of their attributes, e.g. growth and metabolic features for biotechnological applications or to identify gaps in the present knowledge about bacteria. A new interactive dashboard provides a statistic overview over the most important data fields. Additional new features are improved genomic sequence data, integrated NCBI TaxIDs and links to BacMedia, the new sister database on cultivation media. To improve the findability and interpretation of data through search engines, data in BacDive are annotated with bioschemas.org terms.",

It has been selected as an ELIXIR Core Data Resource as well as a Global Core Biodata Resource. Since its initial release more than ten years ago, BacDive (https://bacdive.dsmz.de) has grown tremendously in content and functionalities, and is a comprehensive resource covering the phenotypic diversity of prokaryotes with data on taxonomy, morphology, physiology, cultivation, and more. The current release (2023.2) contains 2.6 million data points on 97 334 strains, reflecting an increase by 52% since the previous publication in 2021. This remarkable growth can largely be attributed to the integration of the world-wide largest collection of Analytical Profile Index (API) test results, which are now fully integrated into the database and searchable. A novel BacDive knowledge graph provides powerful search options through a SPARQL endpoint, including the possibility for federated searches across multiple data sources. The high-quality data provided by BacDive is increasingly being used for the training of artificial intelligence models and resulting genome-based predictions with high confidence are now used to fill content gaps in the database.",

                "abstract": "The bacterial metadatabase BacDive (http://bacdive.dsmz.de) has become a comprehensive resource for structured data on the taxonomy, morphology, physiology, cultivation, isolation and molecular data of prokaryotes. With its current release (7/2018) the database offers information for 63 669 bacterial and archaeal strains including 12 715 type strains. During recent developments of BacDive, the enrichment of information on existing strains was prioritized. This has resulted in a 146% increase of database content over the past three years. Especially rich datasets were integrated from 4782 manual annotated species descriptions in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology which yielded standardized phenotypic data for 5468 type strains. Another important improvement of content was achieved through the mobilization of 8977 Analytical Profile Index (API ® ) test results that constitute physiological data for the identification of 5237 strains. BacDive offers a unique API ® data collection with respect to size and diversity. In addition, data on fatty acid profiles and antibiotic susceptibility tests were integrated. A revised graphical user interface and new search tools such as the API ® test finder, the TAXplorer, or the Microbial Isolation Source Search significantly improve the user experience.",
