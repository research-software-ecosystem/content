    "description": "Development of Reporting Guidelines for Animal Health Surveillance-AHSURED.\n\nThe objective of the present project is to produce a set of reporting guidelines to facilitate consistent and credible reporting of surveillance activities and their outcomes.\n\nThe rationale behind it is that by moving towards more output\u2212based standards for surveillance, and allowing greater flexibility in surveillance design, there will be an increased need for transparency about design features as well as how the activities are actually implemented.\n\nThe choice of a Wiki format was motivated by the fact that refinements and improvements of the guidelines are both expected and welcome, so feel free to contribute by sending your comments to ahsured@sva.se.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Surveillance-AHSURED', 'Animal Health Surveillance-AHSURED'",
