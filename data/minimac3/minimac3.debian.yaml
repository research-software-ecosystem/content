summary: Fast Imputation Based on State Space Reduction HMM
description: >
   Minimac4 is a lower memory and more computationally efficient implementation
   of "minimac2/3". It is an algorithm for genotypic imputation that works on
   phased genotypes (say from MaCH).
   .
   Minimac4 is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more
   computationally efficient way with no loss of accuracy. This algorithm
   analyzes only the unique sets of haplotypes in small genomic segments, thereby
   saving on time\-complexity, computational memory but no loss in degree of
   accuracy.
