      "sc:description": "It is designed to handle very large reference panels in a more computationally efficient way with no loss of accuracy. It accomplishes this by identifying repeat haplotype patterns and using these to simplify the underlying calculations, with no loss of accuracy. It uses M3VCF files to store reference panel information in a compact form. M3VCF files can also store pre-calculated estimates of recombination fraction and error, which speeds up later rounds of imputation.",
