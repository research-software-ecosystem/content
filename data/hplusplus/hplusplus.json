A number of existing practical methods predict protonation equilibrium pK constants of macromolecules based upon their atomic resolution Protein Data Bank (PDB) structures; the calculations are often performed within the framework of the continuum electrostatics model. Unfortunately, these methodologies are complex, involve multiple steps and require considerable investment of effort. Our web server http:// biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++ provides access to a tool that automates this process, allowing both experts and novices to quickly obtain estimates of pKs as well as other related characteristics of biomolecules such as isoelectric points, titration curves and energies of protonation microstates. Protons are added to the input structure according to the calculated ionization states of its titratable groups at the user-specified pH; the output is in the PQR (PDB + charges + radii) format. In addition, corresponding coordinate and topology files are generated in the format supported by the molecular modeling package AMBER. The server is intended for a broad community of biochemists, molecular modelers, structural biologists and drug designers; it can also be used as an educational tool in biochemistry courses. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 614, "authors": [{"name": "Gordon J.C."}, {"name": "Myers J.B."}, {"name": "Folta T."}, {"name": "Shoja V."}, {"name": "Heath L.S."}, {"name": "Onufriev A."}], "date": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "22570416", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "H++ 3.0: Automating pK prediction and the preparation of biomolecular structures for atomistic molecular modeling and simulations", "abstract": "The accuracy of atomistic biomolecular modeling and simulation studies depend on the accuracy of the input structures. Preparing these structures for an atomistic modeling task, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, can involve the use of a variety of different tools for: correcting errors, adding missing atoms, filling valences with hydrogens, predicting pK values for titratable amino acids, assigning predefined partial charges and radii to all atoms, and generating force field parameter/topology files for MD. Identifying, installing and effectively using the appropriate tools for each of these tasks can be difficult for novice and time-consuming for experienced users. H++ (http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/) is a free open-source web server that automates the above key steps in the preparation of biomolecular structures for molecular modeling and simulations. H++ also performs extensive error and consistency checking, providing error/warning messages together with the suggested corrections. In addition to numerous minor improvements, the latest version of H++ includes several new capabilities and options: fix erroneous (flipped) side chain conformations for HIS, GLN and ASN, include a ligand in the input structure, process nucleic acid structures and generate a solvent box with specified number of common ions for explicit solvent MD. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 394, "authors": [{"name": "Anandakrishnan R."}, {"name": "Aguilar B."}, {"name": "Onufriev A.V."}], "date": "2012-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ramu Anandakrishnan", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ramu@vt.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hplusplus", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://biophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0477"}, {"term": "Molecular dynamics simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}, {"term": "Nucleic acid structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0475"}, {"term": "Protein modelling (side chains)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0480"}, {"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Automated tool for computing pK values of ionizable groups in macromolecules and adding missing hydrogen atoms according to the specified pH of the environment.
