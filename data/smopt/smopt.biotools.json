This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.We present a systematic procedure to improve the qualities of triangular molecular surface meshes and at the same time preserve the manifoldness. The procedure utilizes an algorithm to remove redundant points having three or four valences and another algorithm to smooth the mesh using a modified version of Laplacian method without causing intersecting triangles. This approach can be effectively applied to any manifold surface meshes with arbitrary complex geometry. In this paper, the tested meshes are biomolecular surface meshes exhibiting typically highly irregular geometry. The results show that the qualities of the surface meshes are greatly improved and the manifoldness of the surface meshes are preserved. Compared with the original meshes, these improved molecular surface meshes can be directly applied to boundary element simulations and generation of body-fitted volume meshes using Tetgen. The procedure has been incorporated into our triangular molecular surface mesh generator, TMSmesh 2.0. It can be also used as a standalone program and works together with any other surface triangular mesh generator to obtain qualified manifold mesh.
