Principal component analysis has been used to provide a simple graphical comparison of the differences/similarities between columns in the entire database and differing subsets such as \"Aqua type\"/enhanced polar selectivity phases. The PCA has been correlated to the phase's ability to analyse a range of hydrophilic bases. \u00a9 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",
