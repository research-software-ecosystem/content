description: Developed by the TIGR institute this software detects coding sequences
  in bacteria and archea. . Glimmer is a system for finding genes in microbial DNA,
  especially the genomes of bacteria and archaea. Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated
  Markov Modeler) uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the coding regions
  and distinguish them from noncoding DNA.
