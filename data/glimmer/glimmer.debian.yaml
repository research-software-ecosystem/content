summary: Gene detection in archea and bacteria
description: >
   Developed by the TIGR institute this software detects coding sequences in
   bacteria and archea.
   .
   Glimmer is a system for finding genes in microbial DNA, especially the
   genomes of bacteria and archaea. Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated
   Markov Modeler) uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the
   coding regions and distinguish them from noncoding DNA.
