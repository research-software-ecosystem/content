description: "Developed by the TIGR institute this software detects coding sequences\
  \ in bacteria and archea. . Glimmer is a system for finding genes in microbial DNA,\
  \ especially the genomes of bacteria and archaea. Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated\
  \ Markov Modeler) uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the coding\
  \ regions and distinguish them from noncoding DNA.\n"
