Common to most biological applications is a mapping of the reads to an almost identical or highly similar reference genome. Due to the large amounts of data, efficient algorithms and implementations are crucial for this task. We present an efficient read mapping tool called RazerS. It allows the user to align sequencing reads of arbitrary length using either the Hamming distance or the edit distance. Our tool can work either lossless or with a user-defined loss rate at higher speeds. Given the loss rate, we present an approach that guarantees not to lose more reads than specified. This enables the user to adapt to the problem at hand and provides a seamless tradeoff between sensitivity and running time. \u00a9 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 98, "authors": [{"name": "Weese D."}, {"name": "Emde A.-K."}, {"name": "Rausch T."}, {"name": "Doring A."}, {"name": "Reinert K."}], "date": "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "David Weese", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "weese@inf.fu-berlin.de"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Anne-Katrin Emde", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "emde@inf.fu-berlin.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:razers", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/seqan/seqan/tree/master/apps/razers", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Local alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0495"}, {"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "RazerS allows the user to align sequencing reads of arbitrary length using either the Hamming distance or the edit distance.
