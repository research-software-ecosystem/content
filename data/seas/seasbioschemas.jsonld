  "sc:description": "A computational tool for pathway enrichment analysis over a given set of genes in a specified organism against pathways (or subsystems) in the SEED database, a popular pathway database for bacteria. SEAS maps a given set of genes in a bacterium to genes currently covered by SEED through gene ID and/or orthology mapping, and then calculates the statistical significance of the enrichment of each relevant SEED pathway by the mapped genes.",
