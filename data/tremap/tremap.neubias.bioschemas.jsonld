  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>\"we present a new fully automated 3D reconstruction algorithm, called TReMAP, short for Tracing, Reverse Mapping and Assembling of 2D Projections. Instead of tracing a 3D image directly in the 3D space as seen in majority of the tracing methods, we first trace the 2D projection trees in 2Dplanes, followed by reverse-mapping the resulting 2D tracing results back into the 3D space as 3D curves; then we use a minimal spanning tree (MST) method to assemble all the 3D curves to generate the final 3D reconstruction. Because we simplify a 3D reconstruction problem into 2D, the computational costs are reduced dramatically.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suitable for high throughput neuron image analysis (image sizes &gt;10GB). This plugin can be used with default parameters or user-defined parameters.</p>\r\n",
