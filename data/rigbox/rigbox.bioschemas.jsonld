      "sc:description": "An Open-Source Toolbox for Probing Neurons and Behavior.\n\nRigbox is a high-performance, open-source MATLAB toolbox for managing behavioral neuroscience experiments. Rigbox's main goals are to simplify hardware/software interfacing, behavioral task design, and visual and auditory stimuli presentation. Additionally, Rigbox can time-align datastreams from multiple sources and communicate with a remote database to manage experiment data. Rigbox is mostly object-oriented and highly modular, which simplifies the process of designing experiments. For detailed information, see the publication.",
