                "abstract": "We have developed PrediSi (Prediction of Signal peptides), a new tool for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage positions in bacterial and eukaryotic amino acid sequences. In contrast to previous prediction tools, our new software is especially useful for the analysis of large datasets in real time with high accuracy. PrediSi allows the evaluation of whole proteome datasets, which are currently accumulating as a result of numerous genome projects and proteomics experiments. The method employed is based on a position weight matrix approach improved by a frequency correction which takes in to consideration the amino acid bias present in proteins. The software was trained using sequences extracted from the most recent version of the SwissProt database. PrediSi is accessible via a web interface. An extra Java package was designed for the integration of PrediSi into other software projects. The tool is freely available on the World Wide Web at http://www.predisi.de. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
