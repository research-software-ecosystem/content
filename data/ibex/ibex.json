    "description": "Modular Open-Source Software for Digital Radiography.\n\nA device-independent software package, named iBEX, is developed to accelerate the research and development efforts for X-ray imaging setups such as chest radiography, linear and multidirectional tomography, and dental and skeletal radiography. Its extension mechanism makes the software adaptable for a wide range of digital X-ray imaging hardware combinations and provides capabilities for researchers to develop image processing plug-ins. Independent of the X-ray sensor technology, iBEX could integrate with heterogeneous communication channels of digital detectors. iBEX is a freeware option for preclinical and early clinical testing of radiography devices.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
