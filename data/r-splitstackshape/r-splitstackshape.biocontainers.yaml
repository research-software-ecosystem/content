description: Online data collection tools like Google Forms often export multiple-response
  questions with data concatenated in cells. The concat.split (cSplit) family of functions
  splits such data into separate cells. The package also includes functions to stack
  groups of columns and to reshape wide data, even when the data are "unbalanced"---something
  which reshape (from base R) does not handle, and which melt and dcast from reshape2
  do not easily handle.
