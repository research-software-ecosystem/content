PASA is applicable for researchers at all levels that are interested in addressing basic questions related to B cell development and differentiation, as well as an application focused tool for vaccine development, immunodiagnostic discovery and monoclonal antibody engineering. The web server accepts proteomics spectral files (in '.raw' format), and requires (at least) two technical replicates of each fraction (elution and flow-through). See running example input and output.\n\nPASA web server allows generating quantitative molecular measurements related to serum antibody repertoire from high-resolution proteomic data.\n\nProteomics Analysis of Serum Antibodies web server.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
