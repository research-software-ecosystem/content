Here we describe an automated pipeline for genome annotation that integrates RNA-seq and gene-boundary data sets, which we call Generalized RNA Integration Tool, or GRIT. Applying GRIT to Drosophila melanogaster short-read RNA-seq, cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) and poly(A)-site-seq data collected for the modENCODE project, we recovered the vast majority of previously annotated transcripts and doubled the total number of transcripts cataloged. We found that 20% of protein coding genes encode multiple protein-localization signals and that, in 20-d-old adult fly heads, genes with multiple polyadenylation sites are more common than genes with alternative splicing or alternative promoters. GRIT demonstrates 30% higher precision and recall than the most widely used transcript assembly tools. GRIT will facilitate the automated generation of high-quality genome annotations without the need for extensive manual annotation. © 2014 Nature America, Inc.
