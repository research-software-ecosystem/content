description: "FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small\
  \ polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), indels (insertions\
  \ and deletions), MNPs (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex events (composite\
  \ insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a short-read sequencing\
  \ alignment.\n"
