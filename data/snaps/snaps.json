    "description": "Sensor Analytics Point Solutions for Detection and Decision Support Systems.\n\nIn this review, we discuss the role of sensor analytics point solutions (SNAPS), a reduced complexity machine-assisted decision support tool. We summarize the approaches used for mobile phone-based chemical biological sensors, including general hardware and software requirements for signal transduction and acquisition. We introduce SNAPS, part of a platform approach to converge sensor data and analytics. The platform is designed to consist of a portfolio of modular tools which may lend itself to dynamic composability by enabling context-specific selection of relevant units, resulting in case-based working modules. SNAPS is an element of this platform where data analytics, statistical characterization and algorithms may be delivered to the data either via embedded systems in devices, or sourced, in near real-time, from mist, fog or cloud computing resources.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
