                "abstract": "\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).Background: Leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) play central roles in sensing various signals to regulate plant development and environmental responses. The extracellular domains (ECDs) of plant LRR-RLKs contain LRR motifs, consisting of highly conserved residues and variable residues, and are responsible for ligand perception as a receptor or co-receptor. However, there are few comprehensive studies on the ECDs of LRR-RLKs due to the difficulty in effectively identifying the divergent LRR repeats. Results: In the current study, an efficient LRR motif prediction program, the \u201cPhyto-LRR prediction\u201d program, was developed based on the position-specific scoring matrix algorithm (PSSM) with some optimizations. This program was trained by 16-residue plant-specific LRR-highly conserved segments (HCS) from LRR-RLKs of 17 represented land plant species and a database containing more than 55,000 predicted LRRs based on this program was constructed. Both the prediction tool and database are freely available at http://phytolrr.com/ for website usage and at http://github.com/phytolrr for local usage. The LRR-RLKs were classified into 18 subgroups (SGs) according to the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis of kinase domains (KDs) of the sequences. Based on the database and the SGs, the characteristics of the LRR motifs in the ECDs of the LRR-RLKs were examined, such as the arrangement of the LRRs, the solvent accessibility, the variable residues, and the N-glycosylation sites, revealing a comprehensive profile of the plant LRR-RLK ectodomains. Conclusion: The \u201cPhyto-LRR prediction\u201d program is effective in predicting the LRR segments in plant LRR-RLKs, which, together with the database, will facilitate the exploration of plant LRR-RLKs functions. Based on the database, comprehensive sequential characteristics of the plant LRR-RLK ectodomains were profiled and analyzed.",
