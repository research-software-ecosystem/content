KID includes 6,225 low-throughput and 21,990 high-throughput interactions, from greater than 35,000 experiments. By quantitatively integrating these data, we identified 517 high-confidence kinase-substrate pairs that we consider a gold standard. We show that this gold standard can be used to assess published high-throughput datasets, suggesting that it will enable similar rigorous assessments in the future. © 2011 Sharifpoor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Sharifpoor S.","Nguyen Ba A.N.","Young J.-Y.","van Dyk D.","Friesen H.","Douglas A.C.","Kurat C.F.","Chong Y.T.","Founk K.","Moses A.M.","Andrews B.J."],"cit_count":33,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"21492431","title":"A quantitative literature-curated gold standard for kinase-substrate pairs","year":"2011-04-14"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:yeast_kid","biotoolsID":"yeast_kid","description":"Contains high- and low-throughput data relevant to phosphorylation events.
