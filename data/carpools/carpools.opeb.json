Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Genetic screens by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering have become a powerful tool for functional genomics. However, there is currently a lack of end-to-end software pipelines to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screens based on next generation sequencing. Results: The CRISPR-AnalyzeR for pooled screens (caRpools) is an R package for exploratory data analysis that provides a complete workflow to analyze CRISPR/Cas9 screens. To further support the analysis of large-scale screens, caRpools integrates screening documentation and generation of standardized analysis reports. Availability and implementation: caRpools, manuals and an open virtual appliance are available at http://github.com/boutroslab/caRpools.","authors":["Winter J.","Breinig M.","Heigwer F.","Brugemann D.","Leible S.","Pelz O.","Zhan T.","Boutros M."],"cit_count":14,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26508755","title":"CaRpools: An R package for exploratory data analysis and documentation of pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens","year":"2015-09-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:carpools","biotoolsID":"carpools","description":"CaRpools is an R package for exploratory data analysis of pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screens.","homepage":"https://github.com/boutroslab/caRpools","name":"CaRpools"}}
