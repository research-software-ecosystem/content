Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. In recent years, major initiatives such as the International Human Epigenome Consortium have generated thousands of high-quality genome-wide datasets for a large variety of assays and cell types. This data can be used as a reference to assess whether the signal from a user-provided dataset corresponds to its expected experiment, as well as to help reveal unexpected biological associations. We have developed the epiGenomic Efficient Correlator (epiGeEC) tool to enable genomewide comparisons of very large numbers of datasets. A public Galaxy implementation of epiGeEC allows comparison of user datasets with thousands of public datasets in a few minutes.","authors":["Laperle J.","Helbert-Deschamps S.","Raby J.","De Lima Morais D.A.","Barrette M.","Bujold D.","Bastin C.","Robert M.-A.","Nadeau J.-F.","Harel M.","Nordell-Markovits A.","Veilleux A.","Bourque G.","Jacques P.-E."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty655","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"The epiGenomic Efficient Correlator (epiGeEC) tool allows fast comparison of user datasets with thousands of public epigenomic datasets","type":"Primary","year":"2019-02-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:epiGeEC","biotoolsID":"epiGeEC","description":"epiGenomic Efficient Correlator (epiGeEC) tool to enable genome-wide comparisons of very large numbers of public epigenomic datasets.","homepage":"https://epigeec.genap.ca/galaxy","name":"epiGeEC"}}
