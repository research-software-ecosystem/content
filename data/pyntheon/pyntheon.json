    "description": "A Functional Analysis Framework for Protein Modifications and Mutations of 83 Model Organisms | Pyntheon; A post translational modifications (PTMs) mapping tool for 87 different species, these PTMs are taken from a large array of popular lab specimens | we are presenting, Universal Functional PTMs Mapping Tool (Pyntheon) which maps post translational modifications (PTMs) present in the functional regions of proteins of almost all lab specimens that are popular among research community. From viruses to human, this tool includes 87 species (see species_id.txt) can help mapping the mutations to PTMs sites or give information about the PTMs present for a list of proteins (UniProt ID) of interest",
