Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Summary: Phenopolis is an open-source web server providing an intuitive interface to genetic and phenotypic databases. It integrates analysis tools such as variant filtering and gene prioritization based on phenotype. The Phenopolis platform will accelerate clinical diagnosis, gene discovery and encourage wider adoption of the Human Phenotype Ontology in the study of rare genetic diseases.","authors":["Pontikos N.","Yu J.","Moghul I.","Withington L.","Blanco-Kelly F.","Vulliamy T.","Wong T.L.E.","Murphy C.","Cipriani V.","Fiorentino A.","Arno G.","Greene D.","Jacobsen J.O.B.","Clark T.","Gregory D.S.","Nemeth A.M.","Halford S.","Inglehearn C.F.","Downes S.","Black G.C.","Webster A.R.","Hardcastle A.J.","Plagnol V.","Hall G.","Ingram S.","Gillespie R.","Manson F.","Sergouniotis P.","Toomes C.","Ali M.","McKibbin M.","Poulter J.","Khan K.","Lord E.","Lise S.","Michaelides M.","Cheetham M.E.","Van Heyningen V."],"cit_count":7,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx147","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"28334266","title":"Phenopolis: An open platform for harmonization and analysis of genetic and phenotypic data","type":"Primary","year":"2017-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Phenopolis","biotoolsID":"Phenopolis","description":"Open platform for harmonization and analysis of genetic and phenotypic data.","homepage":"https://phenopolis.org/","name":"Phenopolis"}}
