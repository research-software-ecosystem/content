This article reports a new web server, Super, dedicated to the task of rapidly screening the protein data bank (PDB) to identify all fragments that superpose with a query under a prespecified threshold of root-mean-square deviation (RMSD). Super relies on efficiently computing a mathematical bound on the commonly used structural similarity measure, RMSD of superposition. This allows the server to filter out a large proportion of fragments that are unrelated to the query; >99 of the total number of fragments in some cases. For a typical query, Super scans the current PDB containing over 80500 structures (with ∼40 million potential oligopeptide fragments to match) in under a minute.
