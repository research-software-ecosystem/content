                "abstract": "© 2020, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.Response-time extended multinomial processing tree models (RT-MPT; Klauer and Kellen, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 82, 111–130 2018) provide estimates of process-completion times for cognitive processes modeled by means of multinomial processing tree (MPT) models (Batchelder and Riefer, Psychonomic Bulletin & Review, 6, 57–86 1999). We present the R package rtmpt with which it is possible to fit RT-MPT models easily. The package is free and open source, it can be used with two established MPT syntaxes, and has a number of useful features, such as suppressing process-completion times for specific process outcomes, holding process probabilities constant, and changing some prior parameters. In the background of the R package, an altered version of the original C++ code is used for the MCMC sampling. We provide a guide to using rtmpt, validate the underlying hierarchical Bayesian algorithm of rtmpt using simulation-based calibration and show that previously reported results can be reproduced using rtmpt.",
