    "description": "Asparaginases are one of the most successful biopharmaceuticals that play a pivotal role in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In order to find new asparaginases with improved properties (stability, substrate affinity, immunogenicity) or to achieve these goals by enzyme engineering, it is essential to collect and accurately classify asparaginases from various sources. The database covers 124 manually curated sequences and more than 100,000 automatically curated enzymes.",
