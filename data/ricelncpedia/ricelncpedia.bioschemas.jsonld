      "sc:description": "a comprehensive database of rice long non-coding RNAs.\n\nLong non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play significant functions in various biological processes including differentiation, development and adaptation to different environments. Although multi research focused on lncRNAs in rice, the systematic identification and annotation of lncRNAs expressed in different tissues, developmental stages under diverse conditions are still scarce. This impacts the elucidation of their functional significance and the further research on them. Here, RiceLncPedia is constructed including rice lncRNAs explored from 2313 publically available rice RNA-seq libraries and characterize them with multi-omics data sets",
