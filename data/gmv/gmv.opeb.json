Here we provide the first documented evidence that imposing gene start consistency improves the accuracy of gene start-site prediction. We applied an algorithm using a genome majority vote (GMV) scheme to increase the consistency of gene starts among orthologs. We used a set of validated Escherichia coli genes as a standard to quantify accuracy. Results showed that the GMV algorithm can correct hundreds of gene prediction errors in sets of five or ten genomes while introducing few errors. Using a conservative calculation, we project that GMV would resolve many inconsistencies and errors in publicly available microbial gene maps. Our simple and logical solution provides a notable advance toward accurate gene maps.",

For a set of orthologous genes, if the positions of the PRODIGAL selected starts coincide in a multiple sequence alignment, they are accepted. If they do not coincide, a consistent start position is sought where a majority of the highest-scoring PRODIGAL selected sites coincide. If such a position is found, it is accepted, and the predictions are changed for the outlying genes.",
