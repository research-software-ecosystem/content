    "description": "The pipeline runs PRODIGAL gene predictions on all genomes, runs pan-reciprocal BLAST, and identifies ortholog sets. For a set of orthologous genes, if the positions of the PRODIGAL selected starts coincide in a multiple sequence alignment, they are accepted. If they do not coincide, a consistent start position is sought where a majority of the highest-scoring PRODIGAL selected sites coincide. If such a position is found, it is accepted, and the predictions are changed for the outlying genes.",

                "abstract": "Recent studies have noted extensive inconsistencies in gene start sites among orthologous genes in related microbial genomes. Here we provide the first documented evidence that imposing gene start consistency improves the accuracy of gene start-site prediction. We applied an algorithm using a genome majority vote (GMV) scheme to increase the consistency of gene starts among orthologs. We used a set of validated Escherichia coli genes as a standard to quantify accuracy. Results showed that the GMV algorithm can correct hundreds of gene prediction errors in sets of five or ten genomes while introducing few errors. Using a conservative calculation, we project that GMV would resolve many inconsistencies and errors in publicly available microbial gene maps. Our simple and logical solution provides a notable advance toward accurate gene maps.",
