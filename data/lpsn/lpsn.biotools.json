                "abstract": "Microbial systematics is heavily influenced by genome-based methods and challenged by an ever increasing number of taxon names and associated sequences in public data repositories. This poses a challenge for database systems, particularly since it is obviously advantageous if such data are based on a globally recognized approach to manage names, such as the International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes. The amount of data can only be handled if accurate and reliable high-throughput platforms are available that are able to both comply with this demand and to keep track of all changes in an efficient and flexible way. The List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) is an expert-curated authoritative resource for prokaryotic nomenclature and is available at https://lpsn.dsmz.de. The Type (Strain) Genome Server (TYGS) is a high-throughput platform for accurate genome-based taxonomy and is available at https://tygs.dsmz.de. We here present important updates of these two previously introduced, heavily interconnected platforms for taxonomic nomenclature and classification, including new high-level facilities providing access to bioinformatic algorithms, a considerable expansion of the database content, and new ways to easily access the data.",
