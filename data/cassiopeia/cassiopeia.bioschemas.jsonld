This suite comes equipped with three main modules:.\n\nPhylogeny Reconstruction: a collection of tools for constructing phylogenies. We support 5 algorithms currently: a greedy algorithm based on multi-state compatibility, an exact Steiner-Tree solver, Cassiopeia (the combination of these two), Neighbor-Joining, and Camin-Sokal Maximum Parsimony.\n\nTarget Site Sequencing Pipeline: a pipeline for extracing lineage information from raw fastqs produced from a lineage tracing experiment",
