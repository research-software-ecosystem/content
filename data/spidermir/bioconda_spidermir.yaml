description: 'The aims of SpidermiR are : i) facilitate the network open-access data
  retrieval from GeneMania data, ii) prepare the data using the appropriate gene nomenclature,
  iii) integration of miRNA data in a specific network, iv) provide different standard
  analyses and v) allow the user to visualize the results. In more detail, the package
  provides multiple methods for query, prepare and download network data (GeneMania),
  and the integration with validated and predicted miRNA data (mirWalk, miRTarBase,
  miRandola,Pharmaco-miR,DIANA, Miranda, PicTar and TargetScan) and the use of standard
  analysis (igraph) and visualization methods (networkD3).'
