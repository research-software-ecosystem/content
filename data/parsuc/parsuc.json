    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Parallel Subsampling-Based Method for Clustering Remote Sensing Big Data | Remote sensing big data (RSBD) is generally characterized by huge volumes, diversity, and high dimensionality. Mining hidden information from RSBD for different applications imposes significant computational challenges. Clustering is an important data mining technique widely used in processing and analyzing remote sensing imagery. However, conventional clustering algorithms are designed for relatively small datasets. When applied to problems with RSBD, they are, in general, too slow or inefficient for practical use. In this paper, we proposed a parallel subsampling-based clustering (PARSUC) method for improving the performance of RSBD clustering in terms of both efficiency and accuracy",
