    "description": "A validated set of North American English pseudo-words for evaluating emotion processing | Second Language Psycholinguistics | [ Second language psycholinguistics ] | The Hoosier Vocal Emotions Corpus | The \"Hoosier Vocal Emotions Corpus\" is a stimulus set of recorded pseudo-words based on the pronunciation rules of English. The corpus contains 73 controlled audio pseudo-words uttered by two actresses in five different emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust) and in a neutral tone, yielding 1,763 audio files. In Darcy & Fontaine (2019, Behavior Research Methods), viewable at this link: https://rdcu.be/bQk7G, we describe the corpus as well as a validation study of the pseudo-words. A total of 96 native English speakers completed a forced-choice emotion identification task. All emotions were recognized better than chance overall, with substantial variability among the different tokens",
