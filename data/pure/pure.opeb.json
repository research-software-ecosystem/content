PURE has a web interface by which users can add/delete their preferred articles. Once articles are registered, PURE then performs model-based clustering of the preferred articles and recommends the highly-rated articles by the prediction using the trained model. PURE updates the PubMed articles and reports the recommendation by email on daily-base. This system will be helpful for biologists to reduce the time required for gathering information from PubMed. PURE is downloadable under GPL license, via www.bic.kyoto-u.ac.jp/pathway/mami/out/PURE.tar.gz.","authors":["Yoneya T.","Mamitsuka H."],"cit_count":8,"journal":"Genome informatics.
