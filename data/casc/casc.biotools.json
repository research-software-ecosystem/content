    "description": "The Implementation of the Colored Abstract Simplicial Complex and its Application to Mesh Generation | Colored Abstract Simplicial Complex Library | Colored Abstract Simplicial Complex (CASC) Library | CASC is a modern and header-only C++ library which provides a data structure to represent arbitrary dimension abstract simplicial complexes with user-defined classes stored directly on the simplices at each dimension. This is achieved by taking advantage of the combinatorial nature of simplicial complexes and new C++ code features such as: variadic templates and automatic function return type deduction. Essentially CASC stores the full topology of the complex according to a Hasse diagram. The representation of the topology is decoupled from interactions of user data through the use of metatemplate programming",

This is accomplished by using the latest C++ language features including variadic template parameters introduced in C++11 and automatic function return type deduction from C++14. Effectively, CASC decouples the representation of the topology from the interactions of user data. We present the innovations and design principles of the data structure and related algorithms. This includes a metadata-aware decimation algorithm, which is general for collapsing simplices of any dimension. We also present an example application of this library to represent an orientable surface mesh.",
