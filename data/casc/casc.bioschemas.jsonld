      "sc:description": "The Implementation of the Colored Abstract Simplicial Complex and its Application to Mesh Generation | Colored Abstract Simplicial Complex Library | Colored Abstract Simplicial Complex (CASC) Library | CASC is a modern and header-only C++ library which provides a data structure to represent arbitrary dimension abstract simplicial complexes with user-defined classes stored directly on the simplices at each dimension. This is achieved by taking advantage of the combinatorial nature of simplicial complexes and new C++ code features such as: variadic templates and automatic function return type deduction. Essentially CASC stores the full topology of the complex according to a Hasse diagram. The representation of the topology is decoupled from interactions of user data through the use of metatemplate programming",
