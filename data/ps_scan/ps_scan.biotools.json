    "description": "ps_scan (ScanProsite tool) is a perl program used to scan one or several patterns, rules and/or profiles from PROSITE against one or several protein sequnces in Swiss-Prot or FASTA format. It requires two compiled external programs from the PFTOOLS package : \u201cpfscan\u201d used to scan a sequence against a profile library and \u201cpsa2msa\u201d which is necessary for the \u201c-o msa\u201d output format only.",

However, none of them, to our knowledge, wholly implements the PROSITE syntax, or satisfies all the rules for scanning a pattern against a sequence. We hereby propose a strict definition of how a PROSITE pattern is to be scanned against a sequence, and provide a reference implementation of a tool to scan PROSITE patterns, rules and profiles against protein sequences.",
