However, none of them, to our knowledge, wholly implements the PROSITE syntax, or satisfies all the rules for scanning a pattern against a sequence. We hereby propose a strict definition of how a PROSITE pattern is to be scanned against a sequence, and provide a reference implementation of a tool to scan PROSITE patterns, rules and profiles against protein sequences.","authors":["Gattiker A.","Gasteiger E.","Bairoch A."],"cit_count":345,"journal":"Applied bioinformatics","pmid":"15130850","title":"ScanProsite: a reference implementation of a PROSITE scanning tool.","type":"Primary","year":"2002-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ps_scan","biotoolsID":"ps_scan","description":"ps_scan (ScanProsite tool) is a perl program used to scan one or several patterns, rules and/or profiles from PROSITE against one or several protein sequnces in Swiss-Prot or FASTA format.
