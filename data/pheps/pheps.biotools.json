                "abstract": "PHEPS (pH-dependent Protein Electrostatics Server) is a web service for fast prediction and experiment planning support, as well as for correlation and analysis of experimentally obtained results, reflecting charge-dependent phenomena in globular proteins. Its implementation is based on long-term experience (PHEI package) and the need to explain measured physicochemical characteristics the level of protein atomic structure. The approach is semi-empirical and based on a mean field scheme for description and evaluation of global and local pH-dependent electrostatic properties: protein proton binding; ionic sites proton population; free energy electrostatic term; ionic groups proton affinities (pKa,i) and their Coulomb interaction with whole charge multipole; electrostatic potential of whole molecule at fixed pH and pH-dependent local electrostatic potentials at user-defined set of points. The speed of calculation is based on fast determination of distance-dependent pair charge-charge interactions as empirical three exponential function that covers charge-charge, charge-dipole and dipole-dipole contributions. After atomic coordinates input, all standard parameters are used as defaults to facilitate non-experienced users. Special attention was given to interactive addition of non-polypeptide charges, extra ionizable groups with intrinsic pKas or fixed ions. The output information is given as plain-text, readable by 'RasMol', 'Origin' and the like. The PHEPS server is accessible at http://pheps.orgchm. bas.bg/home.html. \u00a9 The Author 2006.
