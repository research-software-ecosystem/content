The method is based on accumulation of minor alleles of rare or uncommon markers discovered through dense genotyping or resequencing data. Association analyses are based on gene- or other pre-defined regions, determined by analyst.","homepage":"https://www.geenivaramu.ee/en/tools/granvil","name":"GRANVIL"}}
