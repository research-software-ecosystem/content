    "description": "The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem.  An ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation.",
