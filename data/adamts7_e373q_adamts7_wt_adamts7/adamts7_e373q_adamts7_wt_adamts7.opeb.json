CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) and CRHR2 are mammalian G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) with high affinity for CRH and the CRH family of peptides. CRHR1 is predominantly expressed in the brain and plays a vital role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress responses by secreting adrenal corticotropic hormone (ACTH). CRHR2 is predominantly expressed in the periphery and urocortin 2 (UCN2), a CRHR2-specific ligand, has been involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. Ucn-2, a 38 aa peptide, shows reasonable homology between rat and human CRH (∼34%), Ucn-1 (43%) and Ucn-3 (37 40%)","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6698788/","name":"ADAMTS7 E373Q ADAMTS7 WT ADAMTS7"}}
