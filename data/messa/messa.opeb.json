MESSA uses multiple well-established tools to offer consensus-based predictions on important aspects of protein sequence analysis. Being freely available for noncommercial users and with a user-friendly interface, MESSA serves as an umbrella platform that overcomes the absence of a comprehensive tool for predictive protein analysis. This article reveals how to access MESSA via the Web and shows how to input a protein sequence to analyze using the MESSA web server","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31524991","name":"MESSA"}}
