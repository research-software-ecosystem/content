By fully adopting capabilities of modern web browsers, such as WebGL, for molecular graphics, the viewer can interactively display large molecular complexes and is also unaffected by the retirement of third-party plug-ins like Flash and Java Applets. Generally, the web application offers comprehensive molecular visualization through a graphical user interface so that life scientists can easily access and profit from available structural data. It supports common structural fileformats (e.g. PDB, mmCIF) and a variety of molecular representations (e.g. 'cartoon, spacefill, licorice'). Moreover, the viewer can be embedded in other web sites to provide specialized visualizations of entries in structural databases or results of structure-related calculations.","authors":["Rose A.S.","Hildebrand P.W."],"cit_count":110,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkv402","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"NGL Viewer: A web application for molecular visualization","type":"Primary","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ngl_viewer","biotoolsID":"ngl_viewer","description":"Web application for molecular visualization.
