description: DOQTL is a quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping pipeline designed for
  Diversity Outbred mice and other multi-parent outbred populations. The package reads
  in data from genotyping arrays and perform haplotype reconstruction using a hidden
  Markov model (HMM). The haplotype probabilities from the HMM are then used to perform
  linkage mapping. When founder sequences are available, DOQTL can use the haplotype
  reconstructions to impute the founder sequences onto DO genomes and perform association
  mapping.
