Preservation of faecal samples for microbiome studies is therefore an important step, particularly in tropical regions where resources are limited and high temperatures may significantly influence microbiota profiles. Freezing is the accepted standard to preserve faecal samples however, cold chain methods are often unfeasible in fieldwork scenarios particularly in low and middle-income countries and alternatives are required.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'stool', 'time-to-freezing', 'microbiome' (bio.tools/microbiome), 'fieldwork'","homepage":"https://support.illumina.com/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/16s/16s-metagenomic-library-prep-guide-15044223-b.pdf","name":"16S"}}
