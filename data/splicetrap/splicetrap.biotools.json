    "description": "SpliceTrap is a statistic tool for quantifying exon inclusion ratios in paired-end RNA-seq data. Instead of full transcript quantification, SpliceTrap approaches to exon inclusion level estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. For every exon it quantifies the extent to which it is included, skipped or subjected to size variations due to alternative 3\u2019/5\u2019 splice sites or Intron Retention.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Alternative splicing (AS) is a pre-mRNA maturation process leading to the expression of multiple mRNA variants from the same primary transcript. More than 90% of human genes are expressed via AS. Therefore, quantifying the inclusion level of every exon is crucial for generating accurate transcriptomic maps and studying the regulation of AS. Results: Here we introduce SpliceTrap, a method to quantify exon inclusion levels using paired-end RNA-seq data. Unlike other tools, which focus on full-length transcript isoforms, SpliceTrap approaches the expression-level estimation of each exon as an independent Bayesian inference problem. In addition, SpliceTrap can identify major classes of alternative splicing events under a single cellular condition, without requiring a background set of reads to estimate relative splicing changes. We tested SpliceTrap both by simulation and real data analysis, and compared it to state-of-the-art tools for transcript quantification. SpliceTrap demonstrated improved accuracy, robustness and reliability in quantifying exon-inclusion ratios. Conclusions: SpliceTrap is a useful tool to study alternative splicing regulation, especially for accurate quantification of local exoninclusion ratios from RNA-seq data. \u00a9 The Author 2011.
