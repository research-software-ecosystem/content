description: mvGST provides platform-independent tools to identify GO terms (gene
  sets) that are differentially active (up or down) in multiple contrasts of interest.  Given
  a matrix of one-sided p-values (rows for genes, columns for contrasts), mvGST uses
  meta-analytic methods to combine p-values for all genes annotated to each gene set,
  and then classify each gene set as being significantly more active (1), less active
  (-1), or not significantly differentially active (0) in each contrast of interest.  With
  multiple contrasts of interest, each gene set is assigned to a profile (across contrasts)
  of differential activity.  Tools are also provided for visualizing (in a GO graph)
  the gene sets classified to a given profile.
