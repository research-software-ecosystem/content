    "description": "Anncolvar builds a feed-forward neural network for approximation of a collective variable of a molecular system. Molecular simulations are slow due to fact that a studied system tends to stay in local energy minima. Methods such as metadynamics address this problem by application of artificial forces acting on collective variables. Collective variables are some descriptors of the state of the molecular system. For example, when simulation binding of a ligand to protein it is possible to use their distance as a collective variable and by applying force onto this collective variable you can accelerate binding and unbinding. However, some sophisticated collective variables are difficult to calculate. For this purpose we developed Anncolvar to approximate such collective variables using artificial neural network.",

These low-dimensional descriptors of molecular structure can be used to monitor the state of the simulation, to calculate free energy profiles or to accelerate rare events by a bias potential or a bias force. Frequent calculation of some complex collective variables may slow down the simulation or analysis of trajectories. Moreover, many collective variables cannot be explicitly calculated for newly sampled structures. In order to address this problem, we developed a new package called anncolvar. This package makes it possible to build and train an artificial neural network model that approximates a collective variable. It can be used to generate an input for the open-source enhanced sampling simulation PLUMED package, so the collective variable can be monitored and biased by methods available in this program. The computational efficiency and the accuracy of anncolvar are demonstrated on selected molecular systems (cyclooctane derivative, Trp-cage miniprotein) and selected collective variables (Isomap, molecular surface area).",
