The tests are based on probabilities of rare variant sharing by relatives under the null hypothesis of absence of linkage and association between the rare variants and the phenotype and apply to single variants or multiple variants in a region (e.g. gene-based test).\n\nExomeSeq, Genetics, GenomeWideAssociation, ImmunoOncology, Software, VariantDetection, WholeGenome.",
