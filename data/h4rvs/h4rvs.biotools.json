The tests are based on probabilities of rare variant sharing by relatives under the null hypothesis of absence of linkage and association between the rare variants and the phenotype and apply to single variants or multiple variants in a region (e.g. gene-based test).\n\nExomeSeq, Genetics, GenomeWideAssociation, ImmunoOncology, Software, VariantDetection, WholeGenome.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: Family-based sequencing studies enable researchers to identify highly penetrant genetic variants too rare to be tested in conventional case-control studies, by studying co-segregation of variant and disease phenotypes. When multiple affected subjects in a family are sequenced, the probability that a variant or a set of variants is shared identical-by-descent by some or all affected relatives provides evidence against the null hypothesis of complete absence of linkage and association. The Rare Variant Sharing software package RVS implements a suite of tools to assess association and linkage between rare genetic variants and a dichotomous disease indicator in family pedigrees. Availability and Implementation: RVS is available as open source software from the Bioconductor webpage at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RVS.html. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
