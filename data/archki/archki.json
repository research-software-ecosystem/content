                "abstract": "A structural classification of loops has been obtained from a set of 141 protein structures classified as kinases. A total of 1813 loops was classified into 133 subclasses (9 \u03b2\u03b2links, 15 \u03b2\u03b2 hairpins, 31 \u03b1-\u03b1, 46 \u03b1-\u03b2 and 32 \u03b2-\u03b1). Functional information and specific features relating subclasses and function were included in the classification. Functional loops such as the P-loop (shared by different folds) or the Gly-rich-loop, among others, were classified into structural motifs. As a result, a common mechanism of catalysis and substrate binding was proved for most kinases. Additionally, the multiple-alignment of loop sequences made within each subclass was shown to be useful for comparative modeling of kinase loops. \u00a9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",
