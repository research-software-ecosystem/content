A total of 1813 loops was classified into 133 subclasses (9 \u03b2\u03b2links, 15 \u03b2\u03b2 hairpins, 31 \u03b1-\u03b1, 46 \u03b1-\u03b2 and 32 \u03b2-\u03b1). Functional information and specific features relating subclasses and function were included in the classification. Functional loops such as the P-loop (shared by different folds) or the Gly-rich-loop, among others, were classified into structural motifs. As a result, a common mechanism of catalysis and substrate binding was proved for most kinases. Additionally, the multiple-alignment of loop sequences made within each subclass was shown to be useful for comparative modeling of kinase loops. \u00a9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 18, "authors": [{"name": "Fernandez-Fuentes N."}, {"name": "Hermoso A."}, {"name": "Espadaler J."}, {"name": "Querol E."}, {"name": "Aviles F.X."}, {"name": "Oliva B."}], "date": "2004-08-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://sbi.imim.es/cgi-bin/archdb/loops.pl?con=1", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:archki", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinf.uab.es/cgi-bin/archki/loops.pl?class=all&set=ArchKI", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:11:17Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool performs a structural classification of kinase loops with information of functional residues to find relationships between structure and function of classified kinase-loops.", "toolType": ["Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/archki-classification-common-functional-loops-kinase-super-families.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "archki", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:27Z", "name": "ArchKI", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinf.uab.es/cgi-bin/archki/loops.pl?class=all", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
