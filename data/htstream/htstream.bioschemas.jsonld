  "sc:description": "HTStream is a quality control and processing pipeline for High Throughput Sequencing data. The difference between HTStream and other tools is that HTStream uses a tab delimited fastq format that allows for streaming from application to application. This streaming creates some awesome efficiencies when processing HTS data and makes it fully interoperable with other standard Linux tools.",
