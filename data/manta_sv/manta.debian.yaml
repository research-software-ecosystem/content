  description: structural variant and indel caller for mapped sequencing data
  long_description: " Manta calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped\
    \ paired-end\n sequencing reads. It is optimized for analysis of germline variation\
    \ in\n small sets of individuals and somatic variation in tumor/normal sample\n\
    \ pairs. Manta discovers, assembles and scores large-scale SVs, medium-\n sized\
    \ indels and large insertions within a single efficient workflow.\n The method\
    \ is designed for rapid analysis on standard compute hardware:\n NA12878 at 50x\
    \ genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 minutes on a\n 20 core server,\
    \ and most WGS tumor/normal analyses can be completed\n within 2 hours. Manta\
    \ combines paired and split-read evidence during SV\n discovery and scoring to\
    \ improve accuracy, but does not require split-\n reads or successful breakpoint\
    \ assemblies to report a variant in cases\n where there is strong evidence otherwise.\
    \ It provides scoring models for\n germline variants in small sets of diploid\
    \ samples and somatic variants\n in matched tumor/normal sample pairs. There is\
    \ experimental support for\n analysis of unmatched tumor samples as well. Manta\
    \ accepts input read\n mappings from BAM or CRAM files and reports all SV and\
    \ indel inferences\n in VCF 4.1 format."
