All rights reserved. We describe Manta, a method to discover structural variants and indels from next generation sequencing data. Manta is optimized for rapid germline and somatic analysis, calling structural variants, medium-sized indels and large insertions on standard compute hardware in less than a tenth of the time that comparable methods require to identify only subsets of these variant types: for example NA12878 at 50\u00d7 genomic coverage is analyzed in less than 20 min. Manta can discover and score variants based on supporting paired and split-read evidence, with scoring models optimized for germline analysis of diploid individuals and somatic analysis of tumor-normal sample pairs. Call quality is similar to or better than comparable methods, as determined by pedigree consistency of germline calls and comparison of somatic calls to COSMIC database variants. Manta consistently assembles a higher fraction of its calls to base-pair resolution, allowing for improved downstream annotation and analysis of clinical significance. We provide Manta as a community resource to facilitate practical and routine structural variant analysis in clinical and research sequencing scenarios.", "citationCount": 99, "authors": [{"name": "Chen X."}, {"name": "Schulz-Trieglaff O."}, {"name": "Shaw R."}, {"name": "Barnes B."}, {"name": "Schlesinger F."}, {"name": "Kallberg M."}, {"name": "Cox A.J."}, {"name": "Kruglyak S."}, {"name": "Saunders C.T."}], "date": "2016-04-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.illumina.com/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:manta_sv", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/Illumina/manta", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Variant calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3227"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/manta-structural-variant-and-indel-caller-for-mapped-sequencing-data.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "manta_sv", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:50:36Z", "name": "Manta", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/Illumina/manta/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}, {"url": "https://github.com/Illumina/manta/blob/master/docs/userGuide/README.md", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
