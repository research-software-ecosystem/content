      "sc:description": "The gene structure and super-hypervariability of the complete Penaeus monodon Dscam gene.\n\nPmDscam is a tool for sequence alignment of hypervariable shrimp Dscam (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule).\n\nUsing NGS and Sanger sequencing, a 260-kbp Dscam genome draft from Black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) was completed. Based on our analysis, hypervariability of PmDscam occurs both on the extracellular region and the cytoplasmic tail. From one PmDscam genome locus and through alternative splicing, there are 54,756 potential combinations involving extracellular regions, plus 512 potential combinations of cytoplasmic tails. Therefore, PmDscam has super-hypervariability all derived from one PmDscam genome locus.",
