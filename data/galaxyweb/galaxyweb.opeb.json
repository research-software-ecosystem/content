The GalaxyWEB server predicts protein structure from sequence by template-based modeling and refines loop or terminus regions by ab initio modeling. This web server is based on the method tested in CASP9 (9th Critical Assessment of techniques for protein Structure Prediction) as 'Seok-server', which was assessed to be among top performing template-based modeling servers. The method generates reliable core structures from multiple templates and re-builds unreliable loops or termini by using an optimization-based refinement method. In addition to structure prediction, a user can also submit a refinement only job by providing a starting model structure and locations of loops or termini to refine. The web server can be freely accessed at http://galaxy.seoklab.org/. © 2012 The Author(s).","authors":["Ko J.","Park H.","Heo L.","Seok C."],"cit_count":79,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22649060","title":"GalaxyWEB server for protein structure prediction and refinement","year":"2012-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:galaxyweb","biotoolsID":"galaxyweb","description":"GalaxyWeb is a webserver for predicting protein structure from sequence by template based modeling.
