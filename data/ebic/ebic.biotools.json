The major contribution of this paper is adding a full support for multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) support, which makes it possible to run efficiently large genomic data mining analyses. Multiple enhancements to the first release of the algorithm include integration with R and Bioconductor, and an option to exclude missing values from the analysis. Results: Evolutionary-based BIClustering was applied to datasets of different sizes, including a large DNA methylation dataset with 436 444 rows. For the largest dataset we observed over 6.6-fold speedup in computation time on a cluster of eight GPUs compared to running the method on a single GPU. This proves high scalability of the method.",
