A pre-requisite to clustering noisy data, such as gene-expression data, is the filtering step. As an alternative to this step, the ctsGE R-package applies a sorting step in which all of the data are divided into small groups. The groups are divided according to how the time points are related to the time-series median. Then clustering is performed separately on each group. Thus, the clustering is done in two steps. First, an expression index (i.e. a sequence of 1, 1 and 0) is defined and genes with the same index are grouped together, and then each group of genes is clustered by k-means to create subgroups. The ctsGE package also provides an interactive tool to visualize and explore the gene-expression patterns and their subclusters. ctsGE proposes a way of organizing and exploring expression data without eliminating valuable information.
