  "sc:description": "Functions implementing the Significance Analysis of Prognostic Signatures method that provides a robust method for identifying biologically significant gene sets associated with patient survival. Three basic statistics are computed: P_pure, P_random and a pre-ranked Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). A score is calculated to summarize the three statistics, and optionally a Q-value is computed to estimate the significance.",
