MetaCyc is a review-level database in that a given entry in MetaCyc often integrates information from multiple literature sources. The pathways in MetaCyc were determined experimentally, and are labeled with the species in which they are known to occur based on literature references examined to date. MetaCyc contains extensive commentary and literature citations. Applications of MetaCyc include pathway analysis of genomes, metabolic engineering and biochemistry education. MetaCyc is queried using the Pathway Tools graphical user interface, which provides a wide variety of query operations and visualization tools. MetaCyc is available via the World Wide Web at http://ecocyc.org/ecocyc/metacyc.html, and is available for local installation as a binary program for the PC and the Sun workstation, and as a set of flatfiles. Contact metacyc-info\u03b1i.sri.com for information on obtaining a local copy of MetaCyc.",
