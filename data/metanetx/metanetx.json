The MetaNetX.org website (http://www.metanetx.org/) provides access to these integrated data as well as a variety of tools that allow users to import their own GSMNs, map them to the MNXref reconciliation, and manipulate, compare, analyze, simulate (using flux balance analysis) and export the resulting GSMNs.

The development of such reconstructions involves the integration of information on reactions and metabolites from the scientific literature as well as public databases and existing genome-scale metabolic models. The reconciliation of discrepancies between data from these sources generally requires significant manual curation, which constitutes a major obstacle in efforts to develop and apply genome-scalemetabolic network reconstructions. In this work, we discuss some of the major difficulties encountered in the mapping and reconciliation of metabolic resources and review three recent initiatives that aim to accelerate this process, namely BKM-react, MetRxn and MNXref (presented in this article). Each of these resources provides a pre-compiled reconciliation of many of themost commonly usedmetabolic resources. By reducing the time required for manual curation of metabolite and reaction discrepancies, these resources aim to accelerate the development and application of high-quality genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions and models. \u00a9 The Author 2012.
