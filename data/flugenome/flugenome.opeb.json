The viral genome consists of eight RNA segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment. A complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment. Specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available, which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range, virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. To meet this need, we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza A genotypes and implemented a web server, FluGenome (http://www.flugenome.org/), for the assignment of lineages and genotypes. FluGenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes. These features make FluGenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza A virus evolution. © 2007 The Author(s).","authors":["Lu G.","Rowley T.","Garten R.","Donis R.O."],"cit_count":60,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"17537820","title":"FluGenome: A web tool for genotyping influenza A virus","year":"2007-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:flugenome","biotoolsID":"flugenome","description":"Tool for determining lineages and genotypes of influenza A viruses.","homepage":"http://www.flugenome.org/","name":"FluGenome"}}
