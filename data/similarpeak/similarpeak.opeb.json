The aggregation of ChIP-Seq enrichment signal in a metagene plot is an approach commonly used to summarize data complexity and to obtain a high level visual representation of the general occupancy pattern of a protein. Here we present the R package metagene, the graphical interface Imetagene and the companion package similaRpeak. Together, they provide a framework to integrate, summarize and compare the ChIP-Seq enrichment signal from complex experimental designs. Those packages identify and quantify similarities or dissimilarities in patterns between large numbers of ChIP-Seq profiles. We used metagene to investigate the differential occupancy of regulatory factors at noncoding regulatory regions (promoters and enhancers) in relation to transcriptional activity in GM12878 B-lymphocytes. The relationships between occupancy patterns and transcriptional activity suggest two different mechanisms of action for transcriptional control: i) a “gradient effect” where the regulatory factor occupancy levels follow transcription and ii) a “threshold effect” where the regulatory factor occupancy levels max out prior to reaching maximal transcription. metagene, Imetagene and similaRpeak are implemented in R under the Artistic license 2.0 and are available on Bioconductor.","authors":["Joly Beauparlant C.","Lamaze F.C.","Deschenes A.","Samb R.","Lemacon A.","Belleau P.","Bilodeau S.","Droit A."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004751","journal":"PLoS Computational Biology","title":"metagene Profiles Analyses Reveal Regulatory Element’s Factor-Specific Recruitment Patterns","type":"Primary","year":"2016-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:similarpeak","biotoolsID":"similarpeak","description":"This package calculates metrics which assign a level of similarity between ChIP-Seq profiles.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/similaRpeak.html","name":"similaRpeak","version":["1.6.0"]}}
