description: De novo identification and extraction of differentially methylated regions
  (DMRs) from the human genome using Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) and
  Illumina Infinium Array (450K and EPIC) data. Provides functionality for filtering
  probes possibly confounded by SNPs and cross-hybridisation. Includes GRanges generation
  and plotting functions.
