A method was developed, called serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), that allows the quantitative and simultaneous analysis of a large number of transcripts. To demonstrate this strategy, short diagnostic sequence tags were isolated from pancreas, concatenated, and cloned. Manual sequencing of 1000 tags revealed a gene expression pattern characteristic of pancreatic function. New pancreatic transcripts corresponding to novel tags were identified. SAGE should provide a broadly applicable means for the quantitative cataloging and comparison of expressed genes in a variety of normal, developmental, and disease states.","authors":["Velculescu V.E.","Zhang L.","Vogelstein B.","Kinzler K.W."],"cit_count":3382,"journal":"Science","pmid":"7570003","title":"Serial analysis of gene expression","year":"1995-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sagenet","biotoolsID":"sagenet","description":"Simultaneous expression and map information.","homepage":"http://www.sagenet.org/","name":"SAGE Home Page"}}
