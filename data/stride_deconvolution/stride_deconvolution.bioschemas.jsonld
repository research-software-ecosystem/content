Besides the cell-type composition deconvolution, STRIDE also provides several downstream analysis functions, including  signature (i.e., topic) detection and visualization,  spatial clustering and domain identification based on neighborhood cell populations and reconstruction of three-dimensional architecture from sequential ST slides of the same tissue.",
