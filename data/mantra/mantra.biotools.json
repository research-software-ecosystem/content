                "abstract": "Elucidation of molecular targets of a compound [mode of action (MoA)- and its off-targets is a crucial step in drug development. We developed an online collaborative resource (MANTRA 2.0) that supports this process by exploiting similarities between drug-induced transcriptional profiles. Drugs are organized in a network of nodes (drugs) and edges (similarities) highlighting 'communities' of drugs sharing a similar MoA. A user can upload gene expression profiles before and after drug treatment in one or multiple cell types. An automated processing pipeline transforms the gene expression profiles into a unique drug 'node' embedded in the drug-network. Visual inspection of the neighbouring drugs and communities helps in revealing its MoA and to suggest new applications of known drugs (drug repurposing). MANTRA 2.0 allows storing and sharing user-generated network nodes, thus making MANTRA 2.0 a collaborative ever-growing resource. \u00a9 2014 The Author. Published by Oxford University Press.
