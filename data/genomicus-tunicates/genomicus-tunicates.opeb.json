Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.ANISEED (https://www.aniseed.cnrs.fr) is the main model organism database for the worldwide community of scientists working on tunicates, the vertebrate sister-group. Information provided for each species includes functionally-annotated gene and transcript models with orthology relationships within tunicates, and with echinoderms, cephalochordates and vertebrates. Beyond genes the system describes other genetic elements, including repeated elements and cis-regulatory modules. Gene expression profiles for several thousand genes are formalized in both wild-type and experimentally-manipulated conditions, using formal anatomical ontologies. These data can be explored through three complementary types of browsers, each offering a different view-point. A developmental browser summarizes the information in a gene- or territory-centric manner. Advanced genomic browsers integrate the genetic features surrounding genes or gene sets within a species. A Genomicus synteny browser explores the conservation of local gene order across deuterostome. This new release covers an extended taxonomic range of 14 species, including for the first time a non-ascidian species, the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica. Functional annotations, provided for each species, were enhanced through a combination of manual curation of gene models and the development of an improved orthology detection pipeline. Finally, gene expression profiles and anatomical territories can be explored in 4D online through the newly developed Morphonet morphogenetic browser.","authors":["Dardaillon J.","Dauga D.","Simion P.","Faure E.","Onuma T.A.","DeBiasse M.B.","Louis A.","Nitta K.R.","Naville M.","Besnardeau L.","Reeves W.","Wang K.","Fagotto M.","Gueroult-Bellone M.","Fujiwara S.","Dumollard R.","Veeman M.","Volff J.-N.","Roest Crollius H.","Douzery E.","Ryan J.F.","Davidson B.","Nishida H.","Dantec C.","Lemaire P."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkz955","journal":"Nucleic acids research","title":"ANISEED 2019: 4D exploration of genetic data for an extended range of tunicates","type":"Usage","year":"2020-01-08"},{"abstract":"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.ANISEED (www.aniseed.cnrs.fr) is the main model organism database for tunicates, the sister-group of vertebrates. This release gives access to annotated genomes, gene expression patterns, and anatomical descriptions for nine ascidian species. It provides increased integration with external molecular and taxonomy databases, better support for epigenomics datasets, in particular RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and SELEX-seq, and features novel interactive interfaces for existing and novel datatypes. In particular, the cross-species navigation and comparison is enhanced through a novel taxonomy section describing each represented species and through the implementation of interactive phylogenetic gene trees for 60% of tunicate genes. The gene expression section displays the results of RNA-seq experiments for the three major model species of solitary ascidians. Gene expression is controlled by the binding of transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences. A high-resolution description of the DNA-binding specificity for 131 Ciona robusta (formerly C. intestinalis type A) transcription factors by SELEX-seq is provided and used to map candidate binding sites across the Ciona robusta and Phallusia mammillata genomes. Finally, use of a WashU Epigenome browser enhances genome navigation, while a Genomicus server was set up to explore microsynteny relationships within tunicates and with vertebrates, Amphioxus, echinoderms and hemichordates.","authors":["Brozovic M.","Dantec C.","Dardaillon J.","Dauga D.","Faure E.","Gineste M.","Louis A.","Naville M.","Nitta K.R.","Piette J.","Reeves W.","Scornavacca C.","Simion P.","Vincentelli R.","Bellec M.","Aicha S.B.","Fagotto M.","Gueroult-Bellone M.","Haeussler M.","Jacox E.","Lowe E.K.","Mendez M.","Roberge A.","Stolfi A.","Yokomori R.","Brown C.T.","Cambillau C.","Christiaen L.","Delsuc F.","Douzery E.","Dumollard R.","Kusakabe T.","Nakai K.","Nishida H.","Satou Y.","Swalla B.","Veeman M.","Volff J.-N.","Lemaire P."],"cit_count":22,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx1108","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"ANISEED 2017: Extending the integrated ascidian database to the exploration and evolutionary comparison of genome-scale datasets","type":"Usage","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Genomicus-tunicates","biotoolsID":"Genomicus-tunicates","description":"Genomicus-tunicates is a genome browser that enables users to navigate in tunicates genomes in several dimensions: linearly along chromosome axes, transversaly across different species, and chronologicaly along evolutionary time.
