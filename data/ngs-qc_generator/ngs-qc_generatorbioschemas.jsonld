  "sc:description": "Comparative analysis between ChIP-seq and other enrichment-related NGS datasets requires prior characterization of their degree of technical similarity. The Galaxy tool NGS-QC Generator is a computational-based approach that infers quality indicators from the distribution of sequenced reads associated to a particular NGS profile. Such information is then used for comparative purposes and for defining strategies to improve the quality of sample-derived datasets.",
