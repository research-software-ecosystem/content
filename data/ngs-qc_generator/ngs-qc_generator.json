In systems biology-based approaches several of these readouts are generally cumulated with the aim of describing living systems through a reconstitution of the genome-regulatory functions. However, an issue that is often underestimated is that conclusions drawn from such multidimensional analyses of NGS-derived datasets critically depend on the quality of the compared datasets. To address this problem, we have developed the NGS-QC Generator, a quality control system that infers quality descriptors for any kind of ChIP-sequencing and related datasets. In this chapter we provide a detailed protocol for (1) assessing quality descriptors with the NGS-QC Generator; (2) to interpret the generated reports; and (3) to explore the database of QC indicators (www.ngs-qc.org) for >21,000 publicly available datasets.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Mendoza-Parra M.A."}, {"name": "Saleem M.-A.M."}, {"name": "Blum M."}, {"name": "Cholley P.-E."}, {"name": "Gronemeyer H."}], "date": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "contact@ngs-qc.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ngs-qc_generator", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ngs-qc.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequencing quality control", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3218"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-09-04T08:38:20Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Comparative analysis between ChIP-seq and other enrichment-related NGS datasets requires prior characterization of their degree of technical similarity.
