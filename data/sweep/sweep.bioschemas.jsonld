  "sc:description": "Allows large-scale analysis of haplotype structure in genomes for the primary purpose of detecting evidence of natural selection. Primarily, it uses the Long Range Haplotype (LRH) test to look for alleles of high frequency with long-range linkage disequilibrium (LD), which suggest the haplotype rapidly rose to high frequency before recombination could break down associations with nearby markers",
