In our Hyppo-X framework, we have capability to define a category of a point using single or multiple columns of the dataset. Pie chart shows the percentage distribution of points among all categories. For instance, for the above sample dataset, we can define the locaion column named Loc as the category of all the points then we will get following graphs. Here, blue color indicates points those belong in location N and red color indicates points those belong in location K. This graph with pie chart node helps us to understand the behavior of points with respect to two locations.\n\nThis software library is built to delve the insights of a complex high dimensional dataset","homepage":"https://xperthut.github.io/HYPPO-X","name":"Hyppo-X"}}
