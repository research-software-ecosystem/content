  "sc:description": "It converts genomics data into DNA k-mer words representing the regions associated with a chromatin mark, and then analyzing these k-mer sets to see how samples differ from each other. This approach is primarily intended for single cell genomics data, and was tested most extensively on single cell ATAC-seq data. The bash scripts in particular may require some alteration for other types of genomics data.",
