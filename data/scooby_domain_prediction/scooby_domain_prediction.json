The prediction method successfully identifies sequence regions that will form a globular structure and those that are likely to be unstructured. The method does not rely on homology searches and, therefore, can identify previously unknown domains for structural elucidation. Scooby-domain is available as a Java applet at http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/programs/scoobywww/. It may be used to visualize local properties within a protein sequence, such as average hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity and domain boundaries, as well as being a method for fast domain assignment of large sequence sets. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 22, "authors": [{"name": "George R.A."}, {"name": "Lin K."}, {"name": "Heringa J."}], "date": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Centre for Integrative Bioinformatics VU (IBIVU), Vrije Universiteit", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bioinf-l@few.vu.nl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:scooby_domain_prediction", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/programs/scoobywww/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein fold recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}, {"term": "Protein globularity prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0408"}, {"term": "Protein structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2487"}, {"term": "Protein domain recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0246"}, {"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Scooby-domain (sequence hydrophobicity predicts domains) is a method to identify globular domains in protein sequence, based on the observed lengths and hydrophobicities of domains from proteins with known tertiary structure.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "scooby_domain_prediction", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T14:14:52Z", "name": "Scooby Domain Prediction", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ibi.vu.nl/programs/scoobywww/info.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
