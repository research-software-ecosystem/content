The prediction method successfully identifies sequence regions that will form a globular structure and those that are likely to be unstructured. The method does not rely on homology searches and, therefore, can identify previously unknown domains for structural elucidation. Scooby-domain is available as a Java applet at http://ibivu.cs.vu.nl/programs/scoobywww/. It may be used to visualize local properties within a protein sequence, such as average hydrophobicity, secondary structure propensity and domain boundaries, as well as being a method for fast domain assignment of large sequence sets. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.",
