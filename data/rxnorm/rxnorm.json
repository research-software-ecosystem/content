By providing links between these vocabularies, RxNorm can mediate messages between systems not using the same software and vocabulary.",

RxNorm is based on a model developed at the NLM in consultation with Health level 7 vocabulary technical committee with the Veterans Administration. RxNorm organizes data by concept as it is a collection of names identical in meaning at a specified level of abstraction using concepts. It can recognize strings of characters from disparate sources of the same thing. The goal of providing one RxNorm data per month helped to understand the Java technologies Web database and utility scripting intricacies of source inversion giving efficiency.",
