It can also be used with 3D medical data of any sort: its segmentation and surface extraction facilities are particularly powerful. It can load most types of DICOM image files and has unique facilities to measure bone cortical thickness from CT data.","homepage":"http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~rwp/stradwin/","name":"Stradwin","version":["5.3"]}}
