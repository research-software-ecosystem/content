To date, the most common prediction strategies are based upon machine learning or other quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) based approaches. In the present research, we propose and discuss a straightforward strategy not based on any learning modelling but exclusively relying upon the chemical similarity of a query compound to reference compounds with annotated activity against cell lines. We also compare the performance of the proposed method to machine learning predictions on the same problem. A curated database of compounds-cell lines associations derived from ChemBL version 22 was created for algorithm construction and cross-validation.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!","homepage":"http://bioquimio.udla.edu.ec/cellfishing","name":"Cell fishing"}}
