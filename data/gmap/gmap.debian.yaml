description: This package contains the programs GMAP and GSNAP as well as utilities
  to manage genome databases in GMAP/GSNAP format. GMAP (Genomic Mapping and Alignment
  Program) is a tool for aligning EST, mRNA and cDNA sequences. GSNAP (Genomic Short-read
  Nucleotide Alignment Program) is a tool for aligning single-end and paired-end transcriptome
  reads. Both tools can use a database of * known splice sites and identify novel
  splice sites. * known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). GSNAP can align bisulfite-treated
  DNA.
