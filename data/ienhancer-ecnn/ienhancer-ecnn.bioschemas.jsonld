      "sc:description": "Identifying enhancers and their strength using ensembles of convolutional neural networks.\n\nBACKGROUND:Enhancers are non-coding DNA fragments which are crucial in gene regulation (e.g. transcription and translation). Having high locational variation and free scattering in 98% of non-encoding genomes, enhancer identification is, therefore, more complicated than other genetic factors. To address this biological issue, several in silico studies have been done to identify and classify enhancer sequences among a myriad of DNA sequences using computational advances. Although recent studies have come up with improved performance, shortfalls in these learning models still remain. To overcome limitations of existing learning models, we introduce iEnhancer-ECNN, an efficient prediction framework using one-hot encoding and k-mers for data transformation and ensembles of convolutional neural networks for model construction, to identify enhancers and classify their strength.",
