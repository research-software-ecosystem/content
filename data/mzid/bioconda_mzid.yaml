description: A parser for mzIdentML files implemented using the XML package. The parser
  tries to be general and able to handle all types of mzIdentML files with the drawback
  of having less 'pretty' output than a vendor specific parser. Please contact the
  maintainer with any problems and supply an mzIdentML file so the problems can be
  fixed quickly.
