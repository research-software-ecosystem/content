  "sc:description": "ResProx (Resolution-by-proxy or Res(p)) is a web server that predicts the atomic resolution of NMR protein structures using only PDB coordinate data as input. More specfically, ResProx uses machine learning techniques to accurately estimate (with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 between observed and calculated) the atomic resolution of a protein structure from 25 measurable features that can be derived from its atomic coordinates.",
