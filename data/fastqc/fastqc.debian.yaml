summary: quality control for high throughput sequence data
description: >
   FastQC aims to provide a simple way to do some quality control checks on
   raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing pipelines. It
   provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick
   impression of whether your data has any problems of which you should
   be aware before doing any further analysis.
   .
   The main functions of FastQC are
    * Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)
    * Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may
      be problems
    * Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data
    * Export of results to an HTML based permanent report
    * Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without
      running the interactive application
