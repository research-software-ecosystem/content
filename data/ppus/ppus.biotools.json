Developing an algorithm to identify \u03a8 sites is an important work. And it is better if the algorithm could assign which PUS modifies the \u03a8 sites. Here, we developed PPUS (http://lyh.pkmu.cn/ppus/), the first web server to predict PUS-specific \u03a8 sites. PPUS employed support vector machine as the classifier and used nucleotides around \u03a8 sites as the features. Currently, PPUS could accurately predict new \u03a8 sites for PUS1, PUS4 and PUS7 in yeast and PUS4 in human. PPUS is well designed and friendly to user.",
