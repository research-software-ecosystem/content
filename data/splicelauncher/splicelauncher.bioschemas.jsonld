It works in three steps:.\n\nSpliceLauncher comes with a ready to use config.cfg file. It contains the paths of software and files used by SpliceLauncher. The INSTALL mode of SpliceLauncher updates this config.cfg file. If you define the path to GFF (v3) file and path to the FASTA genome, the INSTALL mode will extract all necessary information from this GFF and indexing the STAR genome. This informations are stored in a BED file that contains the exon coordinates, in a sjdb file that contains the intron coordinates and a text file that contains the details of transcript structures. You need to define where these files will saving by the -O, --output argument",
