description: "CRAC is a tool to analyze High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data in comparison\
  \ to a reference genome. It is intended for transcriptomic and genomic sequencing\
  \ reads. More precisely, with transcriptomic reads as input, it predicts point mutations,\
  \ indels, splice junction, and chimeric RNAs (ie, non colinear splice junctions).\
  \ CRAC can also output positions and nature of sequence error that it detects in\
  \ the reads. CRAC uses a genome index. This index must be computed before running\
  \ the read analysis. For this sake, use the command \"crac-index\" on your genome\
  \ files. You can then process the reads using the command crac. See the man page\
  \ of CRAC (help file) by typing \"man crac\". CRAC requires large amount of main\
  \ memory on your computer. For processing against the Human genome, say 50 million\
  \ reads of 100 nucleotide each, CRAC requires about 40 gigabytes of main memory.\
  \ Check whether the system of your computing server is equipped with sufficient\
  \ amount of memory before launching an analysis.\n"
