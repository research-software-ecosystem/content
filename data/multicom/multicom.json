Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Sampling structural models and ranking them are the two major challenges of protein structure prediction. Traditional protein structure prediction methods generally use one or a few quality assessment (QA) methods to select the best-predicted models, which cannot consistently select relatively better models and rank a large number of models well. Results: Here, we develop a novel large-scale model QA method in conjunction with model clustering to rank and select protein structural models. It unprecedentedly applied 14 model QA methods to generate consensus model rankings, followed by model refinement based on model combination (i.e. averaging). Our experiment demonstrates that the large-scale model QA approach is more consistent and robust in selecting models of better quality than any individual QA method. Our method was blindly tested during the 11th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11) as MULTICOM group. It was officially ranked third out of all 143 human and server predictors according to the total scores of the first models predicted for 78 CASP11 protein domains and second according to the total scores of the best of the five models predicted for these domains. MULTICOM's outstanding performance in the extremely competitive 2014 CASP11 experiment proves that our large-scale QA approach together with model clustering is a promising solution to one of the two major problems in protein structure modeling.", "citationCount": 20, "authors": [{"name": "Cao R."}, {"name": "Bhattacharya D."}, {"name": "Adhikari B."}, {"name": "Li J."}, {"name": "Cheng J."}], "date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btq058", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Primary", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "MULTICOM: A multi-level combination approach to protein structure prediction and its assessments in CASP8", "abstract": "Motivation: Protein structure prediction is one of the most important problems in structural bioinformatics. Here we describe MULTICOM, a multi-level combination approach to improve the various steps in protein structure prediction. In contrast to those methods which look for the best templates, alignments and models, our approach tries to combine complementary and alternative templates, alignments and models to achieve on average better accuracy. Results: The multi-level combination approach was implemented via five automated protein structure prediction servers and one human predictor which participated in the eighth Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP8), 2008. The MULTICOM servers and human predictor were consistently ranked among the top predictors on the CASP8 benchmark. The methods can predict moderate- to high-resolution models for most templatebased targets and low-resolution models for some template-free targets. The results show that the multi-level combination of complementary templates, alternative alignments and similar models aided by model quality assessment can systematically improve both template-based and template-free protein modeling.
