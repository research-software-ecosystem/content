The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Interaction Browser (http://sysbio.soe.ucsc.edu/nets) is an online tool for biologists to view high-throughput data sets simultaneously for the analysis of functional relationships between biological entities. Users can access several public interaction networks and functional genomics data sets through the portal as well as upload their own networks and data sets for analysis. Users can navigate through correlative relationships for focused sets of genes belonging to biological pathways using a standard web browser. Using a new visual modality called the CircleMap, multiple 'omics' data sets can be viewed simultaneously within the context of curated, predicted, directed and undirected regulatory interactions. The Interaction Browser provides an integrative viewing of biological networks based on the consensus of many observations about genes and their products, which may provide new insights about normal and disease processes not obvious from any isolated data set.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Wong C.K."}, {"name": "Vaske C.J."}, {"name": "Ng S."}, {"name": "Sanborn J.Z."}, {"name": "Benz S.C."}, {"name": "Haussler D."}, {"name": "Stuart J.M."}], "date": "2013-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ucsc_interaction_browser", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sysbio.soe.ucsc.edu/nets", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein interaction network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0276"}, {"term": "Gene expression correlation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3463"}, {"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Online tool fo biologists to view high-throughput data sets simultaenously for the analysis of functional relationships between biological entities.
