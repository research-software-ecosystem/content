The method consists of a library of 35 pHMMs, built from the alignment of transmembrane segments of representative LGIC sequences. In addition, 14 Pfam pHMMs are used to further annotate and correctly classify unknown protein sequences into one of the 10 LGIC subfamilies","homepage":"http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/ligions/","name":"LiGIoNs"}}
