The low complexity may be preconditioned by strong inequality in nucleotide content (biased composition), by tandem or dispersed repeats or by palindrome-hairpin structures, as well as by a combination of all these factors. Several numerical measures of textual complexity, including combinatorial and linguistic ones, together with complexity estimation using a modified Lempel-Ziv algorithm, have been implemented in a software tool called 'Complexity' (http://wwwmgs.bionet.nsc.ru/mgs/programs/low_complexity/). The software enables a user to search for low-complexity regions in long sequences, e.g. complete bacterial genomes or eukaryotic chromosomes. In addition, it estimates the complexity of groups of aligned sequences. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
