about:
  description: 'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to investigate
    the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many computational challenges.
    We developed an R package SNPRelate to provide a binary format for single-nucleotide
    polymorphism (SNP) data in GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS)
    data files. The GDS format offers the efficient operations specifically designed
    for integers with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits. SNPRelate
    is also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP data using parallel
    computing for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures: Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures.
    The SNP GDS format is also used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4
    classes and generic functions. The extended GDS format is implemented in the SeqArray
    package to support the storage of single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertion/deletion
    polymorphism (indel) and structural variation calls in whole-genome and whole-exome
    variant data.'
