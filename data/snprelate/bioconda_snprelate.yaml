description: 'Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to investigate
  the genetic basis of diseases and traits, but they pose many computational challenges.
  We developed an R package SNPRelate to provide a binary format for single-nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) data in GWAS utilizing CoreArray Genomic Data Structure (GDS)
  data files. The GDS format offers the efficient operations specifically designed
  for integers with two bits, since a SNP could occupy only two bits. SNPRelate is
  also designed to accelerate two key computations on SNP data using parallel computing
  for multi-core symmetric multiprocessing computer architectures: Principal Component
  Analysis (PCA) and relatedness analysis using Identity-By-Descent measures. The
  SNP GDS format is also used by the GWASTools package with the support of S4 classes
  and generic functions. The extended GDS format is implemented in the SeqArray package
  to support the storage of single nucleotide variations (SNVs), insertion/deletion
  polymorphism (indel) and structural variation calls in whole-genome and whole-exome
  variant data.'
