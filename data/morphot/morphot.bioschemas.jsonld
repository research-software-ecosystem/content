      "sc:description": "Transport-based interpolation between EM maps with UCSF ChimeraX.\n\nMorphOT is a plugin for ChimeraX, which allows users to directly interpolate multiple density maps. It relies on adapting and optimizing for EM maps some recent methods of shape interpolation based on optimal transport (OT), resulting in significant improvement in quality of morphing, compared with the standard command provided withChimeraX. For more details on the method, please see the appendix here and the paper accompanying the software.",
