    "description": "A fast and efficient genome polishing tool for long read assembly.\n\nFast and accurately polish the genome generated by noisy long reads.\n\nNextPolish is used to fix base errors (SNV/Indel) in the genome generated by noisy long reads, it can be used with short read data only or long read data only or a combination of both. It contains two core modules, and use a stepwise fashion to correct the error bases in reference genome. To correct the raw third-generation sequencing (TGS) long reads with approximately 15-10% sequencing errors, please use NextDenovo",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Although long-read sequencing technologies can produce genomes with long contiguity, they suffer from high error rates. Thus, we developed NextPolish, a tool that efficiently corrects sequence errors in genomes assembled with long reads. This new tool consists of two interlinked modules that are designed to score and count K-mers from high quality short reads, and to polish genome assemblies containing large numbers of base errors. Results: When evaluated for the speed and efficiency using human and a plant (Arabidopsis thaliana) genomes, NextPolish outperformed Pilon by correcting sequence errors faster, and with a higher correction accuracy.",
