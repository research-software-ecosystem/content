summary: short-read assembly method to build de novo draft assembly
description: >
   SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de novo draft
   assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed to
   assemble Illumina GA short reads.
   .
   It creates new opportunities for building reference
   sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in a cost
   effective way.
