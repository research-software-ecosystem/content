PAIR predicts interactions by a fine-tuned support vector machine model that integrates indirect evidences for interaction, such as gene co-expressions, domain interactions, shared GO annotations, co-localizations, phylogenetic profile similarities and homologous interactions in other organisms (interologs). These predictions were expected to cover 24% of the entire Arabidopsis interactome, and their reliability was estimated to be 44%. Two independent example data sets were used to rigorously validate the prediction accuracy. PAIR features a userfriendly query interface, providing rich annotation on the relationships between two proteins. A graphical interaction network browser has also been integrated into the PAIR web interface to facilitate mining of specific pathways. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Lin M.","Shen X.","Chen X."],"cit_count":38,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"20952401","title":"PAIR: The predicted Arabidopsis interactome resource","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pair","biotoolsID":"pair","description":"Experimentally reported molecular interactions and predicted interactions in A. thaliana.
