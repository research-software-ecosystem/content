The processing and statistical analysis of such high-throughput data poses new challenges; currently a fair proportion of the tags are routinely discarded due to an inability to match them to a reference sequence, thereby reducing the effective throughput of the technology. Results: We propose a novel base calling algorithm using model-based clustering and probability theory to identify ambiguous bases and code them with IUPAC symbols. We also select optimal sub-tags using a score based on information content to remove uncertain bases towards the ends of the reads. Conclusion: We show that the method improves genome coverage and number of usable tags as compared with Solexa's data processing pipeline by an average of 15%. An R package is provided which allows fast and accurate base calling of Solexa's fluorescence intensity files and the production of informative diagnostic plots. \u00a9 2008 Rougemont et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 66, "authors": [{"name": "Rougemont J."}, {"name": "Amzallag A."}, {"name": "Iseli C."}, {"name": "Farinelli L."}, {"name": "Xenarios I."}, {"name": "Naef F."}], "date": "2008-10-13T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jacques Rougemont", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jacques.rougemont@epfl.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rolexa", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://master.bioconductor.org/packages//2.10/bioc/html/Rolexa.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Base-calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3185"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Allows fast and accurate base calling of Solexa's fluorescence intensity files and the production of informative diagnostic plots.", "toolType": ["Plug-in"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "rolexa", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:16:09Z", "name": "Rolexa", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://master.bioconductor.org/packages//2.10/bioc/manuals/Rolexa/man/Rolexa.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
