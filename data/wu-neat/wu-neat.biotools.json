    "description": "Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (NEAT). A clinically validated, open-source MATLAB toolbox for limited-channel neonatal EEG analysis.\n\nMany qualitative and quantitative metrics have been developed to analyze the output of limited-channel EEG recordings in neonates. A significant roadblock in the widespread dissemination of these techniques is the device-specific, \u201cblack-box\u201d nature of the analytic algorithms, preventing comparison between studies and the obsolescence of old recordings as software is abandoned. We have developed NEAT (Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox) as an open-source software platform to overcome these challenges. NEAT runs within MATLAB and is designed to work with any single-channel EEG input, regardless of source or sampling rate. The second release adds support for GNU Octave.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020Background: Limited-channel EEG research in neonates is hindered by lack of open, accessible analytic tools. To overcome this limitation, we have created the Washington University-Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (WU-NEAT), containing two of the most commonly used tools, provided in an open-source, clinically-validated package running within MATLAB. Methods: The first algorithm is the amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), which is generated by filtering, rectifying and time-compressing the original EEG recording, with subsequent semi-logarithmic display. The second algorithm is the spectral edge frequency (SEF), calculated as the critical frequency below which a user-defined proportion of the EEG spectral power is located. The aEEG algorithm was validated by three experienced reviewers. Reviewers evaluated aEEG recordings of fourteen preterm/term infants, displayed twice in random order, once using a reference algorithm and again using the WU-NEAT aEEG algorithm. Using standard methodology, reviewers assigned a background pattern classification. Inter/intra-rater reliability was assessed. For the SEF, calculations were made using the same fourteen recordings, first with the reference and then with the WU-NEAT algorithm. Results were compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: For the aEEG algorithm, intra- and inter-rater reliability was 100% and 98%, respectively. For the SEF, the mean\u00b1SD Pearson correlation coefficient between algorithms was 0.96\u00b10.04. Conclusion: We have demonstrated a clinically-validated toolbox for generating the aEEG as well as calculating the SEF from EEG data. Open-source access will enable widespread use of common analytic algorithms which are device-independent and unlikely to become outdated as technology changes, thereby facilitating future collaborative research in neonatal EEG.",
