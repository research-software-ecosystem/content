      "sc:description": "Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox (NEAT). A clinically validated, open-source MATLAB toolbox for limited-channel neonatal EEG analysis.\n\nMany qualitative and quantitative metrics have been developed to analyze the output of limited-channel EEG recordings in neonates. A significant roadblock in the widespread dissemination of these techniques is the device-specific, “black-box” nature of the analytic algorithms, preventing comparison between studies and the obsolescence of old recordings as software is abandoned. We have developed NEAT (Neonatal EEG Analysis Toolbox) as an open-source software platform to overcome these challenges. NEAT runs within MATLAB and is designed to work with any single-channel EEG input, regardless of source or sampling rate. The second release adds support for GNU Octave.",
