GROMACS is one of the most widely used open-source and free software codes in chemistry, used primarily for dynamical simulations of biomolecules. It provides a rich set of calculation types, preparation and analysis tools. Several advanced techniques for free-energy calculations are supported. In version 5, it reaches new performance heights, through several new and enhanced parallelization algorithms. These work on every level; SIMD registers inside cores, multithreading, heterogeneous CPU-GPU acceleration, state-of-the-art 3D domain decomposition, and ensemble-level parallelization through built-in replica exchange and the separate Copernicus framework. The latest best-in-class compressed trajectory storage format is supported.","authors":["Abraham M.J.","Murtola T.","Schulz R.","Pall S.","Smith J.C.","Hess B.","Lindah E."],"cit_count":1729,"doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2015.06.001","journal":"SoftwareX","title":"Gromacs: High performance molecular simulations through multi-level parallelism from laptops to supercomputers","type":"Primary","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gromacs","biotoolsID":"gromacs","description":"Versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins, lipids and nucleic acids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since it is extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.","homepage":"http://www.gromacs.org/","name":"Gromacs"}}
