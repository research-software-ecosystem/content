description: "GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate\
  \ the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.\
  \ . It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids\
  \ that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely\
  \ fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations)\
  \ many groups are also using it for research on non- biological systems, e.g. polymers.\n"
