They have recently gathered much attention as a concept to uncover structural design principles of complex biological networks. FANMOD is a tool for fast network motif detection; it relies on recently developed algorithms to improve the efficiency of network motif detection by some orders of magnitude over existing tools. This facilitates the detection of larger motifs in bigger networks than previously possible. Additional benefits of FANMOD are the ability to analyze colored networks, a graphical user interface and the ability to export results to a variety of machine- and human-readable file formats including comma-separated values and HTML. \u00a9 2006 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 363, "authors": [{"name": "Wernicke S."}, {"name": "Rasche F."}], "date": "2006-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/~wernicke/index.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:fanmod", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["20061223"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://theinf1.informatik.uni-jena.de/~wernicke/motifs/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Motif detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0239"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast Network Motif Detection is for fast network motif detection; it relies on recently developed algorithms to improve the efficiency of network motif detection by some orders of magnitude over existing tools.
