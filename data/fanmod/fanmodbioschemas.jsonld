  "sc:description": "Fast Network Motif Detection is for fast network motif detection; it relies on recently developed algorithms to improve the efficiency of network motif detection by some orders of magnitude over existing tools. This facilitates the detection of larger motifs in bigger networks than previously possible. Its additional benefits are the ability to analyze colored networks, a graphical user interface and the ability to export results to a variety of machine- and human-readable file formats.",
