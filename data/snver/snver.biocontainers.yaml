description: SNVer is a statistical tool for calling common and rare variants in analysis
  of pool or individual next-generation sequencing data. It reports one single overall
  p-value for evaluating the significance of a candidate locus being a variant, based
  on which multiplicity control can be obtained. Loci with any (low) coverage can
  be tested and depth of coverage will be quantitatively factored into final significance
  calculation. SNVer runs very fast, making it feasible for analysis of whole-exome
  sequencing data, or even whole-genome sequencing data.
