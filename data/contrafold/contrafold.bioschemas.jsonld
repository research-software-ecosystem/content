  "sc:description": "A novel secondary structure prediction method based on conditional log-linear models, a flexible class of probabilistic models which generalize upon SCFGs by using discriminative training and feature-rich scoring. The result closes the gap between probabilistic and thermodynamic models, demonstrating that statistical learning procedures provide an effective alternative to empirical measurement of thermodynamic parameters for RNA secondary structure prediction.",
