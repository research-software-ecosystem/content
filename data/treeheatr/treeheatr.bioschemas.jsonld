'treeheatr' utilizes the customizable 'ggparty' package for drawing decision trees.\n\nYou can install the released version of treeheatr from CRAN with:.\n\nThe first argument of heat_tree(), data is now replaced with x, which can be a dataframe (or tibble), a party (or constparty) object specifying the precomputed tree, or partynode object specifying the customized tree. custom_tree argument is no longer needed.\n\ntreeheatr incorporates a heatmap at the terminal node of your decision tree. The basic building blocks to a treeheatr plot are (yes, you guessed it!) a decision tree and a heatmap.",
