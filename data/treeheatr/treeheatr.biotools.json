'treeheatr' utilizes the customizable 'ggparty' package for drawing decision trees.\n\nYou can install the released version of treeheatr from CRAN with:.\n\nThe first argument of heat_tree(), data is now replaced with x, which can be a dataframe (or tibble), a party (or constparty) object specifying the precomputed tree, or partynode object specifying the customized tree. custom_tree argument is no longer needed.\n\ntreeheatr incorporates a heatmap at the terminal node of your decision tree. The basic building blocks to a treeheatr plot are (yes, you guessed it!) a decision tree and a heatmap.",

The integrated presentation of the tree structure along with an overview of the data efficiently illustrates how the tree nodes split up the feature space and how well the tree model performs. This visualization can also be examined in depth to uncover the correlation structure in the data and importance of each feature in predicting the outcome. Implemented in an easily installed package with a detailed vignette, treeheatr can be a useful teaching tool to enhance students' understanding of a simple decision tree model before diving into more complex tree-based machine learning methods.",
