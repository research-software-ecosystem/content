Query and reference compounds are populated on the network connectivity map and a graph-based neighbor counting method is applied to rank the consensus targets among the neighborhood of each query ligand. The CSNAP approach can facilitate high-throughput target discovery and off-target prediction for any compound set identified from phenotype-based or cell-based chemical screens.","homepage":"http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/CSNAP/","name":"CSNAP","version":["1.0"]}}
