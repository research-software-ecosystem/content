      "sc:description": "CSNAP is a computational approach for compound target identification based on network similarity graphs. Query and reference compounds are populated on the network connectivity map and a graph-based neighbor counting method is applied to rank the consensus targets among the neighborhood of each query ligand. The CSNAP approach can facilitate high-throughput target discovery and off-target prediction for any compound set identified from phenotype-based or cell-based chemical screens.",
