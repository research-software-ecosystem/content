Dot-bracket notation is the most common and simple representation for RNA secondary structures but its simplicity leads also to ambiguity requiring further processing steps to dissolve. Here we present BEAR (Brand nEw Alphabet for RNA), a new context-aware structural encoding represented by a string of characters. Each character in BEAR encodes for a specific secondary structure element (loop, stem, bulge and internal loop) with specific length. Furthermore, exploiting this informative and yet simple encoding in multiple alignments of related RNAs, we captured how much structural variation is tolerated in RNA families and convert it into transition rates among secondary structure elements. This allowed us to compute a substitution matrix for secondary structure elements called MBR (Matrix of BEAR-encoded RNA secondary structures), of which we tested the ability in aligning RNA secondary structures. We propose BEAR and the MBR as powerful resources for the RNA secondary structure analysis, comparison and classification, motif finding and phylogeny. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s) 2014.", "citationCount": 12, "authors": [{"name": "Mattei E."}, {"name": "Ausiello G."}, {"name": "Ferre F."}, {"name": "Helmer-Citterich M."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ELIXIR-ITA-TORVERGATA", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "citterich@uniroma2.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bear", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatica.uniroma2.it/BEAR/BEAR_Encoder.zip", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2518"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "RNA secondary structure analysis, comparison and classification, motif finding and phylogeny.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "bear", "additionDate": "2015-01-22T11:45:55Z", "name": "BEAR Brand nEw Alphabet for RNA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinformatica.uniroma2.it/BEAR/Documentation.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
