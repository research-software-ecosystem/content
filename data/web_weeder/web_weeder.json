A fundamental step in this process requires the characterization of regulatory motifs playing key roles in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In particular, transcription is modulated by the interaction of transcription factors with their corresponding binding sites. Weeder Web is a web interface to Weeder, an algorithm for the automatic discovery of conserved motifs in a set of related regulatory DNA sequences. The motifs found are in turn likely to be instances of binding sites for some transcription factor. Other than providing access to the program, the interface has been designed so to make usage of the program itself as simple as possible, and to require very little prior knowledge about the length and the conservation of the motifs to be found. In fact, the interface automatically starts different runs of the program, each one with different parameters, and provides the user with an overall summary of the results as well as some 'advice' on which motifs look more interesting according to their statistical significance and some simple considerations. The web interface is available at the address www.pesolelab.it by following the 'Tools' link. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.", "citationCount": 337, "authors": [{"name": "Pavesi G."}, {"name": "Mereghetti P."}, {"name": "Mauri G."}, {"name": "Pesole G."}], "date": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Giulio Pavesi", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "giulio.pavesi@unimi.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:web_weeder", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://159.149.160.51/modtools/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "DNA transcription", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0372"}, {"term": "Transcription factor binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0445"}, {"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Server which identifies conserved motifs within sets of related regulatory DNA sequences, which are likely to be transcription factor binding sites.
