To achieve this goal, we designed a set of tools under the Galaxy framework to allow biologists to define their own strategy for reproducible biomarker selection. These tools rely on retrieving experimental data from public databases, and applying successive filters derived from information relating to disease pathophysiology. A step-by-step protocol linking these tools was implemented to select tissue-leakage biomarker candidates of myocardial infarction. A list of 24 candidates suitable for experimental assessment by MS-based proteomics is proposed. These tools have been made publicly available at http://www.proteore.org, allowing researchers to reuse them in their quest for biomarker discovery.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Nguyen L."}, {"name": "Brun V."}, {"name": "Combes F."}, {"name": "Loux V."}, {"name": "Vandenbrouck Y."}], "date": "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": [], "name": "Yves Vandenbrouck", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1292-373X", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yves.vandenbrouck@cea.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ProteoRE", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": ["France"], "version": ["2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.proteore.org/", "function": [], "lastUpdate": "2019-09-04T06:48:48Z", "otherID": [], "description": "ProteoRE (Proteomics Research Environment) is a Galaxy-based instance for the functional analysis and the exploration of proteomics and transcriptomics data in biomedical research;  ProteoRE comprises 18 tools organized into five subsections for: i) data manipulation; ii) human and iii ) mouse species database annotation; iv) functional analysis; and v) pathway analysis along with graphical representations.", "toolType": ["Web application", "Workflow"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/ifb-git/ProteoRE", "note": "All ProteoRE's tools are publicly developped on GitHub", "type": "Repository"}, {"url": "https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/proteore", "note": "These tools can be installed on any Galaxy instance through the Galaxy ToolShed", "type": "Repository"}, {"url": "https://galaxyproject.github.io/training-material/topics/proteomics", "note": "Tutorials available on the Galaxy Training Network", "type": "Other"}], "biotoolsID": "ProteoRE", "additionDate": "2019-09-03T14:47:34Z", "name": "ProteoRE", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
