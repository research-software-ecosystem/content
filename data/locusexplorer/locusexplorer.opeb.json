Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: In this article, we present LocusExplorer, a data visualization and exploration tool for genetic association data. LocusExplorer is written in R using the Shiny library, providing access to powerful R-based functions through a simple user interface. LocusExplorer allows users to simultaneously display genetic, statistical and biological data for humans in a single image and allows dynamic zooming and customization of the plot features. Publication quality plots may then be produced in a variety of file formats. Availability and implementation: LocusExplorer is open source and runs through R and a web browser. It is available at www.oncogenetics.icr.ac.uk/LocusExplorer/ or can be installed locally and the source code accessed from https://github.com/oncogenetics/LocusExplorer.
