description: User-friendly package designed for unix-like systems and largely automates
  the analyses related to whole genome re-sequencing. it is compatible with a full
  range of sequence data and performs a series of user-defined analyses, including
  read trimming, collapsing of overlapping mate-pairs, read mapping, pcr duplicate
  removal, snp calling, and metagenomic profiling.
