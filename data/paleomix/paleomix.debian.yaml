summary: pipelines and tools for the processing of ancient and modern HTS data
description: >
   The PALEOMIX pipelines are a set of pipelines and tools designed to aid
   the rapid processing of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data: The BAM
   pipeline processes de-multiplexed reads from one or more samples,
   through sequence processing and alignment, to generate BAM alignment
   files useful in downstream analyses; the Phylogenetic pipeline carries
   out genotyping and phylogenetic inference on BAM alignment files, either
   produced using the BAM pipeline or generated elsewhere; and the Zonkey
   pipeline carries out a suite of analyses on low coverage equine
   alignments, in order to detect the presence of F1-hybrids in
   archaeological assemblages. In addition, PALEOMIX aids in metagenomic
   analysis of the extracts.
   .
   The pipelines have been designed with ancient DNA (aDNA) in mind, and
   includes several features especially useful for the analyses of ancient
   samples, but can all be for the processing of modern samples, in order
   to ensure consistent data processing.
