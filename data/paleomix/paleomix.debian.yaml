description: 'The PALEOMIX pipelines are a set of pipelines and tools designed to
  aid the rapid processing of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) data: The BAM pipeline
  processes de-multiplexed reads from one or more samples, through sequence processing
  and alignment, to generate BAM alignment files useful in downstream analyses; the
  Phylogenetic pipeline carries out genotyping and phylogenetic inference on BAM alignment
  files, either produced using the BAM pipeline or generated elsewhere; and the Zonkey
  pipeline carries out a suite of analyses on low coverage equine alignments, in order
  to detect the presence of F1-hybrids in archaeological assemblages. In addition,
  PALEOMIX aids in metagenomic analysis of the extracts. . The pipelines have been
  designed with ancient DNA (aDNA) in mind, and includes several features especially
  useful for the analyses of ancient samples, but can all be for the processing of
  modern samples, in order to ensure consistent data processing.'
