    "description": "Software for the de novo interpretation of peptide CID spectra.High quality tandem mass spectra of peptides are often obtained for which no exact database match can be made. Consequently, we are faced with the question of whether the protein under investigation is novel, or if the non-matching spectra are due to less exciting prospects such as inter-species variation, database sequence errors, or unexpected proteolytic cleavages.",

                "abstract": "There are many computer programs that can match tandem mass spectra of peptides to database-derived sequences; however, situations can arise where mass spectral data cannot be correlated with any database sequence. In such cases, sequences can be automatically deduced de novo, without recourse to sequence databases, and the resulting peptide sequences can be used to perform homologous nonexact searches of sequence databases. This article describes details on how to implement both a de novo sequencing program called \"Lutefisk,\" and a version of FASTA that has been modified to account for sequence ambiguities inherent in tandem mass spectrometry data.",
