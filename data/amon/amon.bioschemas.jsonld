The environment can be created by first downloading the environment file.\n\nA command line tool for predicting the compounds produced by microbes and the host.\n\nAMON includes two scripts. extract_ko_genome_from_organism.py takes a KEGG organism flat file and makes a list of KOs present in that file. AMON.py predicts the metabolites that could be produced by the KOs used as input. This can be compared to the KOs present in the host or from some other gene set as well as to as set of KEGG metabolites",
