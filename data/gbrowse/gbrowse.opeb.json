The Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) is an open-source browser developed as part of the Generic Model Organism Database project (Stein et al., 2002). GBrowse can be configured to display genomic sequence features for any organism and is the browser used for the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster (Grumbling and Strelets, 2006) and Caenorhabditis elegans (Schwarz et al., 2006), among others. The software package can be downloaded from the web and run on a Windows, Mac OS X, or Unix-type system. Version 1.64, as described in this protocol, was released in November 2005, but the software is under active development and new versions are released about every six months.",
