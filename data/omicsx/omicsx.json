    "description": "a web server for integrated OMICS analysis | OmicsX is a user-friendly web server for integration and comparison of different omic datasets with optional sample annotation information. The tool includes four modules for gene-wise correlation, sample-wise correlation, subtype clustering, and differential expression. OmicsX provides researchers the analysis results including inter-omics correlations, conservative clusters, differential expressions, enriched biological pathways and associated phenotypes with visualization, searching, and data downloading, thus help to suggest the biological indications from the comparison of different omic data",
