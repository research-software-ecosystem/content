Protein colocalisation is often studied using pixel intensity-based coefficients such as Pearson, Manders, Li or Costes. However, these methods cannot be used to study object-based colocalisations in biological systems. Therefore, a novel method is required to automatically identify regions of fluorescent signal in two channels, identify the co-located parts of these regions, and calculate the statistical significance of the colocalisation. We have developed MatCol to address these needs. MatCol can be used to visualise protein and/or DNA colocalisations and fine tune user-defined parameters for the colocalisation analysis, including the application of median or Wiener filtering to improve the signal to noise ratio. Command-line execution allows batch processing of multiple images. Users can also calculate the statistical significance of the observed object colocalisations compared to overlap by random chance using Student's t-test. We validated MatCol in a biological setting. The colocalisations of telomeric DNA and TRF2 protein or TRF2 and PML proteins in >350 nuclei derived from three different cell lines revealed a highly significant correlation between manual and MatCol identification of colocalisations (linear regression R2 = 0.81, P < 0.0001). MatCol has the ability to replace manual colocalisation counting, and the potential to be applied to a wide range of biological areas.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Khushi M."}, {"name": "Napier C.E."}, {"name": "Smyth C.M."}, {"name": "Reddel R.R."}, {"name": "Arthur J.W."}], "date": "2017-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Scientific Reports"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "info@cmri.org.au"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:matcol", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.cmri.org.au/bioinformatics.htm", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Image analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Measure fluorescence signal colocalisation in biological systems.", "toolType": ["Script"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["MATLAB"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "matcol", "additionDate": "2018-07-09T16:09:25Z", "name": "MatCol", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
