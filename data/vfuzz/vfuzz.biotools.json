    "description": "Vulnerability Prediction-Assisted Evolutionary Fuzzing for Binary Programs.\n\nFuzzing is a technique of finding bugs by executing a target program recurrently with a large number of abnormal inputs. Most of the coverage-based fuzzers consider all parts of a program equally and pay too much attention to how to improve the code coverage. It is inefficient as the vulnerable code only takes a tiny fraction of the entire code. In this article, we design and implement an evolutionary fuzzing framework called V-Fuzz, which aims to find bugs efficiently and quickly in limited time for binary programs. V-Fuzz consists of two main components: 1) a vulnerability prediction model and 2) a vulnerability-oriented evolutionary fuzzer. Given a binary program to V-Fuzz, the vulnerability prediction model will give a prior estimation on which parts of a program are more likely to be vulnerable",
