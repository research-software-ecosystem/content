As the most complex biological group, algae have shown the high diversity during the long evolutionary history. Algae are widely distributed in 4 kingdoms of the Eukaryota, including the Plantae, Protozoa, Acritarcha, Chromista and Fungi. Up to now, there are 46,177 species of eukaryotic algae have been recognized and classified (AlgaeBase, 2020), but in fact, more species need the further confirmation.",
