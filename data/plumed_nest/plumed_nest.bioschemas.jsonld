It provides all the data needed to reproduce the results of a PLUMED-enhanced molecular dynamics simulation (or analysis) contained in a published paper. Furthermore, PLUMED-NEST monitors the compatibility of the provided PLUMED input files with the current and development versions of the code and integrates links from these files to the PLUMED manual | The community-developed PLUgin for MolEcular Dynamics | PLUMED is an open-source, community-developed library that provides a wide range of different methods, which include: | Home News People Download Doc Forum Cite NEST Funding",
