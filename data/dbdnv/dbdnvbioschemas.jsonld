  "sc:description": "The duplicated gene nucleotide variants database (dbDNV) (http://goods.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/DNVs/) promotes accurate variation annotation. Aside from the flat file download, users can explore the gene-related duplications and the associated DNVs by DGL and DNV searches, respectively. In addition, the dbDNV contains 304,110 DNV-coupled SNPs. From DNV-coupled SNP search, users observe which SNP records are also variants among duplicates.",
