As a variant of RNN, long short term memory(LSTM) solved the problem in some extent. Here we improved LSTM for big data application in protein-protein interaction interface residue pairs prediction based on the following two reasons. On the one hand, there are some deficiencies in LSTM, such as shallow layers, gradient explosion or vanishing, etc. With a dramatic data increasing, the imbalance between algorithm innovation and big data processing has been more serious and urgent.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'LSTM' (bio.tools/LSTM)","homepage":"https://github.com/Jiale-Liu/LSTM","name":"memory(LSTM"}}
