Unfortunately, ongoing research is often confined by the irreproducibility of the results in other contexts. While the inconsistency of pharmacological data has received great attention recently, the computational aspect of this crisis still deserves closer examination. Notably, studies often focus only on isolated model characteristics instead of examining the overall workflow and the interplay of individual model components. Here, we present a systematic investigation of translational models using the R-package FORESEE","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/731836","name":"non-transferability"}}
