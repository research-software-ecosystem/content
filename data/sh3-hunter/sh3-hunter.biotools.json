                "abstract": "Motivation: Unravelling the rules underlying protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions is a crucial step in understanding cell machinery. Peptide recognition modules (PRMs) are globular protein domains which focus their binding targets on short protein sequences and play a key role in the frame of protein-protein interactions. High-throughput techniques permit the whole proteome scanning of each domain, but they are characterized by a high incidence of false positives. In this context, there is a pressing need for the development of in silico experiments to validate experimental results and of computational tools for the inference of domain-peptide interactions. Results: We focused on the SH3 domain family and developed a machine-learning approach for inferring interaction specificity. SH3 domains are well-studied PRMs which typically bind proline-rich short sequences characterized by the PxxP consensus. The binding information is known to be held in the conformation of the domain surface and in the short sequence of the peptide. Our method relies on interaction data from high-throughput techniques and benefits from the integration of sequence and structure data of the interacting partners. Here, we propose a novel encoding technique aimed at representing binding information on the basis of the domain-peptide contact residues in complexes of known structure. Remarkably, the new encoding requires few variables to represent an interaction, thus avoiding the 'curse of dimension'. Our results display an accuracy >90% in detecting new binders of known SH3 domains, thus outperforming neural models on standard binary encodings, profile methods and recent statistical predictors. The method, moreover, shows a generalization capability, inferring specificity of unknown SH3 domains displaying some degree of similarity with the known data. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",

                "abstract": "SH3-Hunter (http://cbm.bio.uniroma2.it/SH3-Hunter/) is a web server for the recognition of putative SH3 domain interaction sites on protein sequences. Given an input query consisting of one or more protein sequences, the server identifies peptides containing poly-proline binding motifs and associates them to a list of SH3 domains, in order to compose peptide-domain pairs. The server can accept a list of peptides and allows users to upload an input file in a proper format. An accurate selection of SH3 domains is available and users can also submit their own SH3 domain sequence. SH3-Hunter evaluates which peptide-domain pair represents a possible interaction pair and produces as output a list of significant interaction sites for each query protein. Each proposed interaction site is associated to a propensity score and sensitivity and precision levels for the prediction. The server prediction capability is based on a neural network model integrating high-throughput pep-spot data with structural information extracted from known SH3-peptide complexes. © 2007 The Author(s).",

                "abstract": "We have developed a procedure to predict the peptide binding specificity of an SH3 domain from its sequence. The procedure utilizes information extracted from position-specific contacts derived from six SH3/peptide or SH3/protein complexes of known structure. The framework of SH3/peptide contacts defined on the structure of the complexes is used to build a residue-residue interaction database derived from ligands obtained by panning peptide libraries displayed on filamentous phage. The SH3-specific interaction database is a multidimensional array containing frequencies of position-specific contacts. As input, SH3-SPOT requires the sequence of an SH3 domain and of a query decapeptide ligand. The array, that we call the SH3-specific matrix, is then used to evaluate the probability that the peptide would bind the given SH3 domain. This procedure is fast enough to be applied to the entire protein sequence database. Panning experiments were performed to search putative specific ligands of different SH3 domains in a database of decapeptides, or in a database of protein sequences. The procedure ranked some of the natural partners of interaction of a number of SH3 domains among the best ligands of the ~5.6 x 109 different decapeptides in the SWISSPROT database. We expect the predictive power of the method to increase with the enrichment of the SH3-specific matrix by interaction data derived from new complex structures or from the characterization of new ligands. The procedure was developed using the SH3 domain family as test case but its application can easily be extended to other families of protein domains (such as, SH2, MHC, EH, PDZ, etc.).
