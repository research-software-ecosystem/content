Other challenges are the development of faster and more efficient sampling methods and the introduction of receptor and ligand flexibility during simulations. Overall, good discrimination of near-native docking poses from the very early stages of rigid-body protein docking is essential step before applying more costly interface refinement to the correct docking solutions. Here we explore a simple approach to scoring of rigid-body docking poses, which has been implemented in a program called pyDock. The scheme is based on Coulombic electrostatics with distance dependent dielectric constant, and implicit desolvation energy with atomic solvation parameters previously adjusted for rigid-body protein-protein docking. This scoring function is not highly dependent on specific geometry of the docking poses and therefore can be used in rigid-body docking sets generated by a variety of methods. We have tested the procedure in a large benchmark set of 80 unbound docking cases. The method is able to detect a near-native solution from 12,000 docking poses and place it within the 100 lowest-energy docking solutions in 56% of the cases, in a completely unrestricted manner and without any other additional information. More specifically, a near-native solution will lie within the top 20 solutions in 37% of the cases. The simplicity of the approach allows for a better understanding of the physical principles behind protein-protein association, and provides a fast tool for the evaluation of large sets of rigid-body docking poses in search of the near-native orientation. \u00a9 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 165, "authors": [{"name": "Cheng T.M.-K."}, {"name": "Blundell T.L."}, {"name": "Fernandez-Recio J."}], "date": "2007-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://life.bsc.es/pid/pydock/get_pydock.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "juanf@bsc.es"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pydock", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://life.bsc.es/pid/pydock/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Protein complex", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2877"}, "format": [{"term": "PDB", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1476"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein complex", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2877"}, "format": [{"term": "PDB", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1476"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "pyDock is a fast protocol for protein-protein docking which uses electrostatics and desolvation energy to score docking poses generated with FFT-based algorithms.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "pydock", "additionDate": "2017-11-14T10:09:20Z", "name": "pyDock", "license": "Proprietary", "documentation": [{"url": "https://life.bsc.es/pid/pydock/doc/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
