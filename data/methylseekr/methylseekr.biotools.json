Here, we present MethylSeekR, a computational tool to accurately identify such footprints from bisulfite-sequencing data. Applying our method to a large number of published human methylomes, we demonstrate its broad applicability and generalize our previous findings from a neuronal differentiation system to many cell types and tissues. MethylSeekR is available as an R package at www.bioconductor.org. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s).",
