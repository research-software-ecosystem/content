We performed ultra-deep pyrosequencing to detect minor sequence variants in HIV-1 protease and reverse transcriptase (RT) genes from clinical plasma samples. We estimated empirical error rates from four HIV-1 plasmid clones and used them to develop a statistical approach to distinguish authentic minor variants from sequencing errors in eight clinical samples. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing detected an average of 58 variants per sample compared with an average of eight variants per sample detected by conventional direct-PCR dideoxynucleotide sequencing. In the clinical sample with the largest number of minor sequence variants, all 60 variants present in \u22653% of genomes and 20 of 35 variants present in <3% of genomes were confirmed by limiting dilution sequencing. With appropriate analysis, ultra-deep pyrosequencing is a promising method for characterizing genetic diversity and detecting minor yet clinically relevant variants in biological samples with complex genetic populations. \u00a92007 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 319, "authors": [{"name": "Wang C."}, {"name": "Mitsuya Y."}, {"name": "Gharizadeh B."}, {"name": "Ronaghi M."}, {"name": "Shafer R.W."}], "date": "2007-08-09T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "HIV db support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hivdbteam@stanford.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pyromap", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/resources.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "PyroMap accurately maps pyrosequencing reads onto reference sequences using a selectively weighted Smith-Waterman (SW^2) algorithm to incorporate quality scores into alignment.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "pyromap", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:15:58Z", "name": "PyroMap", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://hivdb.stanford.edu/pages/resources.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
