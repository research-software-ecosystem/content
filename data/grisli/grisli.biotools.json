All rights reserved.Motivation Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers new possibilities to infer gene regulatory network (GRNs) for biological processes involving a notion of time, such as cell differentiation or cell cycles. It also raises many challenges due to the destructive measurements inherent to the technology. Results: In this work, we propose a new method named GRISLI for de novo GRN inference from scRNA-seq data. GRISLI infers a velocity vector field in the space of scRNA-seq data from profiles of individual cells, and models the dynamics of cell trajectories with a linear ordinary differential equation to reconstruct the underlying GRN with a sparse regression procedure. We show on real data that GRISLI outperforms a recently proposed state-of-The-Art method for GRN reconstruction from scRNA-seq data.",
