To date, cloning has identified over 200 miRNAs from diverse eukaryotic organisms. Despite their success, such biochemical approaches are skewed toward identifying abundant miRNAs, unlike genome-wide, sequence-based computational predictions. We developed informatic methods to predict miRNAs in the C. elegans genome using sequence conservation and structural similarity to known miRNAs and generated 214 candidates. We confirmed the expression of four new miRNAs by Northern blotting and used a more sensitive PCR approach to verify the expression of ten additional candidates. Based on hypotheses underlying our computational methods, we estimate that the C. elegans genome may encode between 140 and 300 miRNAs and potentially many more.","authors":["Grad Y.","Aach J.","Hayes G.D.","Reinhart B.J.","Church G.M.","Ruvkun G.","Kim J."],"cit_count":223,"journal":"Molecular Cell","pmid":"12769849","title":"Computational and experimental identification of C. elegans microRNAs","year":"2003-05-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:srnaloop","biotoolsID":"srnaloop","description":"The tool searches long DNA/RNA strings for small RNA hairpin loops that may be candidates for small RNA regulatory sequences.","homepage":"http://arep.med.harvard.edu/miRNA/","name":"srnaloop"}}
