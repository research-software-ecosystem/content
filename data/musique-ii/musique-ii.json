    "description": "Learning No-Reference Quality Assessment of Multiply and Singly Distorted Images with Big Data.\n\nPrevious research on no-reference (NR) quality assessment of multiply-distorted images focused mainly on three distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, and JPEG compression), while in practice images can be contaminated by many other common distortions due to the various stages of processing. Although MUSIQUE (MUltiply-and Singly-distorted Image QUality Estimator) Zhang et al., TIP 2018 is a successful NR algorithm, this approach is still limited to the three distortion types. In this paper, we extend MUSIQUE to MUSIQUE-II to blindly assess the quality of images corrupted by five distortion types (white noise, Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, JPEG2000 compression, and contrast change) and their combinations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
