    "description": "an integrated method for in-depth and comprehensive N-glycoproteome profiling of human plasma.\n\nN-glycoproteins are involved in various biological processes. Certain distinctive glycoforms on specific glycoproteins enhance the specificity and or sensitivity of cancer diagnosis. Therefore, the characterization of plasma N-glycoproteome is essential for new biomarker discovery. Absence of suitable analytical methods for in-depth and large-scale analyses of low-abundance plasma glycoproteins make it challenging to investigate the role of glycosylation. In this study, we developed an integrated method termed Glyco-CPLL, which integrates combinatorial peptide ligand libraries, high-pH reversed-phase pre-fractionation, hydrophilic interaction chromatography, trypsin and PNGase F digestion, shotgun proteomics, and various analysis software (MaxQuant and pGlyco2.0) for the low-abundance plasma glycoproteomic profiling.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
