This method is capable of revealing the similar magnitude of global changes as the spike-in method | Traditional reads per million (RPM) normalization method is inappropriate for the evaluation of ChIP-seq data when the treatment or mutation has the global effect","homepage":"https://github.com/stjude/ChIPseqSpikeInFree","name":"ChIPseqSpikeInFree"}}
