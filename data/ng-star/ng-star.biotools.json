We defined N. gonorrhoeae Sequence Typing for Antimicrobial Resistance (NG-STAR) clonal complexes (CCs) and validated their usefulness in gonococcal AMR surveillance. METHODS: All NG-STAR alleles and STs available in the public database (https://ngstar.canada.ca/) were analysed using PHYLOViZ 2.0 to define CCs according to the closest founder ST with \u22655 identical alleles and founding ST with the highest number of links. The published 2013 European gonococcal dataset (n = 1054), the 2016 WHO reference strain panel (n = 14) and N. gonorrhoeae isolates with ceftriaxone resistance determinant penA-60.001 (n = 7) from several countries were used for validation. RESULTS: The majority of the isolates (n = 1063) were designated to 71 CCs. The most common CC was CC90 (n = 194), followed by CC63 (n = 166), CC139 (n = 73), CC158 (n = 73) and CC127 (n = 62). CC90 included isolates belonging to the internationally spread MDR clone N. gonorrhoeae Multi-Antigen Sequence Typing (NG-MAST) G1407 (predominantly MLST ST1901). The ceftriaxone-resistant isolates with penA-60.001 (n = 7) belonged to CC73 or STs linking between CC90 and CC73 (ST233 and ST1133). Phylogenomic analysis revealed that NG-STAR CCs more appropriately correlated to phylogenomic AMR clusters compared with MLST STs, NG-MAST STs, NG-MAST genogroups and NG-STAR STs. CONCLUSIONS: NG-STAR CCs: are consistent with the gonococcal genome phylogeny; allow rapid visualizations with limited computational requirements; provide a simple, reproducible and portable nomenclature (for WGS and conventional Sanger sequencing data); and predict AMR lineages. Phenotypic AMR surveillance, supplemented with WGS, is imperative and NG-STAR CCs can effectively support this.",
