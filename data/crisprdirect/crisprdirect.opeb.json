The CRISPR/Cas system is a promising technique for genome engineering which allows target-specific cleavage of genomic DNA guided by Cas9 nuclease in complex with a guide RNA (gRNA), that complementarily binds to a ∼20 nt targeted sequence. The target sequence requirements are twofold. First, the 5′-NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence must be located adjacent to the target sequence. Second, the target sequence should be specific within the entire genome in order to avoid off-target editing. CRISPRdirect enables users to easily select rational target sequences with minimized off-target sites by performing exhaustive searches against genomic sequences. The server currently incorporates the genomic sequences of human, mouse, rat, marmoset, pig, chicken, frog, zebrafish, Ciona, fruit fly, silkworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis, rice, Sorghum and budding yeast.","authors":["Naito Y.","Hino K.","Bono H.","Ui-Tei K."],"cit_count":224,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu743","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"CRISPRdirect: Software for designing CRISPR/Cas guide RNA with reduced off-target sites","type":"Primary","year":"2015-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CRISPRdirect","biotoolsID":"CRISPRdirect","description":"Software for designing CRISPR/Cas guide RNA with reduced off-target sites.","homepage":"http://crispr.dbcls.jp/","name":"CRISPRdirect"}}
