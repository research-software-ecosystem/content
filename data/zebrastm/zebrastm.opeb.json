Recently, the evaluation of spontaneous tail movement (STM) in zebrafish embryos has been proposed as a possible neurotoxicity marker in studies on behavioral changes due to chemical exposure. Currently, automated STM quantification can only be performed using high-cost commercial software. We have developed a simple and reliable MATLAB ® script called ZebraSTM that allows the automatic analysis of STM in multiple zebrafish embryos.","authors":["Gonzalez-Fraga J.","Dipp-Alvarez V.","Bardullas U."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1089/zeb.2018.1688","journal":"Zebrafish","pmid":"30615594","title":"Quantification of Spontaneous Tail Movement in Zebrafish Embryos Using a Novel Open-Source MATLAB Application","type":"Primary","year":"2019-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ZebraSTM","biotoolsID":"ZebraSTM","description":"Application for quantification of spontaneous tail movement in zebrafish embryos.","homepage":"http://lcc.ens.uabc.mx/~zebrastm/","name":"ZebraSTM"}}
