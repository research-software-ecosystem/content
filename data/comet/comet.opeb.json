Thus the database search engine is an integral tool in many proteomics research groups. Here, we introduce the Comet search engine to the existing landscape of commercial and open-source database search tools. Comet is open source, freely available, and based on one of the original sequence database search tools that has been widely used for many years. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Comet database search software was initially released as an open source project in late 2012. Prior to that, Comet existed as the University of Washington's academic version of the SEQUEST database search tool. Despite its availability and widespread use over the years, some details about its implementation have not been previously disseminated or are not well understood. We address a few of these details in depth and highlight new features available in the latest release.
