In recent years, various versions of the program have been developed, some of which are fully automated, whereas others are able to accept user-specified external information. In this article, we review some versions of the program that are available through 'Göttingen Bioinformatics Compute Server'. In addition to previously described implementations, we present a new release of DIALIGN called 'DIALIGN-PFAM', which uses hits to the PFAM database for improved protein alignment. Our software is available through http://dialign.gobics.de/.","authors":["Al Ait L.","Yamak Z.","Morgenstern B."],"cit_count":20,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23620293","title":"DIALIGN at GOBICS--multiple sequence alignment using various sources of external information.","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dialign","biotoolsID":"dialign","description":"Multiple alignment program which assembles a global sequence alignment from gap-free local pairwise alignments.
