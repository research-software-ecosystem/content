The software extends a well-studied and widely-applied algorithm, the time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (TSIR) model, to infer parameters from incidence data, such as contact seasonality, and to forward simulate the underlying mechanistic model. The tsiR package aggregates a number of different fitting features previously described in the literature in a user-friendly way, providing support for their broader adoption in infectious disease research. Also included in tsiR are a number of diagnostic tools to assess the fit of the TSIR model. This package should be useful for researchers analyzing incidence data for fully-immunizing infectious diseases.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Becker A.D."}, {"name": "Grenfell B.T."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PloS one"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Alexander D.
