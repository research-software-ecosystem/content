It offers an object-oriented programming class library, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and automatic MATLAB code generation. The class library contains a large number of methods, concepts and visualizations for VBS data analysis, some of which are introduced in the toolbox. The GUIs provide an interface to the class library, including a module to merge several spectral files into a dataset. Automatic code allows developers to quickly write VBS data analysis scripts and is a unique resource among tools for VBS. Documentation includes a manual, tutorials, Doxygen-generated reference and a demonstration showcase. IRootLab can handle some of the most popular file formats used in VBS. © 2013 The Author.","authors":["Trevisan J.","Angelov P.P.","Scott A.D.","Carmichael P.L.","Martin F.L."],"cit_count":64,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"23422340","title":"IRootLab: A free and open-source MATLAB toolbox for vibrational biospectroscopy data analysis","year":"2013-04-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:irootlab","biotoolsID":"irootlab","description":"Open-source project dedicated to providing a MATLAB framework for vibrational spectroscopy.
