Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","authors":["Subramanian A.","Tamayo P.","Mootha V.K.","Mukherjee S.","Ebert B.L.","Gillette M.A.","Paulovich A.","Pomeroy S.L.","Golub T.R.","Lander E.S.","Mesirov J.P."],"cit_count":11962,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0506580102","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","title":"Gene set enrichment analysis: A knowledge-based approach for interpreting genome-wide expression profiles","year":"2005-10-25"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gsea","biotoolsID":"gsea","description":"Computational method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences between two biological states (e.g. phenotypes).","homepage":"http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp","name":"GSEA"}}
