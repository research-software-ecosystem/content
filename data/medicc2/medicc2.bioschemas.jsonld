      "sc:description": "Whole-genome doubling-aware copy number phylogenies for cancer evolution with MEDICC2. Chromosomal instability (CIN) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) play a key role in the evolutionary process that shapes cancer genomes. SCNAs comprise many classes of clinically relevant events, such as localised amplifications, gains, losses, loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) events, and recently discovered parallel evolutionary events revealed by multi-sample phasing. These events frequently appear jointly with whole genome doubling (WGD), a transformative event in tumour evolution, which generates tetraploid or near-tetraploid cells. WGD events are often clonal, occuring before the emergence of the most recent common ancestor, and have been associated with increased CIN, poor patient outcome and are currently being investigated as potential therapeutic targets",
