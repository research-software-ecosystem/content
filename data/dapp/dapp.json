    "description": "Building a Secure Biomedical Data Sharing Decentralized App (DApp).\n\nDecentralized apps (DApps) are computer programs that run on a distributed computing system, such as a blockchain network. Unlike the client-server architecture that powers most internet apps, DApps that are integrated with a blockchain network can execute app logic that is guaranteed to be transparent, verifiable, and immutable. This new paradigm has a number of unique properties that are attractive to the biomedical and health care communities. However, instructional resources are scarcely available for biomedical software developers to begin building DApps on a blockchain. Such apps require new ways of thinking about how to build, maintain, and deploy software. This tutorial serves as a complete working prototype of a DApp, motivated by a real use case in biomedical research requiring data privacy.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
