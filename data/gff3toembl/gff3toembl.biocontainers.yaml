description: Submitting annotated genomes to embl is a very difficult and time consuming
  process. this software converts gff3 files from the most commonly use prokaryote
  annotation tool prokka into a format that is suitable for submission to embl. it
  has been used to prepare more than 30% of all annotated genomes in embl/genbank.
