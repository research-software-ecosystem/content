                "abstract": "Background: Drug-disease associations provide important information for the drug discovery. Wet experiments that identify drug-disease associations are time-consuming and expensive. However, many drug-disease associations are still unobserved or unknown. The development of computational methods for predicting unobserved drug-disease associations is an important and urgent task. Results: In this paper, we proposed a similarity constrained matrix factorization method for the drug-disease association prediction (SCMFDD), which makes use of known drug-disease associations, drug features and disease semantic information. SCMFDD projects the drug-disease association relationship into two low-rank spaces, which uncover latent features for drugs and diseases, and then introduces drug feature-based similarities and disease semantic similarity as constraints for drugs and diseases in low-rank spaces. Different from the classic matrix factorization technique, SCMFDD takes the biological context of the problem into account. In computational experiments, the proposed method can produce high-accuracy performances on benchmark datasets, and outperform existing state-of-the-art prediction methods when evaluated by five-fold cross validation and independent testing. Conclusion: We developed a user-friendly web server by using known associations collected from the CTD database, available at http://www.bioinfotech.cn/SCMFDD/. The case studies show that the server can find out novel associations, which are not included in the CTD database.",
