Background: Drug-disease associations provide important information for the drug discovery. Wet experiments that identify drug-disease associations are time-consuming and expensive. However, many drug-disease associations are still unobserved or unknown. The development of computational methods for predicting unobserved drug-disease associations is an important and urgent task. Results: In this paper, we proposed a similarity constrained matrix factorization method for the drug-disease association prediction (SCMFDD), which makes use of known drug-disease associations, drug features and disease semantic information. SCMFDD projects the drug-disease association relationship into two low-rank spaces, which uncover latent features for drugs and diseases, and then introduces drug feature-based similarities and disease semantic similarity as constraints for drugs and diseases in low-rank spaces. Different from the classic matrix factorization technique, SCMFDD takes the biological context of the problem into account. In computational experiments, the proposed method can produce high-accuracy performances on benchmark datasets, and outperform existing state-of-the-art prediction methods when evaluated by five-fold cross validation and independent testing. Conclusion: We developed a user-friendly web server by using known associations collected from the CTD database, available at http://www.bioinfotech.cn/SCMFDD/. The case studies show that the server can find out novel associations, which are not included in the CTD database.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Zhang W."}, {"name": "Yue X."}, {"name": "Lin W."}, {"name": "Wu W."}, {"name": "Liu R."}, {"name": "Huang F."}, {"name": "Liu F."}], "date": "2018-06-19T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Wen Zhang", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "zhangwen@whu.edu.cn"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Feng Liu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "fliuwhu@whu.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:scmfdd", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bioinfotech.cn/SCMFDD/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Data handling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Similarity constrained matrix factorization method for the drug-disease association prediction, which makes use of known drug-disease associations, drug features and disease semantic information.
