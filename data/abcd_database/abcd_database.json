    "description": "a repository for chemically defined antibodies | ABCD (AntiBodies Chemically Defined) | The ABCD (AntiBodies Chemically Defined) Database | The ABCD (AntiBodies Chemically Defined) database is a manually curated depository of sequenced antibodies, developed by the Geneva Antibody Facility at the University of Geneva, in collaboration with the CALIPHO and Swiss-Prot groups at SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics | Search by antibody name, species or target (UniProt or ChEBI ID) | The ABCD database is part of a broader project, with the mission of promoting the widespread use of recombinant antibodies by academic researchers and, ultimately, the replacement of animal-produced antibodies. This concerted effort also includes the Geneva Antibody Facility (for discovery and production of antibodies) and the scientific journal Antibody Reports (publishing technical articles on antibody characterization)",
