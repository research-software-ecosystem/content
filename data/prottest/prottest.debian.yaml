description: 'PROTTEST (ModelTest''s relative) is a program for selecting the model
  of protein evolution that best fits a given set of sequences (alignment). This java
  program is based on the Phyml program (for maximum likelihood calculations and optimization
  of parameters) and uses the PAL library as well. Models included are empirical substitution
  matrices (such as WAG, LG, mtREV, Dayhoff, DCMut, JTT, VT, Blosum62, CpREV, RtREV,
  MtMam, MtArt, HIVb, and HIVw) that indicate relative rates of amino acid replacement,
  and specific improvements (+I:invariable sites, +G: rate heterogeneity among sites,
  +F: observed amino acid frequencies) to account for the evolutionary constraints
  impossed by conservation of protein structure and function. ProtTest uses the Akaike
  Information Criterion (AIC) and other statistics (AICc and BIC) to find which of
  the candidate models best fits the data at hand.'
