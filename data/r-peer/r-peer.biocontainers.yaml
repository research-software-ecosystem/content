description: 'PEER is a collection of Bayesian approaches to infer hidden determinants
  and their effects from gene expression profiles using factor analysis methods. Applications
  of PEER have (i) detected batch effects and experimental confounders (ii) increased
  the number of expression QTL findings by threefold and (iii) allowed inference of
  intermediate cellular traits, such as transcription factor or pathway activations.
  This project offers an efficient and versatile C++ implementation of the underlying
  algorithms with user-friendly interfaces to R and python. '
