    "description": "An exploratory study of the state of practice of performance testing in Java-based open source projects.\n\nThe usage of open source (OS) software is nowadays wide- spread across many industries and domains. While the functional quality of OS projects is considered to be up to par with that of closed-source software, much is unknown about the quality in terms of non-functional attributes, such as performance. One challenge for OS developers is that, unlike for functional testing, there is a lack of accepted best practices for performance testing. To reveal the state of practice of performance testing in OS projects, we conduct an exploratory study on 111 Java-based OS projects from GitHub.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'tooling', 'low-friction', 'non-parameterized', 'performance'",
