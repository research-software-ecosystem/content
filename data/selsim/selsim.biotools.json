SelSim allows simulation from either a fully stochastic model of, or deterministic approximations to, natural selection within a coalescent framework. A number of different mutation models are available for simulating surrounding neutral variation. The package enables a detailed exploration of the effects of different models and strengths of selection on patterns of diversity. This provides a tool for the statistical analysis of both empirical data and methods designed to detect natural selection. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
