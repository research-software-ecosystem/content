description: Mirtrace is a new quality control and taxonomic tracing tool developed
  specifically for small rna sequencing data (srna-seq). each sample is characterized
  by profiling sequencing quality, read length, sequencing depth and mirna complexity
  and also the \namounts of mirnas versus undesirable sequences (derived from trnas,
  rrnas and sequencing artifacts). in addition to these routine quality control (qc)
  analyses, mirtrace can accurately and sensitively resolve taxonomic origins of small
  rna-seq data based on the composition of clade-specific mirnas. this feature can
  be used to detect cross-clade contaminations in typical lab settings. it can also
  be applied for more specific applications in forensics, food quality control and
  clinical diagnosis, for instance tracing the origins of meat products or detecting
  parasitic micrornas in host serum.
