description: SNM is a modeling strategy especially designed for normalizing high-throughput
  genomic data. The underlying premise of our approach is that your data is a function
  of what we refer to as study-specific variables. These variables are either biological
  variables that represent the target of the statistical analysis, or adjustment variables
  that represent factors arising from the experimental or biological setting the data
  is drawn from. The SNM approach aims to simultaneously model all study-specific
  variables in order to more accurately characterize the biological or clinical variables
  of interest.
