description: Panphlan is a strain-level metagenomic profiling tool for identifying
  the gene composition and in-vivo transcriptional activity of individual strains
  in metagenomic samples. panphlan's ability for strain-tracking and functional analysis
  of unknown pathogens makes it an efficient tool for nculture-free infectious outbreak
  epidemiology and microbial population nstudies.
