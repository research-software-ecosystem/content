                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).The popularisation and decreased cost of genome resequencing has resulted in an increased use in molecular diagnostics. While there are a number of established and high quality bioinfomatic tools for identifying small genetic variants including single nucleotide variants and indels, currently there is no established standard for the detection of copy number variants (CNVs) from sequence data. The requirement for CNV detection from high throughput sequencing has resulted in the development of a large number of software packages. These tools typically utilise the sequence data characteristics: read depth, split reads, read pairs, and assembly-based techniques. However, the additional source of information from read balance (defined as relative proportion of reads of each allele at each position) has been underutilised in the existing applications. Here we present Read Balance Validator (RBV), a bioinformatic tool that uses read balance for prioritisation and validation of putative CNVs. The software simultaneously interrogates nominated regions for the presence of deletions or multiplications, and can differentiate larger CNVs from diploid regions. Additionally, the utility of RBV to test for inheritance of CNVs is demonstrated in this report. RBV is a CNV validation and prioritisation bioinformatic tool for both genome and exome sequencing available as a python package from https://github.com/whitneywhitford/RBV.",
