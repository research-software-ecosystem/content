Given the coordinates of a protein chain, the SALAMI server at www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/salami will search the protein data bank and return a set of similar structures without using sequence information. The results page lists the related proteins, details of the sequence and structure similarity and implied sequence alignments. Via a simple structure viewer, one can view superpositions of query and library structures and finally download superimposed coordinates. The alignment method is very tolerant of large gaps and insertions, and tends to produce slightly longer alignments than other similar programs.","authors":["Margraf T.","Schenk G.","Torda A.E."],"cit_count":19,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"19465380","title":"The SALAMI protein structure search server","year":"2009-08-04"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:salami","biotoolsID":"salami","description":"The SALAMI web server searches the protein data bank (PDB) for structures similar to input coordinates of a protein chain.
