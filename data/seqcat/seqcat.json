We have developed a novel analysis method that can interrogate the authenticity of biological samples used for generation of transcriptome profiles in public data repositories. The method uses RNA sequencing information to reveal mutations in expressed transcripts and subsequently confirms the identity of analysed cells by comparison with publicly available cell-specific mutational profiles. Cell lines constitute key model systems widely used within cancer research, but their identity needs to be confirmed in order to minimise the influence of cell contaminations and genetic drift on the analysis. Using both public and novel data, we demonstrate the use of RNA-sequencing data analysis for cell line authentication by examining the validity of COLO205, DLD1, HCT15, HCT116, HKE3, HT29 and RKO colorectal cancer cell lines. We successfully authenticate the studied cell lines and validate previous reports indicating that DLD1 and HCT15 are synonymous. We also show that the analysed HKE3 cells harbour an unexpected KRAS-G13D mutation and confirm that this cell line is a genuine KRAS dosage mutant, rather than a true isogenic derivative of HCT116 expressing only the wild type KRAS. This authentication method could be used to revisit the numerous cell line based RNA sequencing experiments available in public data repositories, analyse new experiments where whole genome sequencing is not available, as well as facilitate comparisons of data from different experiments, platforms and laboratories.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Fasterius E."}, {"name": "Raso C."}, {"name": "Kennedy S."}, {"name": "Rauch N."}, {"name": "Lundin P."}, {"name": "Kolch W."}, {"name": "Uhlen M."}, {"name": "Al-Khalili Szigyarto C."}], "date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Erik Fasterius", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "erikfas@kth.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:seqcat", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/seqCAT.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package uses variant calling data (in the form of VCF files) from high throughput sequencing technologies to authenticate and validate the source, function and characteristics of biological samples used in scientific endeavours.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/seqCAT/", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "seqcat", "additionDate": "2018-07-26T12:44:01Z", "name": "seqCAT", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/seqCAT/man/seqCAT.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
