        "description": "A Bayesian model to integrate changes in splicing and RNA binding protein activity.\n\nMOTIVATION:Alternative splicing (AS) is an important mechanism in the generation of transcript diversity across mammals. AS patterns are dynamically regulated during development and in response to environmental changes. Defects or perturbations in its regulation may lead to cancer or neurological disorders, among other pathological conditions. The regulatory mechanisms controlling AS in a given biological context are typically inferred using a two step-framework: differential AS analysis followed by enrichment methods. These strategies require setting rather arbitrary thresholds and are prone to error propagation along the analysis",
