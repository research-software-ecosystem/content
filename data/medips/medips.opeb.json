However, it provides functionalities for the analysis of any kind of quantitative sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) including calculation of differential coverage between groups of samples and saturation and correlation analysis.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MEDIPS.html","name":"MEDIPS","version":["1.24.0"]}}
