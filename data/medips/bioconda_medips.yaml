description: MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
  (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, MEDIPS provides
  functionalities for the analysis of any kind of quantitative sequencing data (e.g.
  ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) including calculation of differential coverage
  between groups of samples and saturation and correlation analysis.
