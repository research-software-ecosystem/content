Rohde et al. (2019) <doi:10.1101/503631>.\n\nThe qgg package was developed based on the hypothesis that certain regions on the genome, so-called genomic features, may be enriched for causal variants affecting the trait. Several genomic feature classes can be formed based on previous studies and different sources of information such as genes, chromosomes or biological pathways",
