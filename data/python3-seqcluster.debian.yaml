  description: analysis of small RNA in NGS data
  long_description: " Identifies small RNA sequences of all sorts in RNA sequencing\
    \ data. This is\n especially helpful for the identification of RNA that is neither\
    \ coding nor\n belonging to the already well-established group of miRNA, towards\
    \ many tools\n feel constrained to.\n .\n This package provides the Python module.\
    \ For executables see the package\n 'seqcluster'.\n"
