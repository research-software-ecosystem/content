For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.To face up to the exponential growth of heterogeneous datasets of various organisms, we developed a user-friendly platform for building multi-omics websites, which is named Bacnet. This platform helps bioinformaticians to construct four key web interfaces: (i) an interactive genome viewer; (ii) an expression and protein atlas; (iii) an interface for analysis of co-expression network; (iv) an interface for exploring homolog presence. We believe our platform will help the bioinformaticians to construct personalized user interfaces dedicated to biologists studying non-reference organisms.",
