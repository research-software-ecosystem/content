description: 'SPAdes (St. Petersburg genome assembler) is a genome assembly algorithm
  which was designed for

  single cell and multi-cells bacterial data sets. However, it might not be suitable
  for large

  genomes projects.


  SPAdes works with Ion Torrent, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, and Illumina paired-end,
  mate-pairs and

  single reads.
