The algorithm connects two or more groups with overlapping accession numbers. In some cases, pairwise groups are mutually exclusive but they may still be connected by another group with overlapping accession numbers. Thus, groups created by PGCA from multiple experimental runs are called \"connected\" groups.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pgca.html","name":"pgca","version":["1.4.0"]}}
