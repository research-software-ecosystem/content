The method identifies networks defined by three properties: first, member genes are recurrently altered via somatic mutation or copy number changes; second, member genes are likely to participate in the same biological pathway or process, as determined from prior pathway and network knowledge; and third, genomic events within the network exhibit a statistically significant level of mutual exclusivity.",

                "abstract": "Although individual tumors show surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient. While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in Cancer (MEMo). The method searches and identifies modules characterized by three properties: (1) member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually exclusive. MEMo integrates multiple data types and maps genomic alterations to biological pathways. MEMo's mutual exclusivity uses a statistical model that preserves the number of alterations per gene and per sample. \u00a9 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
