  "sc:description": "Method for identifying mutually exclusive driver networks in cancer. The method identifies networks defined by three properties: first, member genes are recurrently altered via somatic mutation or copy number changes; second, member genes are likely to participate in the same biological pathway or process, as determined from prior pathway and network knowledge; and third, genomic events within the network exhibit a statistically significant level of mutual exclusivity.",
