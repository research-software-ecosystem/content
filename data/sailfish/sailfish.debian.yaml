  description: RNA-seq expression estimation
  long_description: " RNA-seq is a technology to read at least parts of individual\
    \ RNA\n sequences of a tissue sample. After assigning these reads to genes\n that\
    \ are likely responsible to have coded for them (mapping), this\n gives an insight\
    \ (estimate) about how much these genes have been\n active (expressed) in that\
    \ sample. The trickier bits in that process\n to address is the similarity of\
    \ genes and the genes being capable to\n variably but deterministically skip parts\
    \ of their sequence to be read\n (introns). A single variantly spliced gene may\
    \ then yield different\n sequences (isoforms) and the RNA-seq evaluation better\
    \ informs about\n this. It may be relevant for a disease.\n .\n Sailfish is particularly\
    \ good (efficient) in this process. It tricks\n the complexity by introducing\
    \ an intermediate level of artificial very\n short reads to which the alternative\
    \ splicing is of no concern. That\n can then be addressed by \"telephone-book\"\
    -like hashing techniques that\n are easy and lightning fast. The final presentation\
    \ is then found to\n be competitive with established mappers like eXpress and\
    \ Cufflinks."
