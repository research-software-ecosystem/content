  description: RNA-seq expression estimation
  long_description: " RNA-seq is a technology to read at least parts of individual
    RNA\n sequences of a tissue sample. After assigning these reads to genes\n that
    are likely responsible to have coded for them (mapping), this\n gives an insight
    (estimate) about how much these genes have been\n active (expressed) in that sample.
    The trickier bits in that process\n to address is the similarity of genes and
    the genes being capable to\n variably but deterministically skip parts of their
    sequence to be read\n (introns). A single variantly spliced gene may then yield
    different\n sequences (isoforms) and the RNA-seq evaluation better informs about\n\
    \ this. It may be relevant for a disease.\n .\n Sailfish is particularly good
    (efficient) in this process. It tricks\n the complexity by introducing an intermediate
    level of artificial very\n short reads to which the alternative splicing is of
    no concern. That\n can then be addressed by \"telephone-book\"-like hashing techniques
    that\n are easy and lightning fast. The final presentation is then found to\n\
    \ be competitive with established mappers like eXpress and Cufflinks."
