summary: RNA-seq expression estimation
description: >
   RNA-seq is a technology to read at least parts of individual RNA
   sequences of a tissue sample. After assigning these reads to genes
   that are likely responsible to have coded for them (mapping), this
   gives an insight (estimate) about how much these genes have been
   active (expressed) in that sample. The trickier bits in that process
   to address is the similarity of genes and the genes being capable to
   variably but deterministically skip parts of their sequence to be read
   (introns). A single variantly spliced gene may then yield different
   sequences (isoforms) and the RNA-seq evaluation better informs about
   this. It may be relevant for a disease.
   .
   Sailfish is particularly good (efficient) in this process. It tricks
   the complexity by introducing an intermediate level of artificial very
   short reads to which the alternative splicing is of no concern. That
   can then be addressed by "telephone-book"-like hashing techniques that
   are easy and lightning fast. The final presentation is then found to
   be competitive with established mappers like eXpress and Cufflinks.
