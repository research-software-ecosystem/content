    "description": "Topino is a graphical tool for quantitative assessment of molecular stream separations. In molecular-stream separation (MSS), a stream of a multi-component mixture is separated into multiple streams of individual components. Quantitative evaluation of MSS data has been a bottleneck in MSS for decades as there was no conventional way to present the data in a reproducible and uniform fashion. The roots of the problem were in the multi-dimensional nature of MSS data; even in the ideal case of steady-state separation, the data is three-dimensional: intensity and two spatial coordinates.",
