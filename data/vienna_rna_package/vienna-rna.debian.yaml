  description: RNA sequence analysis
  long_description: " The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library and several\n
    stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary\n structures.
    It is developed and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker\n in Vienna.\n .\n
    RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the\n most used
    function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic\n programming algorithms
    for structure prediction:\n  * the minimum free energy algorithm of (Zuker & Stiegler
    1981) which\n    yields a single optimal structure,\n  * the partition function
    algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates\n    base pair probabilities in
    the thermodynamic ensemble, and the\n    suboptimal folding algorithm of (Wuchty
    et.al 1999) which generates\n    all suboptimal structures within a given energy
    range of the optimal\n    energy.\n .\n For secondary structure comparison, the
    package contains several\n measures of distance (dissimilarities) using either
    string alignment or\n tree-editing (Shapiro & Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided
    an algorithm\n to design sequences with a predefined structure (inverse folding).\n
    The RNAforester package is a tool for aligning RNA secondary structures\n and
    it's user interface integrates to those of the tools of the\n Vienna RNA package.\n"
