  description: RNA sequence analysis
  long_description: " The Vienna RNA Package consists of a C code library and several\n\
    \ stand-alone programs for the prediction and comparison of RNA secondary\n structures.\
    \ It is developed and maintained by the group of Ivo Hofacker\n in Vienna.\n .\n\
    \ RNA secondary structure prediction through energy minimization is the\n most\
    \ used function in the package. It provides three kinds of dynamic\n programming\
    \ algorithms for structure prediction:\n  * the minimum free energy algorithm\
    \ of (Zuker & Stiegler 1981) which\n    yields a single optimal structure,\n \
    \ * the partition function algorithm of (McCaskill 1990) which calculates\n  \
    \  base pair probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble, and the\n    suboptimal\
    \ folding algorithm of (Wuchty et.al 1999) which generates\n    all suboptimal\
    \ structures within a given energy range of the optimal\n    energy.\n .\n For\
    \ secondary structure comparison, the package contains several\n measures of distance\
    \ (dissimilarities) using either string alignment or\n tree-editing (Shapiro &\
    \ Zhang 1990). Finally, is provided an algorithm\n to design sequences with a\
    \ predefined structure (inverse folding).\n The RNAforester package is a tool\
    \ for aligning RNA secondary structures\n and it's user interface integrates to\
    \ those of the tools of the\n Vienna RNA package.\n"
