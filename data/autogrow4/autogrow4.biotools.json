                "abstract": "We here present AutoGrow4, an open-source program for semi-automated computer-aided drug discovery. AutoGrow4 uses a genetic algorithm to evolve predicted ligands on demand and so is not limited to a virtual library of pre-enumerated compounds. It is a useful tool for generating entirely novel drug-like molecules and for optimizing preexisting ligands. By leveraging recent computational and cheminformatics advancements, AutoGrow4 is faster, more stable, and more modular than previous versions. It implements new docking-program compatibility, chemical filters, multithreading options, and selection methods to support a wide range of user needs. To illustrate both de novo design and lead optimization, we here apply AutoGrow4 to the catalytic domain of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1), a well characterized DNA-damage-recognition protein. AutoGrow4 produces drug-like compounds with better predicted binding affinities than FDA-approved PARP-1 inhibitors (positive controls). The predicted binding modes of the AutoGrow4 compounds mimic those of the known inhibitors, even when AutoGrow4 is seeded with random small molecules.
