In parallel, increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and associated protein-coding genes, as well as terms contained in the annotations, such as the tissues in which the transcripts are expressed and associated diseases. In addition, lncRNAdb is linked to the UCSC Genome Browser for visualization and Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) for expression information from a variety of sources. lncRNAdb provides a platform for the ongoing collation of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs and their association with other genomic elements. lncRNAdb can be accessed at: Http://www .lncrnadb.org/. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Amaral P.P.","Clark M.B.","Gascoigne D.K.","Dinger M.E.","Mattick J.S."],"cit_count":352,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21112873","title":"LncRNAdb: A reference database for long noncoding RNAs","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:lncrnadb","biotoolsID":"lncrnadb","description":"Database containing a comprehensive list of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles.
