All rights reserved.Targeted analysis of data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry data requires elegant software tools and strict statistical control. OpenSWATH-PyProphet-TRIC is a widely used DIA data analysis workflow. The OpenSWATH-PyProphet-TRIC workflow is typically executed by running command lines. Here, we present QuantPipe, which is a graphic interface software tool based on the OpenSWATH-PyProphet-TRIC workflow. In addition to OpenSWATH-PyProphet-TRIC functions, QuantPipe can convert the spectral library to the assay library and output peptides and protein intensities. We demonstrated that QuantPipe can be used to analyze SWATH-MS data from TripleTOF 5600 and TripleTOF 6600, phospho-SWATH-MS data, DIA data from Orbitrap instrument, and diaPASEF data from TimsTOF Pro instrument. The executable files, user manual, and source code of QuantPipe are freely available at https://github.com/tachengxmu/QuantPipe/releases.",
