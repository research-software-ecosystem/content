                "abstract": "Despite efforts during the past decades, loop modeling remains a difficult part of protein structure modeling. Several approaches have been developed in the framework of crystal structures. However, for homology models, the modeling of loops is still far from being solved. We propose DaReUS-Loop, a data-based approach that identifies loop candidates mining the complete set of experimental structures available in the Protein Data Bank. Candidate filtering relies on local conformation profile-profile comparison, together with physico-chemical scoring. Applied to three different template-based test sets, DaReUS-Loop shows significant increase in the number of high-accuracy loops, and significant enhancement for modeling long loops. A special advantage is that our method proposes a prediction confidence score that correlates well with the expected accuracy of the loops. Strikingly, over 50% of successful loop models are derived from unrelated proteins, indicating that fragments under similar constraints tend to adopt similar structure, beyond mere homology.",

                "abstract": "Loop regions in protein structures often have crucial roles, and they are much more variable in sequence and structure than other regions. In homology modeling, this leads to larger deviations from the homologous templates, and loop modeling of homology models remains an open problem. To address this issue, we have previously developed the DaReUS-Loop protocol, leading to significant improvement over existing methods. Here, a DaReUS-Loop web server is presented, providing an automated platform for modeling or remodeling loops in the context of homology models. This is the first web server accepting a protein with up to 20 loop regions, and modeling them all in parallel. It also provides a prediction confidence level that corresponds to the expected accuracy of the loops. DaReUS-Loop facilitates the analysis of the results through its interactive graphical interface and is freely available at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/DaReUS-Loop/.",
