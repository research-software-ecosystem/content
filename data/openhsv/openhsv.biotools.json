                "abstract": "\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).High-speed videoendoscopy is an important tool to study laryngeal dynamics, to quantify vocal fold oscillations, to diagnose voice impairments at laryngeal level and to monitor treatment progress. However, there is a significant lack of an open source, expandable research tool that features latest hardware and data analysis. In this work, we propose an open research platform termed OpenHSV that is based on state-of-the-art, commercially available equipment and features a fully automatic data analysis pipeline. A publicly available, user-friendly graphical user interface implemented in Python is used to interface the hardware. Video and audio data are recorded in synchrony and are subsequently fully automatically analyzed. Video segmentation of the glottal area is performed using efficient deep neural networks to derive glottal area waveform and glottal midline. Established quantitative, clinically relevant video and audio parameters were implemented and computed. In a preliminary clinical study, we recorded video and audio data from 28 healthy subjects. Analyzing these data in terms of image quality and derived quantitative parameters, we show the applicability, performance and usefulness of OpenHSV. Therefore, OpenHSV provides a valid, standardized access to high-speed videoendoscopy data acquisition and analysis for voice scientists, highlighting its use as a valuable research tool in understanding voice physiology. We envision that OpenHSV serves as basis for the next generation of clinical HSV systems.",
