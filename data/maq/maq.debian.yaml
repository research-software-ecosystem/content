summary: maps short fixed-length polymorphic DNA sequence reads to reference sequences
description: >
   Maq (short for Mapping and Assembly with Quality) builds mapping assemblies
   from short reads generated by the next-generation sequencing machines. It was
   particularly designed for Illumina-Solexa 1G Genetic Analyzer, and has a
   preliminary functionality to handle ABI SOLiD data. Maq is previously known as
   mapass2.
   .
   Developmemt of Maq stopped in 2008. Its successors are BWA and SAMtools.
