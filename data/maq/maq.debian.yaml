description: Maq (short for Mapping and Assembly with Quality) builds mapping assemblies
  from short reads generated by the next-generation sequencing machines. It was particularly
  designed for Illumina-Solexa 1G Genetic Analyzer, and has a preliminary functionality
  to handle ABI SOLiD data. Maq is previously known as mapass2. . Developmemt of Maq
