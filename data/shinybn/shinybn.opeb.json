It's mainly based on five R packages: bnlearn for structure learning, parameter training, gRain for network inference, and visNetwork for network visualization, pROC and rmda for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and decision curves analysis (DCA) , respectively, which was further wrapped by Shiny, a framework to build interactive web application straight by R","homepage":"https://jiajin.shinyapps.io/shinyBN/","name":"shinyBN"}}
