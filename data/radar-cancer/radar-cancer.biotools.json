Running RADAR through the website will print the results after several moments. You can try running RADAR through the web form with a sample file with one variant. Alternatively, you may also input a list of variants into the form as text. If variants are provided in both file and text formats, the variant file will be scored and the text field will be ignored.\n\nDirectory containing files, one for each chromosome.",

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s).RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play key roles in post-transcriptional regulation and disease. Their binding sites cover more of the genome than coding exons; nevertheless, most noncoding variant prioritization methods only focus on transcriptional regulation. Here, we integrate the portfolio of ENCODE-RBP experiments to develop RADAR, a variant-scoring framework. RADAR uses conservation, RNA structure, network centrality, and motifs to provide an overall impact score. Then, it further incorporates tissue-specific inputs to highlight disease-specific variants. Our results demonstrate RADAR can successfully pinpoint variants, both somatic and germline, associated with RBP-function dysregulation, which cannot be found by most current prioritization methods, for example, variants affecting splicing.",
