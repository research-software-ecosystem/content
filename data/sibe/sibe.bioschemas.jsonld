      "sc:description": "a computation tool to apply protein sequence statistics to predict folding and design in silico | We love Sibe and the work Sibe does. We work closely with our | Sibe is an analytical and computational framework, and it aims to provide a powerful tool for biological science, such as sequence data analysis, in silico protein folding and design. Though much of the software suite is oriented toward basic research on protein sequence analysis, folding and design, Sibe is also designed for extracting meaningful information hidden behind `big data' based on machine learning. With the help of statistical analysis methods, Sibe can infer co-evolutionary information encoded in protein amino acids sequences for protein folding and design. Now, Sibe includes seven easy-interfaced modules, several physical- & chemical-principles and statistical analysis methods, as well as different optimization solvers",
