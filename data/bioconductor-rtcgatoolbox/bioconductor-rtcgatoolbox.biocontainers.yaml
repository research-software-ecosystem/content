description: Managing data from large scale projects such as the cancer genome atlas
  (tcga) for further analysis is an important and time consuming step for research
  projects. firehose project makes tcga pre-processed data publicly available via
  web services and data portals but it requires managing, downloading and preparing
  the data for following steps. we developed an open source and extensible r based
  data client for firehose pre-processed data and demonstrated its use with sample
  case studies.
