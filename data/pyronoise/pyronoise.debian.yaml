summary: removal of noise from 454 sequenced PCR amplicons
description: >
   AmpliconNoise is a package of applications to clean up high-throughput
   sequence data.  It consists of three main parts:
   .
   Pyronoise - does flowgram-based clustering to spot misreads
   SeqNoise - removes PCR point mutations
   Perseus - removes PCR chimeras without the need for a set of reference
   sequences
   .
   Previously there was a standalone "Pyronoise" by the same authors and
   this package includes an updated version.  There is also a "Denoiser"
   in Qiime which is related but distinct.
