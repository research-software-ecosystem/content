It integrates 5807 structurally known interactions imported from the iPfam and 3did databases and 46 900 domain interactions predicted by four computational methods: domain phylogenetic profiling, domain pair exclusion algorithm correlated mutations and domain interaction prediction in a discriminative way. Additionally predictions are filtered to exclude those domain pairs that are reported as non-interacting by the Negatome database. The DIMA Web site allows to calculate domain interaction networks either for a domain of interest or for entire organisms, and to explore them interactively using the Flash-based Cytoscape Web software. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Luo Q.","Pagel P.","Vilne B.","Frishman D."],"cit_count":25,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21097782","title":"DIMA 3.0: Domain interaction map","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dima_3.0","biotoolsID":"dima_3.0","description":"Domain Interaction MAp is a database of predicted and known interactions between protein domains.It integrates 5807 structurally known interactions imported from the iPfam and 3did databases and 46,900 domain interactions predicted by four computational methods:domain phylogenetic profiling,domain pair exclusion algorithm correlated mutations and domain interaction prediction.The predictions are filtered to exclude those domain pairs that are reported as non-interacting by the Negatome database.","homepage":"http://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/dima","name":"DIMA 3.0"}}
