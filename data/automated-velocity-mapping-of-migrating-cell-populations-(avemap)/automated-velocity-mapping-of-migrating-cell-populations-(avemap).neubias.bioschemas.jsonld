  "http://schema.org/description": "Requires Matlab Runtime Environment or Matlab.\r\nSource code (m-files) are downloaded.\r\n\r\nSoftware availability:\r\nAVeMap was developed under MATLAB (MathWorks). It is available as an executable, multiplatform program, together with source codes and documentation at http://umr168.curie.fr/en/avemap, and the source code is also available as Supplementary Software. For practical reasons, this executable version, which does not require MATLAB, runs on a single processor. For users who want to customize the software and/or need the power of parallel computing, an installation of MATLAB with its 'parallel' and 'image processing' toolboxes is needed. Note that, even with the executable version, the velocity fields are stored for further analysis. The add-on AVeMap+ uses these AVeMap-computed velocity fields to generate heat map tables. It is available with the same link.",
