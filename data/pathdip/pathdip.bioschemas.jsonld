Data integration and predictions increase coverage of pathway annotations for human proteome to 92%. pathDIP annotates 122,131 unique proteins in 6,401 pathways in 17 organisms (including 18,454 human proteins), annotates 36,216 pathway orphans (including 5,366 human proteins), and provides multiple query, analysis and output options.",
