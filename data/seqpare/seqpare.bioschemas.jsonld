With this metric, the similarity of two interval sets is quantified by a single index, which directly represents the percentage of their effective overlapping: a similarity index of zero indicates totally unrelated sequences, and an index of one means that the interval sets are exactly the same. Seqpare tool provides functions for both searching and mapping large-scale interval datasets. The seqpare code is based on ailist.",
