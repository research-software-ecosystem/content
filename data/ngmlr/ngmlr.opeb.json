Structural variations are the greatest source of genetic variation, but they remain poorly understood because of technological limitations. Single-molecule long-read sequencing has the potential to dramatically advance the field, although high error rates are a challenge with existing methods. Addressing this need, we introduce open-source methods for long-read alignment (NGMLR; https://github.com/philres/ngmlr) and structural variant identification (Sniffles; https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles) that provide unprecedented sensitivity and precision for variant detection, even in repeat-rich regions and for complex nested events that can have substantial effects on human health. In several long-read datasets, including healthy and cancerous human genomes, we discovered thousands of novel variants and categorized systematic errors in short-read approaches. NGMLR and Sniffles can automatically filter false events and operate on low-coverage data, thereby reducing the high costs that have hindered the application of long reads in clinical and research settings.","authors":["Sedlazeck F.J.","Rescheneder P.","Smolka M.","Fang H.","Nattestad M.","Von Haeseler A.","Schatz M.C."],"cit_count":22,"doi":"10.1038/s41592-018-0001-7","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Accurate detection of complex structural variations using single-molecule sequencing","year":"2018-06-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ngmlr","biotoolsID":"ngmlr","description":"An algorithm to map third generation long-read sequencing data (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore) to a reference genome with a focus on reads that span structural variation.","homepage":"https://github.com/philres/ngmlr","name":"NGMLR"}}
