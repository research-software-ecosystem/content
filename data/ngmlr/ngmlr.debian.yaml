  description: CoNvex Gap-cost alignMents for Long Reads
  long_description: " Ngmlr is a long-read mapper designed to sensitively align PacBilo
    or\n Oxford Nanopore to (large) reference genomes. It was designed to quickly\n
    and correctly align the reads, including those spanning (complex)\n structural
    variations. Ngmlr uses an SV aware k-mer search to find\n approximate mapping
    locations for a read and then a banded Smith-\n Waterman alignment algorithm to
    compute the final alignment. Ngmlr uses\n a convex gap cost model that penalizes
    gap extensions for longer gaps\n less than for shorter ones to compute precise
    alignments.\n"
