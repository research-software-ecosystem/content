    "description": "Workflows in Galaxy can be complex and difficult to create from thousands of tools, especially for researchers new to Galaxy. To help researchers with creating workflows, a system is developed to recommend tools which can facilitate further data analysis. The recommendation model is accessed by a Galaxy API to provide researchers with recommended tools in an interactive manner using multiple user interface (UI) integrations on the European Galaxy server. Good quality and highly-used tools are shown at the top of the recommended tools. The system developed is available as open-source software.",
