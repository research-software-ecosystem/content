The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project has generated many tools leading to important insights into the function and druggability of these so-called ‘dark’ receptors. These tools include assays, such as PRESTO-TANGO and TRUPATH, billions of small molecules made available via the ZINC virtual library, solved orphan GPCR structures, GPCR knock-in mice, and more. Together, these tools are illuminating the remaining ‘dark’ GPCRs.",
