First, support vector machine (SVM)-based modules for predicting subcellular localization using traditional amino acid and dipeptide (i + 1) composition achieved overall accuracy of 76.6 and 77.8%, respectively. PSI-BLAST, when carried out using a similarity-based search against a nonredundant data base of experimentally annotated proteins, yielded 73.3% accuracy. To gain further insight, a hybrid module (hybrid1) was developed based on amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, and similarity information and attained better accuracy of 84.9%. In addition, SVM modules based on a different higher order dipeptide Le. i + 2, i + 3, and i + 4 were also constructed for the prediction of subcellular localization of human proteins, and overall accuracy of 79.7, 77.5, and 77.1% was accomplished, respectively. Furthermore, another SVM module hybrid2 was developed using traditional dipeptide (i + 1) and higher order dipeptide (t + 2, i + 3, and i + 4) compositions, which gave an overall accuracy of 81.3%. We also developed SVM module hybrids based on amino acid composition, traditional and higher order dipeptide compositions, and PSI-BLAST output and achieved an overall accuracy of 84.4%.
