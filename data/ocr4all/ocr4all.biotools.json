    "description": "> COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pymzml (GITHUB.COM) | An Open-Source Tool Providing a (Semi-)Automatic OCR Workflow for Historical Printings | Shell script for installing OCR4all in an 64bit ubuntu virtualBox image | Pretrained mixed models to be used in OCR4all | Zentrum f\u00fcr Philologie und Digitalit\u00e4t \"Kallimachos\" | OCR4all is a software designed to digitally explore primarily very early printed texts whose elaborate printing types and often uneven layout concepts are beyond the recognition abilities of most other recognition software. Understandably and independently to use, OCR4all\u2019s suggested semi-automatic workflow also explicitly focusses users with no technical background and combines different tools in one consistent interface. A frequent change between software is not necessary anymore",
