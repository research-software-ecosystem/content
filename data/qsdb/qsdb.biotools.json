Published by Oxford University Press.The human microbiome is largely shaped by the chemical interactions of its microbial members, which includes cross-talk via shared signals or quenching of the signalling of other species. Quorum sensing is a process that allows microbes to coordinate their behaviour in dependence of their population density and to adjust gene expression accordingly. We present the Quorum Sensing Database (QSDB), a comprehensive database of all published sensing and quenching relations between organisms and signalling molecules of the human microbiome, as well as an interactive web interface that allows browsing the database, provides graphical depictions of sensing mechanisms as Systems Biology Graphical Notation diagrams and links to other databases.",
