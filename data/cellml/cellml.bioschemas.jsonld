MathML embedded in CellML documents is used to define the underlyingmathematics  of models. Models  consist  of  a  network of reusable  components,  each  with  variables  andequations giving relationships between those variables. Models may import other models to create systems ofincreasing complexity. CellML 2.0 is defined by the normative specification presented here, prescribing theCellML syntax and the rules by which it should be used.",
