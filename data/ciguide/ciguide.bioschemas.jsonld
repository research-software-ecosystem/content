It provides in situ augmented reality guidance for microscopic interventions at the lateral skull base with minimal mental and workload overhead on surgeons working without a monitor and dedicated pointing tools. METHODS : Three components were developed: a registration tool (Rhinospider), a hybrid magneto-optic-tracked robotic feedback control scheme and a modified robotic end-effector. Rhinospider optimizes registration of patient and preoperative CT data by excluding user errors in fiducial localization with magnetic tracking",
