description: 'This package allows to work with mixed omics data (transcriptomics,
  proteomics, microarray-chips, rna-seq data), introducing the following improvements:
  distance options (for numeric and/or categorical variables) for each of the tables,
  bootstrap resampling techniques on the residuals matrices for all methods, that
  enable perform confidence ellipses for the projection of individuals, variables
  and biplot methodology to project variables (gene expression) on the compromise.
  Since the main purpose of the package is to use these techniques to omic data analysis,
  it includes an example data from four different microarray platforms (i.e.,Agilent,
  Affymetrix HGU 95, Affymetrix HGU 133 and Affymetrix HGU 133plus 2.0) on the NCI-60
  cell lines.NCI60_4arrays is a list containing the NCI-60 microarray data with only
  few hundreds of genes randomly selected in each platform to keep the size of the
  package small. The data are the same that the package omicade4 used to implement
  the co-inertia analysis. The references in packages follow the style of the APA-6th
  norm.'
