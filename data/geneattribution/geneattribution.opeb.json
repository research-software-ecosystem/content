Motivation: We have developed geneAttribution, an R package that assigns candidate causal gene(s) to a risk variant identified by a genetic association study such as a GWAS. The method combines user-supplied functional annotation such as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) or Hi-C genome conformation data and reports the most likely candidate genes. In the absence of annotation data, geneAttribution relies on the distances between the genes and the input variant.","authors":["Wuster A.","Chang D.","Behrens T.W.","Bhangale T.R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw698","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"GeneAttribution: Trait agnostic identification of candidate genes associated with noncoding variation","type":"Primary","year":"2017-02-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:geneattribution","biotoolsID":"geneattribution","description":"Identification of the most likely gene or genes through which variation at a given genomic locus in the human genome acts. The most basic functionality assumes that the closer gene is to the input locus, the more likely the gene is to be causative. Additionally, any empirical data that links genomic regions to genes (e.g. eQTL or genome conformation data) can be used if it is supplied in the UCSC .BED file format.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/geneAttribution.html","name":"geneAttribution","version":["1.0.0"]}}
