Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation There are many multiple testing correction methods. Some of them are robust to various dependencies in the data while others are not. Some of the implementations have problems for managing high dimensional list of P-values as currently demanded by microarray and other omic technologies. Results The program Myriads, formerly SGoF+, provides some of the most important P-value-based correction methods jointly with a test of dependency and a P-value simulator. Myriads easily manage hundreds of thousands of P-values.
