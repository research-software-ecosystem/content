Some of them are robust to various dependencies in the data while others are not. Some of the implementations have problems for managing high dimensional list of P-values as currently demanded by microarray and other omic technologies. Results The program Myriads, formerly SGoF+, provides some of the most important P-value-based correction methods jointly with a test of dependency and a P-value simulator. Myriads easily manage hundreds of thousands of P-values.
