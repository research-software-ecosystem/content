Guest users can use the system anonymously, with full access to (i) standard bioinformatics programs (e.g. PSI-BLAST, ClustalW, T-Coffee, Jalview); (ii) a large number of protein sequence databases, including standard (Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL) and locally developed databases (splice variants); (iii) databases of protein motifs (Prosite, Interpro); (iv) a precomputed list of matches ('hits') between the sequence and motif databases. All databases are updated on a weekly basis and the hit list is kept up to date incrementally. The MyHits server also includes a new collection of tools to generate graphical representations of pairwise and multiple sequence alignments including their annotated features. Free registration enables users to upload their own sequences and motifs to private databases. These are then made available through the same web interface and the same set of analytical tools. Registered users can manage their own sequences and annotations using only web tools and freeze their data in their private database for publication purposes. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.", "citationCount": 72, "authors": [{"name": "Pagni M."}, {"name": "Ioannidis V."}, {"name": "Cerutti L."}, {"name": "Zahn-Zabal M."}, {"name": "Jongeneel C.V."}, {"name": "Falquet L."}], "date": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": [], "name": "SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Marco Pagni", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "marco.pagni@isb-sib.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:myhits", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://myhits.isb-sib.ch", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein fold recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}, {"term": "Protein domain recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0246"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The MyHits server integrates several tools with a focus on protein annotation and the analysis of protein domains.
