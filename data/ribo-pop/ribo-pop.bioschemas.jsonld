      "sc:description": "Simple, cost-effective, and widely applicable ribosomal RNA depletion.\n\nSnakemake workflow: ribopop_probe_design.\n\nThis workflow designs oligos that hybridize to rRNA targets. First, a consensus sequence is built for each target. Next, potential probe target sites are screened against the genome and the transcriptome for non-rRNA matches. Finally, probes are selected to cover the targets, while adhering to the specified design parameters and avoiding the predicted non-specific targeting.\n\nSnakemake workflow: ribopop_rnaseq.\n\nThis workflow performs analysis of RNA-Seq data for the Ribo-Pop paper.\n\nIf you're not using conda, you will need to install snakemake as well as all the other software listed in envs/ribopop_probe_design.yaml in advance of running the workflow using your preferred installation method.",
