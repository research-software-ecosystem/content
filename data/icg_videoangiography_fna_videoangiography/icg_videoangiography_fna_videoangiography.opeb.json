This review summarizes the current knowledge about using FNa videoangiography in vascular neurosurgery. Methods: We performed a literature review on the usage of FNa for fluorescent videoangiography procedures in neurosurgery. We analyzed methods of injection, dosages of FNa, visualizing platforms, and interpretation of FNa videoangiography. We also reviewed practical applications of FNa videoangiography during various vascular neurosurgeries.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'videoangiography FNa videoangiography', 'FNa videoangiography', 'ICG videoangiography FNa', 'videoangiography'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31620443","name":"ICG videoangiography FNa videoangiography"}}
