                "abstract": "Motivation: The constant advances in sequencing technology are turning whole-genome sequencing into a routine procedure, resulting in massive amounts of data that need to be processed. Tens of gigabytes of data in the form of short reads need to be mapped back to reference sequences, a few gigabases long. A first generation of short read alignment software successfully employed hash tables, and the currentsecond generation uses Burrows-Wheeler Transform, further improving mapping speed. However, there is still demand for faster and more accurate mapping. Results: In this paper, we present REad ALigner, an efficient, accurate and consistent tool for aligning short reads obtained from next generation sequencing. It is based on a new, simple, yet efficient mapping algorithm that can match and outperform current BWT-based software. Copyright \u00a9 2010 ACM.",
