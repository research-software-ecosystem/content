Tens of gigabytes of data in the form of short reads need to be mapped back to reference sequences, a few gigabases long. A first generation of short read alignment software successfully employed hash tables, and the currentsecond generation uses Burrows-Wheeler Transform, further improving mapping speed. However, there is still demand for faster and more accurate mapping. Results: In this paper, we present REad ALigner, an efficient, accurate and consistent tool for aligning short reads obtained from next generation sequencing. It is based on a new, simple, yet efficient mapping algorithm that can match and outperform current BWT-based software.
