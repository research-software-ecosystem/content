      "sc:description": "CRISPRLand, relies on an unexploited observation about the nature of the repair process: the landscape of the DNA repair is highly sparse in the (Walsh–Hadamard) spectral domain. This observation enables our framework to address key shortcomings that limit the interpretability and scaling of current deep-learning-based DNA repair models. In particular. ur proposed framework is based on a divide-and-conquer strategy that uses a fast peeling algorithm to learn the DNA repair models. CRISPRLand captures lower-degree features around the cut site, which enrich for short insertions and deletions as well as higher-degree microhomology patterns that enrich for longer deletions.",
