In the paper we present QuickProbs, the variant of MSAProbs customised for graphics processors. We selected the two most time consuming stages of MSAProbs to be redesigned for GPU execution: the posterior matrices calculation and the consistency transformation. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (BAliBASE, PREFAB, OXBench-X) on quad-core PC equipped with high-end graphics card show QuickProbs to be 5.7 to 9.7 times faster than original CPU-parallel MSAProbs. Additional tests performed on several protein families from Pfam database give overall speed-up of 6.7. Compared to other algorithms like MAFFT, MUSCLE, or ClustalW, QuickProbs proved to be much more accurate at similar speed. Additionally we introduce a tuned variant of QuickProbs which is significantly more accurate on sets of distantly related sequences than MSAProbs without exceeding its computation time. The GPU part of QuickProbs was implemented in OpenCL, thus the package is suitable for graphics processors produced by all major vendors. \u00a9 2014 Gudy\u015b, Deorowicz.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Gudys A."}, {"name": "Deorowicz S."}], "date": "2014-02-25T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "adam.gudys@polsl.pl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:quickprobs", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=projects&project=quickprobs&subpage=about", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Multiple sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0492"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast multiple sequence alignment algorithm designed for graphics processors.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++", "Perl", "C"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/quickprobs-multiple-sequence-alignment-designed-especially-for-gpu.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "quickprobs", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:57:15Z", "name": "QuickProbs", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=projects&project=quickprobs&subpage=about", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows"]}
