description: 'Ea-utils provides a set of command-line tools for processing biological
  sequencing data, barcode demultiplexing, adapter trimming, etc. . Primarily written
  to support an Illumina based pipeline - but should work with any FASTQs. . Main
  Tools are: . * fastq-mcf Scans a sequence file for adapters, and, based on a log-scaled
  threshold, determines a set of clipping parameters and performs clipping. Also does
  skewing detection and quality filtering. * fastq-multx Demultiplexes a fastq. Capable
  of auto-determining barcode id''s based on a master set fields. Keeps multiple reads
  in-sync during demultiplexing. Can verify that the reads are in-sync as well, and
  fail if they''re not. * fastq-join Similar to audy''s stitch program, but in C,
  more efficient and supports some automatic benchmarking and tuning. It uses the
  same "squared distance for anchored alignment" as other tools. * varcall Takes a
  pileup and calculates variants in a more easily parameterized manner than some other
  tools.'
