The algorithm, RNATABUPATH, employs a TABU semi-greedy heuristic, known to be an effective search strategy in combinatorial optimization. Folding pathways, sometimes called routes or trajectories, are computed by RNATABUPATH in a fraction of the time required by the BARRIERS program of Vienna RNA Package. We benchmark RNATABUPATH with other algorithms to compute low energy folding pathways between experimentally known structures of several conformational switches.
