    "description": "A web server to compute near-optimal folding pathways between two given secondary structures for a given RNA sequence. Since this problem is known to be NP-complete, our main algorithm, RNAtabupath uses the TABU local search heuristic. The web server includes both downloadable source code for several algorithms, as well as a web engine to compute pathways. Intended applications concern folding pathways for RNA conformational switches.",

                "abstract": "Given an RNA sequence and two designated secondary structures A, B, we describe a new algorithm that computes a nearly optimal folding pathway from A to B. The algorithm, RNATABUPATH, employs a TABU semi-greedy heuristic, known to be an effective search strategy in combinatorial optimization. Folding pathways, sometimes called routes or trajectories, are computed by RNATABUPATH in a fraction of the time required by the BARRIERS program of Vienna RNA Package. We benchmark RNATABUPATH with other algorithms to compute low energy folding pathways between experimentally known structures of several conformational switches. The RNAPATHFINDER web server, source code for algorithms to compute and analyze pathways and supplementary data are available at http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNApathfinder. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2009.
