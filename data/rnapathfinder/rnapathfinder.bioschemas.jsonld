Since this problem is known to be NP-complete, our main algorithm, RNAtabupath uses the TABU local search heuristic. The web server includes both downloadable source code for several algorithms, as well as a web engine to compute pathways. Intended applications concern folding pathways for RNA conformational switches.",
