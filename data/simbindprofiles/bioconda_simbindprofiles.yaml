description: SimBindProfiles identifies common and unique binding regions in genome
  tiling array data. This package does not rely on peak calling, but directly compares
  binding profiles processed on the same array platform. It implements a simple threshold
  approach, thus allowing retrieval of commonly and differentially bound regions between
  datasets as well as events of compensation and increased binding.
