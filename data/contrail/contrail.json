Sequence read lengths, initially very short, have rapidly increased since the technology first appeared, and we now are seeing a growing number of efforts to sequence large genomes de novo from these short reads. In this Perspective, we describe the issues associated with short-read assembly, the different types of data produced by second-gen sequencers, and the latest assembly algorithms designed for these data. We also review the genomes that have been assembled recently from short reads and make recommendations for sequencing strategies that will yield a high-quality assembly. \u00a9 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 251, "authors": [{"name": "Schatz M.C."}, {"name": "Delcher A.L."}, {"name": "Salzberg S.L."}], "date": "2010-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Steven L.
