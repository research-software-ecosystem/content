      "sc:description": "A tool for quality control, filter and curation of microRNAs of animals and plants.\n\nMirCure: A tool for quality control, filter, and curation of microRNAs of animals and plants.\n\nGiven a list of miRNA candidates, MirCure evaluates a number of miRNA-specific features based on gene expression, biogenesis, and conservation data, and generates a score that can be used to discard poorly supported miRNA annotations. MirCure can also curate and adjust the annotation of the 5p and 3p arms based on user-provided small RNA-seq data. We evaluated MirCure on a set of manually curated animal and plant microRNAs and demonstrated great accuracy. Moreover, we show that MirCure can be used to revisit previous bona fide miRNAs annotations to improve microRNA databases.",
