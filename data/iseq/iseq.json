The most important feature of ChIP-chip data is that the intensity measurements of probes are spatially correlated because the DNA fragments are hybridized to neighboring probes in the experiments. We propose a simple, but powerful Bayesian hierarchical approach to ChIP-chip data through an Ising model with high-order interactions. The proposed method naturally takes into account the intrinsic spatial structure of the data and can be used to analyze data from multiple platforms with different genomic resolutions. The model parameters are estimated using the Gibbs sampler. The proposed method is illustrated using two publicly available data sets from Affymetrix and Agilent platforms, and compared with three alternative Bayesian methods, namely, Bayesian hierarchical model, hierarchical gamma mixture model, and Tilemap hidden Markov model. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method performs as well as the other three methods for the data from Affymetrix tiling arrays, but significantly outperforms the other three methods for the data from Agilent promoter arrays. In addition, we find that the proposed method has better operating characteristics in terms of sensitivities and false discovery rates under various scenarios. \u00a9 2010, The International Biometric Society.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Mo Q."}, {"name": "Liang F."}], "date": "2010-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Biometrics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Qianxing Mo", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "qmo@bcm.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:iseq", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.26.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iSeq.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Enrichment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package uses Bayesian hidden Ising models to identify IP-enriched genomic regions from ChIP-seq data.
