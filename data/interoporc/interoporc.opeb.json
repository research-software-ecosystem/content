Nevertheless, large-scale interaction networks are available for only a few model organisms. Thus, interologs are useful for a systematic transfer of protein interaction networks between organisms. However, no standard tool is available so far for that purpose. Results: In this study, we present an automated prediction tool developed for all sequenced genomes available in Integr8. We also have developed a second method to predict protein-protein interactions in the widely used cyanobacterium Synechocystis. Using these methods, we have constructed a new network of 8783 inferred interactions for Synechocystis. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.
