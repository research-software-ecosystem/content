They have received significant attention because of their extraordinary variety of activities, in particular, as candidate drugs against the threat of super-bacteria. A systematic study of the relation between the sequence and the mechanism of action is urgently needed, given the thousands of sequences already in multiple web resources. ADAPTABLE web platform (http: gec.u-picardie.fr adaptable) introduces the concept of \"property alignment\" to create families of property and sequence-related peptides (SR families). This feature provides the researcher with a tool to select those AMPs meaningful to their research from among more than 40,000 nonredundant sequences.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'gec'","homepage":"https://gitlab.com/pachoramos/ADAPTABLE","name":"ADAPTABLE"}}
