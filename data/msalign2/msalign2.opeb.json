A major drawback of CE is the poor migration time reproducibility, which makes it difficult to combine data from different experiments and correctly assign compounds. A number of alignment algorithms have been developed but not all of them can cope with large and irregular time shifts between CE-MS runs. Here we present a genetic algorithm designed for alignment of CE-MS data using accurate mass information. The utility of the algorithm was demonstrated on real data, and the results were compared with one of the existing packages. The new algorithm showed a significant reduction of elution time variation in the aligned datasets. The importance of mass accuracy for the performance of the algorithm was also demonstrated by comparing alignments of datasets from a standard time-of-flight (TOF) instrument with those from the new ultrahigh resolution TOF maXis (Bruker Daltonics). © 2009 Springer-Verlag.","authors":["Nevedomskaya E.","Derks R.","Deelder A.M.","Mayboroda O.A.","Palmblad M."],"cit_count":43,"journal":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry","pmid":"19826795","title":"Alignment of capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry datasets using accurate mass information","year":"2009-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msalign2","biotoolsID":"msalign2","description":"Aligns 2 CE-MS or LC-MS datasets using accurate mass information.","homepage":"http://www.ms-utils.org/msalign2/index.html","name":"msalign2"}}
