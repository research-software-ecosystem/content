Published by Oxford University Press.Advances in hardware automation in synthetic biology laboratories are not yet fully matched by those of their software counterparts. Such automated laboratories, now commonly called biofoundries, require software solutions that would help with many specialized tasks such as batch DNA design, sample and data tracking, and data analysis, among others. Typically, many of the challenges facing biofoundries are shared, yet there is frequent wheel-reinvention where many labs develop similar software solutions in parallel. In this article, we present the first attempt at creating a standardized, open-source Python package. A number of tools will be integrated and developed that we envisage will become the obvious starting point for software development projects within biofoundries globally. Specifically, we describe the current state of available software, present usage scenarios and case studies for common problems, and finally describe plans for future development.
