For the collection to be useful, the information must be organized in a way that supports queries that are relevant to researchers. `scfind` builds an index from scRNA-seq datasets which organizes the information in a suitable and compact manner so that the datasets can be very efficiently searched for either cells or cell types in which a given list of genes is expressed.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/scfind.html","name":"scfind","version":["1.2.0"]}}
