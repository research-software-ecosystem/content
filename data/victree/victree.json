Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: The increasing rate of submission of genetic sequences into public databases is providing a growing resource for classifying the organisms that these sequences represent. To aid viral classification, we have developed ViCTree, which automatically integrates the relevant sets of sequences in NCBI GenBank and transforms them into an interactive maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree that can be updated automatically. ViCTree incorporates ViCTreeView, which is a JavaScript-based visualization tool that enables the tree to be explored interactively in the context of pairwise distance data. Results: To demonstrate utility, ViCTree was applied to subfamily Densovirinae of family Parvoviridae. This led to the identification of six new species of insect virus.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Modha S."}, {"name": "Thanki A.S."}, {"name": "Cotmore S.F."}, {"name": "Davison A.J."}, {"name": "Hughes J."}], "date": "2018-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Sejal Modha", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sejal.modha@glasgow.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:victree", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/victree_web/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2995"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Automated framework for taxonomic classification from protein sequences.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "victree", "additionDate": "2018-07-01T11:05:54Z", "name": "ViCTree", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinformatics.cvr.ac.uk/victree_web/tutorial.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
