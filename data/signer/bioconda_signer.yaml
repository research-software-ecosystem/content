description: The signeR package provides an empirical Bayesian approach to mutational
  signature discovery. It is designed to analyze single nucleotide variation (SNV)
  counts in cancer genomes, but can also be applied to other features as well. Functionalities
  to characterize signatures or genome samples according to exposure patterns are
  also provided.
