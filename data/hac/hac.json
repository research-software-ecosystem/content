Network clustering is a valuable approach for summarizing the structure in large networks, for predicting unobserved interactions, and for predicting functional annotations. Many current clustering algorithms suffer from a common set of limitations: poor resolution of top-level clusters; over-splitting of bottom-level clusters; requirements to pre-define the number of clusters prior to analysis; and an inability to jointly cluster over multiple interaction types.Results: A new algorithm, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), is developed for fast clustering of heterogeneous interaction networks. This algorithm uses maximum likelihood to drive the inference of a hierarchical stochastic block model for network structure. Bayesian model selection provides a principled method for collapsing the fine-structure within the smallest groups, and for identifying the top-level groups within a network. Model scores are additive over independent interaction types, providing a direct route for simultaneous analysis of multiple interaction types. In addition to inferring network structure, this algorithm generates link predictions that with cross-validation provide a quantitative assessment of performance for real-world examples.Conclusions: When applied to genome-scale data sets representing several organisms and interaction types, HAC provides the overall best performance in link prediction when compared with other clustering methods and with model-free graph diffusion kernels. Investigation of performance on genome-scale yeast protein interactions reveals roughly 100 top-level clusters, with a long-tailed distribution of cluster sizes. These are in turn partitioned into 1000 fine-level clusters containing 5 proteins on average, again with a long-tailed size distribution. Top-level clusters correspond to broad biological processes, whereas fine-level clusters correspond to discrete complexes. Surprisingly, link prediction based on joint clustering of physical and genetic interactions performs worse than predictions based on individual data sets, suggesting a lack of synergy in current high-throughput data. \u00a9 2011 Park and Bader; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Park Y."}, {"name": "Bader J.S."}], "date": "2011-02-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://baderzone.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hac", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://code.google.com/p/hacml/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool developed for fast clustering of heterogeneous interaction networks.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/hac-hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering-for-a-large-scale-network-data.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "hac", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:45:47Z", "name": "HAC", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
