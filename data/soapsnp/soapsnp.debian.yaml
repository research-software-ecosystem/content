description: For getting ideas on the cause of diseases or their response to therapy,
  and for understanding either for a particular patient, doctors around the globe
  are starting to look at the genes or the whole genome and how that sequence is different
  from a healthy / well responding individual. . SOAPsnp is a member of the SOAP (Short
  Oligonucleotide Analysis Package). The program is a resequencing utility. It assembles
  the consensus sequence for the genome of a newly sequenced individual based on the
  alignment of the raw sequencing reads on a known reference. SNPs can then be identified
  on the consensus sequence through the comparison with the reference. . SOAPsnp uses
  a method based on Bayes' theorem (the reverse probability model) to call consensus
  genotype by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and recurring experimental
  errors. All these kinds of information was integrated into a single quality score
  for each base in PHRED scale to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. Currently,
  it supports the alignment format of SOAPaligner (soap2).
