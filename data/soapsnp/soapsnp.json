One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 363coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97% and 99.84% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth. \u00a9 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 634, "authors": [{"name": "Li R."}, {"name": "Li Y."}, {"name": "Fang X."}, {"name": "Yang H."}, {"name": "Wang J."}, {"name": "Kristiansen K."}, {"name": "Wang J."}], "date": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "SOAP Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "soap@genomics.org.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:soapsnp", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapsnp.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Variant calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3227"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Accurate consensus sequence builder based on soap1 and SOAPaligner/soap2's alignment output.
