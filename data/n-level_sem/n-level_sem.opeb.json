In the context of randomized controlled trials, students are nested in classrooms but may be cross-classified by other units, such as small groups. Furthermore, in many cases only some students may be nested within a unit while other students may not. Such instances of partial nesting requires a more flexible framework for estimating treatment effects so that the model coefficients are correctly estimated.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SEM' (bio.tools/sem), 'xxm', 'n-level', 'cross-classified'","homepage":"https://qmi-fcrr.shinyapps.io/nSEM","name":"n-level SEM"}}
