The Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections (BHAI) is estimated in disability-adjusted life years, number of infections as well as number of deaths per year. Results can be visualized with various plotting functions and exported into tables.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HAI', 'burden healthcare-associated infections', 'HAIs DALYs', 'DALYs'","homepage":"https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BHAI","name":"burden HAIs"}}
