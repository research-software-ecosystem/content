    "description": "Application of a new methodology and R package reveals a high burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in Germany compared to the average in the European Union/European Economic Area, 2011 to 2012.\n\nEstimate the Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections.\n\nProvides an approach which is based on the methodology of the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe (BCoDE) and can be used for large and small samples such as individual countries. The Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections (BHAI) is estimated in disability-adjusted life years, number of infections as well as number of deaths per year. Results can be visualized with various plotting functions and exported into tables.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HAI', 'burden healthcare-associated infections', 'HAIs DALYs', 'DALYs'",
