For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.MOTIVATION: Microscopy images of stained cells and tissues play a central role in most biomedical experiments and routine histopathology. Storing colour histological images digitally opens the possibility to process numerically colour distribution and intensity to extract quantitative data. Among those numerical procedures are colour deconvolution, which enable decomposing an RGB image into channels representing the optical absorbance and transmittance of the dyes when their RGB representation is known. Consequently, a range of new applications become possible for morphological and histochemical segmentation, automated marker localization and image enhancement. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Colour deconvolution is presented here in two open-source forms: a MATLAB program/function and an ImageJ plugin written in Java. Both versions run in Windows, Macintosh and UNIX-based systems under the respective platforms.
