Except for a limited number of tissues with known pure cell type profiles, a majority of genomics and epigenetics data relies on the \"reference-free deconvolution\" methods to estimate cell composition. We develop a novel computational method to improve reference-free deconvolution, which iteratively searches for cell type-specific features and performs composition estimation. Simulation studies and applications to six real datasets including both DNA methylation and gene expression data demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed method.
