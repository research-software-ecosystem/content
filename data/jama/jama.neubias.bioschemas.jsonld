  "http://schema.org/description": "<blockquote>\r\n<p>JAMA is a basic linear algebra package for Java. It provides user-level classes for constructing and manipulating real, dense matrices. It is meant to provide sufficient functionality for routine problems, packaged in a way that is natural and understandable to non-experts. It is intended to serve as&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;standard matrix class for Java, and will be proposed as such to the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?timeout=5&amp;url=http://www.npac.syr.edu/javagrande/\">Java Grande Forum</a>&nbsp;and then to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/cgi-bin/exit_nist.cgi?timeout=5&amp;url=http://java.sun.com/\">Sun</a>. A straightforward public-domain reference implementation has been developed by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mathworks.com/\">MathWorks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/\">NIST</a>&nbsp;as a strawman for such a class. We are releasing this version in order to obtain public comment. There is no guarantee that future versions of JAMA will be compatible with this one.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n",
