Results To illustrate the effects of “noise”, we present simulated datasets following closely the characteristics of a H.sapiens and a M.musculus dataset, respectively, highlighting the extent of technical-noise in both a high inter-individual variability ( H. sapiens ) and reduced variability ( M. Musculus ) setup.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'noise_detection', 'Noise-adjustment', 'read-processing', 'noise-thresholds'","homepage":"https://github.com/yry/noiseAnalysis/tree/master/noiseDetection_mRNA","name":"noiseDetection_mRNA"}}
