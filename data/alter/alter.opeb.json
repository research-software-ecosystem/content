The originality of ALTER lies in the fact that it focuses on the specifications of mainstream alignment and analysis programs rather than on the conversion among more or less specific formats. In addition, ALTER is capable of identify and remove identical sequences during the transformation process. Besides its user-friendly environment, ALTER allows access to its functionalities in a programmatic way through a Representational State Transfer web service. ALTER's front-end and its API are freely available at http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/ALTER/ and http://sing.ei.uvigo.es/ALTER/api/, respectively. © The Author(s) 2010.
