All rights reserved.Background: Healthcare-associated infections(HAIs) pose a major challenge to health systems. Burden of disease estimations in disability-adjusted life years(DALYs) are useful for comparing and ranking HAIs. Aim: To estimate the number of five common HAIs, their attributable number of deaths and burden for Germany. Methods: We developed a new method and R package that builds on the approach used by the Burden of Communicable Diseases in Europe(BCoDE) project to estimate the burden of HAIs for individual countries. We used data on healthcare-associatedClostridioidesdifficileinfection,healthcareassociated pneumonia, healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infection, healthcare-associated urinary tract infection and surgical-site infection, which were collected during the point prevalence survey of HAIs in European acute-care hospitals between 2011 and 2012. Results: We estimated 478,222(95%uncertainty interval(UI):421,350\u2013537,787) cases for Germany, resulting in 16,245(95%UI:10,863\u201322,756) attributable deaths and 248,920(95%UI:178,693\u2013336,239)DALYs. Despite the fact that Germany has a relatively low hospital prevalence of HAIs compared with the European Union/European Economic Area(EU/EEA) average, the burden of HAIs in Germany(308.2DALYs/100,000 population; 95%UI:221.2\u2013416.3) was higher than the EU/EEA average(290.0DALYs/100,000 population; 95%UI:214.9\u2013376.9). Our methodology is applicable to other countries in or outside of the EU/EEA. An R package is available from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=BHAI. Conclusion: This is the first study to estimate the burden of HAIs in DALYs for Germany. The large number of hospital beds may be a contributing factor for a relatively high burden of HAIs in Germany. Further focus on infection prevention control, paired with reduction of avoidable hospital stays, is needed to reduce the burden of HAIs in Germany.",
