It allows the user to create personal data sets of interactions by combining information from private and public data sources. The user can gradually access the interactions' data using a clear interactive map that is focused on the researcher's protein of interest, and is reshaped and expanded in response to his/her queries. It also offers several visual enhancements and intelligent queries that help the user efficiently study it. PIVOT allows the user to search the interactions data set for paths connecting proteins that are expected to co-operate. The user can also employ PIVOT to predict unknown interactions among proteins, based on interactions among their homologous proteins in other species. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; All rights reserved.", "citationCount": 23, "authors": [{"name": "Orlev N."}, {"name": "Shamir R."}, {"name": "Shiloh Y."}], "date": "2004-02-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/pivot/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pivot", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/pivot/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Protein Interactions VisualizatiOn Tool is a Java-based tool, for visualizing protein-protein interactions.
