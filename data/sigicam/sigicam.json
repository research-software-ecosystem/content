    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'patient-bed', 'technological', 'Atacama' | A New Software to Improve the Patient Care Supported by a Constraint-Based Model | Health facilities are care centers that receive patients with different requirements. The management of patients falls to the clinical staff trained for this activity. However, given the demands of the population, the task of managing beds is sometimes too complicated when carried out manually. In this work, we propose the design and implementation of a technological platform that provides an improved optimization approach. It manages the patient-bed allocation efficiently, by considering hospital resources given the number of units and patient diagnosis. This tool was deployed in hospitals of the Atacama regional health service in Chile, boosting the work of the clinical staff of the health facility",
