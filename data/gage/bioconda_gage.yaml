description: GAGE is a published method for gene set (enrichment or GSEA) or pathway
  analysis. GAGE is generally applicable independent of microarray or RNA-Seq data
  attributes including sample sizes, experimental designs, assay platforms, and other
  types of heterogeneity, and consistently achieves superior performance over other
  frequently used methods. In gage package, we provide functions for basic GAGE analysis,
  result processing and presentation. We have also built pipeline routines for of
  multiple GAGE analyses in a batch, comparison between parallel analyses, and combined
  analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources/studies. In addition, we provide
  demo microarray data and commonly used gene set data based on KEGG pathways and
  GO terms. These funtions and data are also useful for gene set analysis using other
  methods.
