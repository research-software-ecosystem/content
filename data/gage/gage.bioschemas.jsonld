It is generally applicable independent of microarray or RNA-Seq data attributes and consistently achieves superior performance over other frequently used methods. We provide functions for basic analysis, result processing and presentation. We have also built pipeline routines for of multiple analyses in a batch, comparison between parallel analyses, and combined analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources/studies.",
