Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Complete 3’UTRs unambiguously assigned to specific mRNA isoforms from the Atlantic salmon full‐length (FL) transcriptome were collected into a 3’UTRome. miRNA response elements (MREs) and other cis‐regulatory motifs were subsequently predicted and assigned to 3’UTRs of all FL‐transcripts. The MicroSalmon GitHub repository provides all results. RNAHybrid and sRNAtoolbox tools predicted the MREs. UTRscan and the Teiresias algorithm predicted other 3’UTR cisacting motifs, both known vertebrate motifs and putative novel motifs. MicroSalmon provides search programs to retrieve all FL‐transcripts targeted by a miRNA (median number 1487), all miR‐ NAs targeting an FL‐transcript (median number 27), and other cis‐acting motifs. As thousands of FL‐transcripts may be targets of each miRNA, additional experimental strategies are necessary to reduce the likely true and relevant targets to a number that may be functionally validated. Lowcomplexity motifs known to affect mRNA decay in vertebrates were over‐represented. Many of these were enriched in the terminal end, while purine‐ or pyrimidine‐rich motifs with unknown functions were enriched immediately downstream of the stop codon. Furthermore, several novel complex motifs were over‐represented, indicating conservation and putative function. In conclusion, MicroSalmon is an extensive and useful, searchable resource for study of Atlantic salmon transcript regulation by miRNAs and cis‐acting 3’UTR motifs.",
