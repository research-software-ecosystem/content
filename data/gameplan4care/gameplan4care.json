    "description": "AN ONLINE TRANSLATION OF REACH II REFINED THROUGH EARLY STAKEHOLDER USABILITY TESTING.\n\nAbstractDespite a number of evidences on the implementation of multicomponent education and support programs to improve the lives of dementia caregivers, there is still a need to adapt these interventions to various implementation settings and preferences of a new generation of caregivers. In this study, we present the development and usability testing of a dementia caregiver support program, GamePlan4Care (GP4C), an online translation of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer\u2019s Caregiver Health II (REACH II) intervention. The goal of the GP4C is to create an online family caregiver support system that would facilitate delivery of an evidence-based skills-training and support for dementia caregivers with the potential of both scalability and sustainability.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GP4C', 'dementia caregivers', 'caregivers', 'caregiver'",
