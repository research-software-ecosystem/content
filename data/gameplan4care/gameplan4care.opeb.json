In this study, we present the development and usability testing of a dementia caregiver support program, GamePlan4Care (GP4C), an online translation of the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health II (REACH II) intervention. The goal of the GP4C is to create an online family caregiver support system that would facilitate delivery of an evidence-based skills-training and support for dementia caregivers with the potential of both scalability and sustainability.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GP4C', 'dementia caregivers', 'caregivers', 'caregiver'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6846234/","name":"GamePlan4Care"}}
