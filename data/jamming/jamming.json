Here we present a new algorithm based on network analysis applied exclusively on protein structures to identify critical residues. Our results show that this method identifies critical residues for protein function with high reliability and improves automatic sequence-based approaches and previous network-based approaches. The reliability of the method depends on the conformational diversity screened for the protein of interest. We have designed a web site to give access to this software at http://bis.ifc.unam.mx/jamming/. In summary, a new method is presented that relates critical residues for protein function with the most traversed residues in networks derived from protein structures. A unique feature of the method is the inclusion of the conformational diversity of proteins in the prediction, thus reproducing a basic feature of the structure/function relationship of proteins. \u00a9 2007 Cusack et al.", "citationCount": 22, "authors": [{"name": "Cusack M.P."}, {"name": "Thibert B."}, {"name": "Bredesen D.E."}, {"name": "del Rio G."}], "date": "2007-05-09T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bis.ifc.unam.mx/en", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:jamming", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bis.ifc.unam.mx:8090/JAMMING/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "JAMMING is a software for prediction of critical residues for protein function based only on the 3D structure of proteins", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/jamming-java-based-multi-threaded-minimum-interacting-networks-gui.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "jamming", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:07:57Z", "name": "JAMMING", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://132.248.16.230:8090/JAMMING/QuickTour/index.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
