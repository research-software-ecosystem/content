Published by Oxford University Press. Summary: Biologists produce large data sets and are in demand of rich and simple web portals in which they can upload and analyze their files. Providing such tools requires to mask the complexity induced by the needed High Performance Computing (HPC) environment. The connection between interface and computing infrastructure is usually specific to each portal. With Jflow, we introduce a Workflow Management System (WMS), composed of jQuery plug-ins which can easily be embedded in any web application and a Python library providing all requested features to setup, run and monitor workflows.","authors":["Mariette J.","Escudie F.","Bardou P.","Nabihoudine I.","Noirot C.","Trotard M.-S.","Gaspin C.","Klopp C."],"cit_count":0,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26454273","title":"Jflow: A workflow management system for web applications","year":"2015-04-23"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:jflow","biotoolsID":"jflow","description":"JavaScript based workflow management system, composed of Jquery plugins which can easily be embedded in any WEB application and a Python library providing all requested features to setup, run and monitor workflows.","homepage":"http://jflow.toulouse.inra.fr/app/index.html","name":"Jflow"}}
