It also can reliably identify barcodes and assign the reads to the original samples. Based on a modified Myers's bit-vector dynamic programming algorithm, Btrim can handle indels in adapters and barcodes. It removes low quality regions and trims off adapters at both or either end of the reads. A typical trimming of 30. M reads with two sets of adapter pairs can be done in about a minute with a small memory footprint. Btrim is a versatile stand-alone tool that can be used as the first step in virtually all next-generation sequence analysis pipelines. The program is available at http://graphics.med.yale.edu/trim/. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "citationCount": 179, "authors": [{"name": "Kong Y."}], "date": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yong Kong", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yong.kong@yale.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:btrim", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://graphics.med.yale.edu/trim/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence trimming", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3192"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast and lightweight software to trim adapters and low quality regions in reads.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "btrim", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:13:55Z", "name": "Btrim", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://graphics.med.yale.edu/trim/readme", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
