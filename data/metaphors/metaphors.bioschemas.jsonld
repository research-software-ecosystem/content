Currently, over 6.8 billion unique homologs are deposited in this database. These predictions were retrieved from 7 million Maximum Likelihood trees for 2,714 species. For each prediction, it provides a Consistency Score and Evidence Level describing its goodness, together with number of trees and links to their source databases.",
