These new non-Sanger-based technologies feature several advantages when compared with traditional sequencing methods in terms of higher sequencing speed, lower per run cost and higher accuracy. However, reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms, such as 454/Roche, ABI/SOLiD and Illumina/Solexa, are usually short, thereby restricting the applications of NGS platforms in genome assembly and annotation. We presented an overview of the challenges that these novel technologies meet and particularly illustrated various bioinformatics attempts on mapping and assembly for problem solving. We then compared the performance of several programs in these two fields, and further provided advices on selecting suitable tools for specific biological applications. \u00a9 2011 The Japan Society of Human Genetics All rights reserved.", "citationCount": 88, "authors": [{"name": "Bao S."}, {"name": "Jiang R."}, {"name": "Kwan W."}, {"name": "Wang B."}, {"name": "Ma X."}, {"name": "Song Y.-Q."}], "date": "2011-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Human Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Nils Homer", "url": "https://sourceforge.net/u/nilshomer/profile/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dnaa", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/dnaa/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequencing quality control", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3218"}, {"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}, {"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Software for analysis of Next-Generation Sequencing data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "dnaa", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:14:21Z", "name": "DNAA", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://sourceforge.net/p/dnaa/wiki/Home/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
