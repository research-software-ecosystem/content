  "http://schema.org/description": "OMERO.figure is an OMERO web application that makes generating figures from images in an OMERO image database very quick and easy. The images in the figure link back to the original data, greatly simplifying the process of adjusting the view and keeping track of original data. PDF documents are generated, which can be opened using e.g. Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape in order to produce the final finished figure.\r\n",
