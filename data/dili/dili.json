    "description": "Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) With Micafungin.\n\nBackground: Micafungin is increasingly used in the treatment and prevention of candidiasis in hospitalized patients. Limited data are available from which to assess the risk of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) with micafungin. No studies, to date, have applied a standardized causality assessment method to the study of micafungin-associated DILI. Objective: This study aimed to identify the frequency and clinical pattern of DILI in micafungin-treated patients as determined using 2 standardized causality assessment algorithms. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted of micafungin-treated patients at a single center between May 15, 2017, and May 15, 2018. DILI was defined on the basis of liver test elevations and the presence of associated signs and symptoms. The Roussel UClaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) and the Naranjo algorithm were applied to each case.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
