To effectively and timely use such a tool, however, the first important thing is to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately identifying the signal peptide for a given nascent protein. With the avalanche of new protein sequences generated in the post-genomic era, the challenge has become even more urgent and critical. In this paper, we have developed a novel method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in human, plant, animal, eukaryotic, Gram-positive, and Gram-negative protein sequences, respectively. The new predictor is called Signal-3L that consists of three prediction engines working, respectively, for the following three progressively deepening layers: (1) identifying a query protein as secretory or non-secretory by an ensemble classifier formed by fusing many individual OET-KNN (optimized evidence-theoretic K nearest neighbor) classifiers operated in various dimensions of PseAA (pseudo amino acid) composition spaces; (2) selecting a set of candidates for the possible signal peptide cleavage sites of a query secretory protein by a subsite-coupled discrimination algorithm; (3) determining the final cleavage site by fusing the global sequence alignment outcome for each of the aforementioned candidates through a voting system. Signal-3L is featured by high success prediction rates with short computational time, and hence is particularly useful for the analysis of large-scale datasets. Signal-3L is freely available as a web-server at http://chou.med.harvard.edu/bioinf/Signal-3L/ or http://202.120.37.186/bioinf/Signal-3L, where, to further support the demand of the related areas, the signal peptides identified by Signal-3L for all the protein entries in Swiss-Prot databank that do not have signal peptide annotations or are annotated with uncertain terms but are classified by Signal-3L as secretory proteins are provided in a downloadable file. The large-scale file is prepared with Microsoft Excel and named \"Tab-Signal-3L.xls\", and will be updated once a year to include new protein entries and reflect the continuous development of Signal-3L.", "citationCount": 245, "authors": [{"name": "Shen H.-B."}, {"name": "Chou K.-C."}], "date": "2007-11-16T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hbshen@sjtu.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:signal-3l", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/Signal-3L/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein signal peptide detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0418"}, {"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Automated method for predicting signal peptide sequences and their cleavage sites in eukaryotic and bacterial protein sequences.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/signal-3l-a-3-layer-approach-for-predicting-signal-peptides.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "signal-3l", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:01:29Z", "name": "Signal-3L", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/Signal-3L/Signal3LReadme.htm", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
