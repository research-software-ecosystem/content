The discovery of such variation may help to identify causative gene mutations in monogenic diseases and SNPs associated with predisposing genes in complex diseases. Accurate detection of SNPs requires software that can correctly interpret chromatogram signals to nucleotides. Results: We present VarDetect, a stand-alone nucleotide variation exploratory tool that automatically detects nucleotide variation from fluorescence based chromatogram traces. Accurate SNP base-calling is achieved using pre-calculated peak content ratios, and is enhanced by rules which account for common sequence reading artifacts. The proposed software tool is benchmarked against four other well-known SNP discovery software tools (PolyPhred, novoSNP, Genalys and Mutation Surveyor) using fluorescence based chromatograms from 15 human genes. These chromatograms were obtained from sequencing 16 two-pooled DNA samples; a total of 32 individual DNA samples. In this comparison of automatic SNP detection tools, VarDetect achieved the highest detection efficiency. © 2008 Ngamphiw et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Ngamphiw C.","Kulawonganunchai S.","Assawamakin A.","Jenwitheesuk E.","Tongsima S."],"cit_count":15,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pmid":"19091032","title":"VarDetect: A nucleotide sequence variation exploratory tool","year":"2008-12-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vardetect","biotoolsID":"vardetect","description":"A stand-alone nucleotide variation exploratory tool that automatically detects nucleotide variation from fluorescence based chromatogram traces.","homepage":"http://www4a.biotec.or.th/GI/tools/vardetect","name":"VarDetect"}}
