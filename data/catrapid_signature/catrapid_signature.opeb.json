Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Recent technological advances revealed that an unexpected large number of proteins interact with transcripts even if the RNA-binding domains are not annotated. We introduce catRAPID signature to identify ribonucleoproteins based on physico-chemical features instead of sequence similarity searches. The algorithm, trained on human proteins and tested on model organisms, calculates the overall RNA-binding propensity followed by the prediction of RNA-binding regions. catRAPID signature outperforms other algorithms in the identification of RNA-binding proteins and detection of non-classical RNA-binding regions. Results are visualized on a webpage and can be downloaded or forwarded to catRAPID omics for predictions of RNA targets.","authors":["Livi C.M.","Klus P.","Delli Ponti R.","Tartaglia G.G."],"cit_count":17,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26520853","title":"CatRAPID signature: Identification of ribonucleoproteins and RNA-binding regions","year":"2015-05-08"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:catrapid_signature","biotoolsID":"catrapid_signature","description":"This software calculates the overall RNA-binding propensity followed by the prediction of RNA-binding regions","homepage":"http://s.tartaglialab.com/new_submission/signature","name":"catRAPID signature"}}
