  description: GRO-seq Analysis Pipeline
  long_description: " This BioConductor package provides a pipeline for the analysis
    of GRO-\n seq data. Among the more advanced features, r-bioc-grohmm predicts the\n
    boundaries of transcriptional activity across the genome de novo using a\n two-state
    hidden Markov model (HMM).\n .\n The used model essentially divides the genome
    into transcribed and non-\n transcribed regions in a strand specific manner. HMMs
    are used to\n identify the leading edge of Pol II at genes activated by a stimulus
    in\n GRO-seq time course data. This approach allows the genome-wide\n interrogation
    of transcription rates in cells.\n"
