description: Starr facilitates the analysis of ChIP-chip data, in particular that
  of Affymetrix tiling arrays. The package provides functions for data import, quality
  assessment, data visualization and exploration. Furthermore, it includes high-level
  analysis features like association of ChIP signals with annotated features, correlation
  analysis of ChIP signals and other genomic data (e.g. gene expression), peak-finding
  with the CMARRT algorithm and comparative display of multiple clusters of ChIP-profiles.
  It uses the basic Bioconductor classes ExpressionSet and probeAnno for maximum compatibility
  with other software on Bioconductor. All functions from Starr can be used to investigate
  preprocessed data from the Ringo package, and vice versa. An important novel tool
  is the the automated generation of correct, up-to-date microarray probe annotation
  (bpmap) files, which relies on an efficient mapping of short sequences (e.g. the
  probe sequences on a microarray) to an arbitrary genome.
