Such analytical capacity is of great interest to many research groups in the world, yet these groups often lack the expertise to handle complex scRNA-seq datasets. Results We developed a fully integrated, web-based platform aimed at the complete analysis of scRNA-seq data post genome alignment: From the parsing, filtering and normalization of the input count data files, to the visual representation of the data, identification of cell clusters, differentially expressed genes (including cluster-specific marker genes), and functional gene set enrichment. This Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline (ASAP) combines a wide range of commonly used algorithms with sophisticated visualization tools. Compared with existing scRNA-seq analysis platforms, researchers (including those lacking computational expertise) are able to interact with the data in a straightforward fashion and in real time. Furthermore, given the overlap between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq analysis workflows, ASAP should conceptually be broadly applicable to any RNA-seq dataset. As a validation, we demonstrate how we can use ASAP to simply reproduce the results from a single-cell study of 91 mouse cells involving five distinct cell types.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Gardeux V."}, {"name": "David F.P.A."}, {"name": "Shajkofci A."}, {"name": "Schwalie P.C."}, {"name": "Deplancke B."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Bart Deplancke", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bart.deplancke@epfl.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:asap_pipeline", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/DeplanckeLab/ASAP", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0564"}, {"term": "RNA-Seq analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3680"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Automated Single-cell Analysis Pipeline.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "asap_pipeline", "additionDate": "2018-06-11T17:49:38Z", "name": "ASAP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/DeplanckeLab/ASAP", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
