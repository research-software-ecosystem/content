Published by Oxford University Press.MOTIVATION: Protein essentiality is usually accepted to be a conditional trait and strongly affected by cellular environments. However, existing computational methods often do not take such characteristics into account, preferring to incorporate all available data and train a general model for all cell lines. In addition, the lack of model interpretability limits further exploration and analysis of essential protein predictions. RESULTS: In this study, we proposed DeepCellEss, a sequence-based interpretable deep learning framework for cell line-specific essential protein predictions. DeepCellEss utilizes a convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory to learn short- and long-range latent information from protein sequences. Further, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is used to provide residue-level model interpretability. For model construction, we collected extremely large-scale benchmark datasets across 323 cell lines. Extensive computational experiments demonstrate that DeepCellEss yields effective prediction performance for different cell lines and outperforms existing sequence-based methods as well as network-based centrality measures. Finally, we conducted some case studies to illustrate the necessity of considering specific cell lines and the superiority of DeepCellEss. We believe that DeepCellEss can serve as a useful tool for predicting essential proteins across different cell lines.
