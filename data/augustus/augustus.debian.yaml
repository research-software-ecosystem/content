description: AUGUSTUS is a software for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences
  that is based on a generalized hidden Markov model (HMM), a probabilistic model
  of a sequence and its gene structure. After learning gene structures from a reference
  annotation, AUGUSTUS uses the HMM to recognize genes in a new sequence and annotates
  it with the regions of identified genes. External hints, e.g. from RNA sequencing,
  EST or protein alignments etc. can be used to guide and improve the gene finding
  process. The result is the set of most likely gene structures that comply with all
  given user constraints, if such gene structures exist. AUGUSTUS already includes
  prebuilt HMMs for many species, as well as scripts to train custom models using
  annotated genomes.
