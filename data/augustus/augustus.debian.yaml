description: "AUGUSTUS is a software for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences\
  \ that is based on a generalized hidden Markov model (HMM), a probabilistic model\
  \ of a sequence and its gene structure. After learning gene structures from a reference\
  \ annotation, AUGUSTUS uses the HMM to recognize genes in a new sequence and annotates\
  \ it with the regions of identified genes. External hints, e.g. from RNA sequencing,\
  \ EST or protein alignments etc. can be used to guide and improve the gene finding\
  \ process. The result is the set of most likely gene structures that comply with\
  \ all given user constraints, if such gene structures exist. AUGUSTUS already includes\
  \ prebuilt HMMs for many species, as well as scripts to train custom models using\
  \ annotated genomes.\n"
