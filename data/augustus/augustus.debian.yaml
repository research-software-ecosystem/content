summary: gene prediction in eukaryotic genomes
description: >
   AUGUSTUS is a software for gene prediction in eukaryotic genomic sequences
   that is based on a generalized hidden Markov model (HMM), a probabilistic
   model of a sequence and its gene structure. After learning gene structures
   from a reference annotation, AUGUSTUS uses the HMM to recognize genes in a new
   sequence and annotates it with the regions of identified genes. External hints,
   e.g. from RNA sequencing, EST or protein alignments etc. can be used to guide
   and improve the gene finding process. The result is the set of most likely gene
   structures that comply with all given user constraints, if such gene
   structures exist.
   AUGUSTUS already includes prebuilt HMMs for many species, as well as scripts
   to train custom models using annotated genomes.
