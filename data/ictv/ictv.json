This article lists the changes to virus taxonomy approved and ratified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in April 2016. Changes to virus taxonomy (the Universal Scheme of Virus Classification of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [ICTV]) now take place annually and are the result of a multi-stage process. In accordance with the ICTV Statutes (http://www.ictvonline.org/statutes.asp), proposals submitted to the ICTV Executive Committee (EC) undergo a review process that involves input from the ICTV Study Groups (SGs) and Subcommittees (SCs), other interested virologists, and the EC. After final approval by the EC, proposals are then presented for ratification to the full ICTV membership by publication on an ICTV web site (http://www.ictvonline.org/) followed by an electronic vote. The latest set of proposals approved by the EC was made available on the ICTV website by January 2016 (https://talk.ictvonline.org/files/proposals/). A list of these proposals was then emailed on 28 March 2016 to the 148 members of ICTV, namely the EC Members, Life Members, ICTV Subcommittee Members (including the SG chairs) and ICTV National Representatives. Members were then requested to vote on whether to ratify the taxonomic proposals (voting closed on 29 April 2016).", "citationCount": 81, "authors": [{"name": "Adams M.J."}, {"name": "Lefkowitz E.J."}, {"name": "King A.M.Q."}, {"name": "Harrach B."}, {"name": "Harrison R.L."}, {"name": "Knowles N.J."}, {"name": "Kropinski A.M."}, {"name": "Krupovic M."}, {"name": "Kuhn J.H."}, {"name": "Mushegian A.R."}, {"name": "Nibert M."}, {"name": "Sabanadzovic S."}, {"name": "Sanfacon H."}, {"name": "Siddell S.G."}, {"name": "Simmonds P."}, {"name": "Varsani A."}, {"name": "Zerbini F.M."}, {"name": "Gorbalenya A.E."}, {"name": "Davison A.J."}], "date": "2016-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Archives of Virology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "rki.de", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "info@ictvonline.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ictv", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ictvonline.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "Taxonomic classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3460"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Committee for developing, refining, and maintaining a universal virus taxonomy.
