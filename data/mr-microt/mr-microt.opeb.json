Computational methods that predict which genes are targeted by particular miRNA molecules are known as target prediction methods. In this paper, we present a MapReduce-based system, termed MR-microT, for one of the most popular and accurate, but computational intensive, prediction methods. MR-microT offers the highly requested by life scientists feature of predicting the targets of ad-hoc miRNA molecules in near-real time through an intuitive Web interface. © Copyright 2014 ACM 978-1-4503-2722-0/14/06⋯$15. 00.","authors":["Kanellos I.","Vergoulis T.","Sacharidis D.","Dalamagas T.","Hatzigeorgiou A.","Sartzetakis S.","Sellis T."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1145/2618243.2618289","journal":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","title":"MR-microT: A MapReduce-based MicroRNA target prediction method","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mr-microt","biotoolsID":"mr-microt","description":"A MapReduce-based implementation of microT target prediction method.
