In spite of the importance of quality assessment of experimentally determined PPIs, a surprisingly small number of databases provide interactions with scores and confidence levels. We introduce HitPredict (http:// hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/), a database with qualityassessed PPIs in nine species. HitPredict assigns a confidence level to interactions based on a reliability score that is computed using evidence from sequence, structure and functional annotations of the interacting proteins. HitPredict was first released in 2005 and is updated annually. The current release contains 36 930 proteins with 176 983 non-redundant, physical interactions, of which 116 198 (66%) are predicted to be of high confidence. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 61, "authors": [{"name": "Patil A."}, {"name": "Nakai K."}, {"name": "Nakamura H."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "HitPredict Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ashwini@hgc.jp"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hitpredict", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://hintdb.hgc.jp/htp/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3439"}, {"term": "Pathway or network comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0277"}, {"term": "Protein interaction analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2949"}, {"term": "Protein-protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2464"}, {"term": "Protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "HitPredict is a database with quality assessed PPIs in nine species.
