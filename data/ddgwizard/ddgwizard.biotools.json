    "description": "DDGWizard is a ∆∆G analysis system, which includes a feature calculation pipeline that integrates 12 computational resources and is capable\nof automatically calculating 1,547 features for ∆∆G data. The calculated features provide information for the ∆∆G prediction from various perspectives, including the structure and environment of wild-type proteins, structural and environmental changes before and after mutation, mutation types, and evolutionary information. In addition, it provides a feature enriched dataset created using the pipeline, including 15,752 ∆∆G data. Furthermore, it incorporates an accurate ∆∆G prediction model developed with the selected optimal features. The model achieved an R-squared of 0.61 in cross-validation.",
