To examine the evolutionary history of green plants in a phylogenomic framework, the 1KP project sequenced over 1000 transcriptomes across the Viridiplantae. The 1KP project provided a unique opportunity to study the distribution and occurrence of WGDs across the green plants. In the 1KP capstone analyses, we used a total evidence approach that combined inferences of WGDs from Ks and phylogenomic methods to infer and place ancient WGDs. Overall, 244 putative ancient WGDs were inferred across the Viridiplantae. Here, we describe these analyses and evaluate the consistency of the WGD inferences by comparing them to evidence from published syntenic analyses of plant genome assemblies","homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/barkerlab/1kp/src/master/","name":"1KP"}}
