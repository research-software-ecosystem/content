description: GSCA takes as input several lists of activated and repressed genes. GSCA
  then searches through a compendium of publicly available gene expression profiles
  for biological contexts that are enriched with a specified pattern of gene expression.
  GSCA provides both traditional R functions and interactive, user-friendly user interface.
