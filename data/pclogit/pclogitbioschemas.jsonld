  "sc:description": "R package for penalized conditional/unconditional logistic regression using a network-based peanlty for matched/unmatched case-control data with grouped or graph-constrained variables. The algorithm is efficient for fitting the regularization path and for providing selection probabilities of each predictor for the anaylsis of high-dimensional matched/unmatched case-control data. It uses cyclical coordinate descent in a pathwise fashion.",
