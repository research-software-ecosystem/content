description: Islandpath-dimob is a standalone software to predict genomic islands
  in bacterial and archaeal genomes based on the presence of dinucleotide biases and
  mobility genes.\n\ngenomic islands (gis) are clusters of genes in prokaryotic genomes
  of probable horizontal origin. gis are disproportionately associated with microbial
  adaptations of medical or environmental interest.
