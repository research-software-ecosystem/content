Various protocols to investigate genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic features across virtually all species and tissues have been devised. For most of these experiments, one of the first crucial steps of bioinformatic analysis is the mapping of reads to reference genomes. Results: Here, we present thorough benchmarks of our read aligner segemehl in comparison with other state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce the tool lack to rescue unmapped RNA-seq reads which works in conjunction with segemehl and many other frequently used split-read aligners. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Otto C.","Stadler P.F.","Hoffmann S."],"cit_count":25,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu146","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24626854","title":"Lacking alignments?
