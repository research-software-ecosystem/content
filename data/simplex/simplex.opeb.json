Individual-based models (IBM) allow ecological patterns and dynamics to be studied as they emerge from the individual level according to simulated principles and theories. IBMs also allow virtually any aspect of a simulated system to be tracked and recorded for later analysis. I developed a novel IBM platform (i.e, simplex) to explicitly simulate physiology, life history, resource-limited growth, fluctuating environmental dynamics, and community assembly and structure in both fluid and non-fluid environments. simplex accomplishes three primary tasks in keeping with its namesake (i.e., a generalized notion of a triangle to arbitrary dimensions). First, simplex assembles and runs stochastic ecological models from random combinations of over 20 state variables.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.1469V2","name":"simplex"}}
