The formation of \u03b2-turns plays an important role in protein folding, protein stability and molecular recognition processes. In this work we present the neural network method NetTurnP, for prediction of two-class \u03b2-turns and prediction of the individual \u03b2-turn types, by use of evolutionary information and predicted protein sequence features. It has been evaluated against a commonly used dataset BT426, and achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.50, which is the highest reported performance on a two-class prediction of \u03b2-turn and not-\u03b2-turn. Furthermore NetTurnP shows improved performance on some of the specific \u03b2-turn types. In the present work, neural network methods have been trained to predict \u03b2-turn or not and individual \u03b2-turn types from the primary amino acid sequence. The individual \u03b2-turn types I, I', II, II', VIII, VIa1, VIa2, VIba and IV have been predicted based on classifications by PROMOTIF, and the two-class prediction of \u03b2-turn or not is a superset comprised of all \u03b2-turn types. The performance is evaluated using a golden set of non-homologous sequences known as BT426. Our two-class prediction method achieves a performance of: MCC = 0.50, Qtotal = 82.1%, sensitivity = 75.6%, PPV = 68.8% and AUC = 0.864. We have compared our performance to eleven other prediction methods that obtain Matthews correlation coefficients in the range of 0.17 - 0.47. For the type specific \u03b2-turn predictions, only type I and II can be predicted with reasonable Matthews correlation coefficients, where we obtain performance values of 0.36 and 0.31, respectively. Conclusion: The NetTurnP method has been implemented as a webserver, which is freely available at http://www.cbs.dtu. dk/services/NetTurnP/. NetTurnP is the only available webserver that allows submission of multiple sequences. \u00a9 2010 Petersen et al.", "citationCount": 47, "authors": [{"name": "Petersen B."}, {"name": "Lundegaard C."}, {"name": "Petersen T.N."}], "date": "2010-12-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "CBS", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Bent Petersen", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bent@cbs.dtu.dk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:netturnp", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/", "function": [{"note": "predicts whether an amino acid is located in a Beta-turn or not;predicts the nine Beta-turn subtypes", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Structure report", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2085"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Prediction whether an amino acid is located in a Beta-turn or not.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://cbs.dtu.dk/services", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "netturnp", "additionDate": "2015-01-21T13:29:20Z", "name": "NetTurnP", "license": "Other", "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/instructions.php", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
