The formation of β-turns plays an important role in protein folding, protein stability and molecular recognition processes. In this work we present the neural network method NetTurnP, for prediction of two-class β-turns and prediction of the individual β-turn types, by use of evolutionary information and predicted protein sequence features. It has been evaluated against a commonly used dataset BT426, and achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.50, which is the highest reported performance on a two-class prediction of β-turn and not-β-turn. Furthermore NetTurnP shows improved performance on some of the specific β-turn types. In the present work, neural network methods have been trained to predict β-turn or not and individual β-turn types from the primary amino acid sequence. The individual β-turn types I, I', II, II', VIII, VIa1, VIa2, VIba and IV have been predicted based on classifications by PROMOTIF, and the two-class prediction of β-turn or not is a superset comprised of all β-turn types. The performance is evaluated using a golden set of non-homologous sequences known as BT426. Our two-class prediction method achieves a performance of: MCC = 0.50, Qtotal = 82.1%, sensitivity = 75.6%, PPV = 68.8% and AUC = 0.864. We have compared our performance to eleven other prediction methods that obtain Matthews correlation coefficients in the range of 0.17 - 0.47. For the type specific β-turn predictions, only type I and II can be predicted with reasonable Matthews correlation coefficients, where we obtain performance values of 0.36 and 0.31, respectively. Conclusion: The NetTurnP method has been implemented as a webserver, which is freely available at http://www.cbs.dtu. dk/services/NetTurnP/. NetTurnP is the only available webserver that allows submission of multiple sequences. © 2010 Petersen et al.","authors":["Petersen B.","Lundegaard C.","Petersen T.N."],"cit_count":47,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0015079","journal":"PLoS ONE","title":"NetTurnP - neural network prediction of beta-turns by use of evolutionary information and predicted protein sequence features","type":"Primary","year":"2010-12-10"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:netturnp","biotoolsID":"netturnp","description":"Prediction whether an amino acid is located in a Beta-turn or not.","homepage":"http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetTurnP/","name":"NetTurnP","version":["1.0"]}}
