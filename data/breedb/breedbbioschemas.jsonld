The database can be explored through a web-based interface, which offers tools to present basic statistical overviews such as box plots, histograms, but also multivariate tools. The tool is designed to store data from both inbreeding and out-breeding crop species and the analysis and visualization methods adapt automatically to the type of population on hand.",
