Combined analyses of molecular data at multiple levels, such as DNA copy-number alteration, mRNA and miRNA expression, can clarify biological functions and pathways deregulated in cancer. The integrative methods that are used to investigate these data involve different fields, including biology, bioinformatics, and statistics. Results: These methodologies are presented in this review, and their implementation in breast cancer is discussed with a focus on integration strategies. We report current applications, recent studies and interesting results leading to the identification of candidate biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in breast cancer by using both individual and combined analyses. Conclusion: This review presents a state of art of the role of different technologies in breast cancer based on the integration of genetics and epigenetics, and shares some issues related to the new opportunities and challenges offered by the application of such integrative approaches.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Cava C."}, {"name": "Bertoli G."}, {"name": "Castiglioni I."}], "date": "2015-09-21T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Claudia Cava", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "claudia.cava@ibfm.cnr.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:starbiotrek", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.0.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/StarBioTrek.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool presents some methodologies to measure pathway activity and cross-talk among pathways integrating also the information of network data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/claudiacava/StarBioTrek", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "starbiotrek", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:03:38Z", "name": "StarBioTrek", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/StarBioTrek.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
