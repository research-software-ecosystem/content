      "sc:description": "PathML is a unified framework for whole-slide image analysis with deep learning. The inspection of stained tissue slides by pathologists is essential for the early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Recently, deep learning methods for the analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) have shown excellent performance on these tasks, and have the potential to substantially reduce the workload of pathologists. However, successful implementation of deep learning for WSI analysis is complex and requires careful consideration of model hyperparameters, slide and image artefacts, and data augmentation. Here we introduce PathML, a Python library for performing preand post-processing of WSIs, which has been designed to interact with the most widely used deep learning libraries, PyTorch and TensorFlow, thus allowing seamless integration into deep learning workflows",
