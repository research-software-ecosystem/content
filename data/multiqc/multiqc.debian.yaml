summary: output integration for RNA sequencing across tools and samples
description: >
  The sequencing of DNA or RNA with current high-throughput technologies
  involves an array of tools and these are applied over a range of samples.
  It is easy to loose oversight. And gathering the data and forwarding
  them in a readable manner to the individuals who took the samples is
  a challenge for a tool in itself. Well. Here it is.
  MultiQC aggregates the output of multiple tools into a single report.
  .
  Reports are generated by scanning given directories for recognised log
  files. These are parsed and a single HTML report is generated summarising
  the statistics for all logs found. MultiQC reports can describe multiple
  analysis steps and large numbers of samples within a single plot, and
  multiple analysis tools making it ideal for routine fast quality control.
