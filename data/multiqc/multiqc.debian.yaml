description: "The sequencing of DNA or RNA with current high-throughput technologies\
  \ involves an array of tools and these are applied over a range of samples. It is\
  \ easy to loose oversight. And gathering the data and forwarding them in a readable\
  \ manner to the individuals who took the samples is a challenge for a tool in itself.\
  \ Well. Here it is. MultiQC aggregates the output of multiple tools into a single\
  \ report. . Reports are generated by scanning given directories for recognised log\
  \ files. These are parsed and a single HTML report is generated summarising the\
  \ statistics for all logs found. MultiQC reports can describe multiple analysis\
  \ steps and large numbers of samples within a single plot, and multiple analysis\
  \ tools making it ideal for routine fast quality control.\n"
