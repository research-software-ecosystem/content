All rights reserved.Hybrid methods that combine quantum mechanics (QM) and molecular mechanics (MM) can be applied to studies of reaction mechanisms in locations ranging from active sites of small enzymes to multiple sites in large bioenergetic complexes. By combining the widely used molecular dynamics and visualization programs NAMD and VMD with the quantum chemistry packages ORCA and MOPAC, we created an integrated, comprehensive, customizable, and easy-to-use suite (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/qmmm). Through the QwikMD interface, setup, execution, visualization, and analysis are streamlined for all levels of expertise.","authors":["Melo M.C.R.","Bernardi R.C.","Rudack T.","Scheurer M.","Riplinger C.","Phillips J.C.","Maia J.D.C.","Rocha G.B.","Ribeiro J.V.","Stone J.E.","Neese F.","Schulten K.","Luthey-Schulten Z."],"cit_count":7,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4638","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"NAMD goes quantum: An integrative suite for hybrid simulations","year":"2018-04-27"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:qmmm","biotoolsID":"qmmm","description":"NAMD QM/MM interface extends existing NAMD features to the quantum mechanical level, presenting features that are not yet available in any QM/MM implementation.","homepage":"http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/qmmm/","name":"Hybrid QM-MM NAMD"}}
