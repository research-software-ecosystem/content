See Wikipedia for details. We implement a robust version of the Z-score where the SD is replaced by MAD and mean by median.\n\nA desirable compound should exhibit large values of efficacy and smaller values for potency. Thus, in this plot, the efficacy curve is ideally located at higher values of Z and the potency curve at smaller (i.e., more negative) values of Z.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/probis-charmming (NIH.GOV)","homepage":"https://tripod.nih.gov/canvass","name":"Canvass"}}
