description: The package implements MBASED algorithm for detecting allele-specific
  gene expression from RNA count data, where allele counts at individual loci (SNVs)
  are integrated into a gene-specific measure of ASE, and utilizes simulations to
  appropriately assess the statistical significance of observed ASE.
