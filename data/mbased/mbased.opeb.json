Allele-specific gene expression, ASE, is an important aspect of gene regulation. We developed a novel method MBASED, meta-analysis based allele-specific expression detection for ASE detection using RNA-seq data that aggregates information across multiple single nucleotide variation loci to obtain a gene-level measure of ASE, even when prior phasing information is unavailable. MBASED is capable of one-sample and two-sample analyses and performs well in simulations. We applied MBASED to a panel of cancer cell lines and paired tumor-normal tissue samples, and observed extensive ASE in cancer, but not normal, samples, mainly driven by genomic copy number alterations.","authors":["Mayba O.","Gilbert H.N.","Liu J.","Haverty P.M.","Jhunjhunwala S.","Jiang Z.","Watanabe C.","Zhang Z."],"cit_count":39,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-014-0405-3","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"MBASED: Allele-specific expression detection in cancer tissues and cell lines","type":"Primary","year":"2014-08-07"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mbased","biotoolsID":"mbased","description":"The package implements the corresponding algorithm for detecting allele-specific gene expression from RNA count data, where allele counts at individual loci (SNVs) are integrated into a gene-specific measure of ASE, and utilizes simulations to appropriately assess the statistical significance of observed ASE.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MBASED.html","name":"MBASED","version":["1.8.0"]}}
