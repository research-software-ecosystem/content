Allele-specific gene expression, ASE, is an important aspect of gene regulation. We developed a novel method MBASED, meta-analysis based allele-specific expression detection for ASE detection using RNA-seq data that aggregates information across multiple single nucleotide variation loci to obtain a gene-level measure of ASE, even when prior phasing information is unavailable. MBASED is capable of one-sample and two-sample analyses and performs well in simulations. We applied MBASED to a panel of cancer cell lines and paired tumor-normal tissue samples, and observed extensive ASE in cancer, but not normal, samples, mainly driven by genomic copy number alterations.", "citationCount": 39, "authors": [{"name": "Mayba O."}, {"name": "Gilbert H.N."}, {"name": "Liu J."}, {"name": "Haverty P.M."}, {"name": "Jhunjhunwala S."}, {"name": "Jiang Z."}, {"name": "Watanabe C."}, {"name": "Zhang Z."}], "date": "2014-08-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Oleg Mayba", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mayba.oleg@gene.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mbased", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.8.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MBASED.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA-Seq quantification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3800"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The package implements the corresponding algorithm for detecting allele-specific gene expression from RNA count data, where allele counts at individual loci (SNVs) are integrated into a gene-specific measure of ASE, and utilizes simulations to appropriately assess the statistical significance of observed ASE.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "mbased", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:03:22Z", "name": "MBASED", "license": "Artistic-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MBASED.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
