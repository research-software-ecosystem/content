Multi-compartment systems are represented as graphs with STNs embedded in each node. Interactions include mass-action, enzymatic, allosteric and connectionist models. Reactions are translated into differential equations and can be solved numerically to generate predictive time courses or output as systems of equations that can be read by other programs. Cellerator simulations are fully extensible and portable to any operating system that supports Mathematica, and can be indefinitely nested within larger data structures to produce highly scaleable models.", "citationCount": 86, "authors": [{"name": "Shapiro B.E."}, {"name": "Levchenko A."}, {"name": "Meyerowitz E.M."}, {"name": "Wold B.J."}, {"name": "Mjolsness E.D."}], "date": "2003-03-22T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bnmc.caltech.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Bruce.E.Shapiro@csun.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:xcellerator", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://xcellerator.info/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0477"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A Mathematica\u00ae\u00a0package designed to aide biological modeling via the automated conversion of chemical reactions into ODEs and their subsequent solution via numerical integration.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Mathematica"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/xcellerator-0-78-mathematica-package-biological-modeling.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "xcellerator", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:08:43Z", "name": "xCellerator", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://xcellerator.info/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
