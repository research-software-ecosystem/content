Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: MEGAHIT is a NGS de novo assembler for assembling large and complex metagenomics data in a time- and cost-efficient manner. It finished assembling a soil metagenomics dataset with 252∈Gbps in 44.1 and 99.6∈h on a single computing node with and without a graphics processing unit, respectively. MEGAHIT assembles the data as a whole, i.e. no pre-processing like partitioning and normalization was needed. When compared with previous methods on assembling the soil data, MEGAHIT generated a three-time larger assembly, with longer contig N50 and average contig length; furthermore, 55.8% of the reads were aligned to the assembly, giving a fourfold improvement.","authors":["Li D.","Liu C.-M.","Luo R.","Sadakane K.","Lam T.-W."],"cit_count":273,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25609793","title":"MEGAHIT: An ultra-fast single-node solution for large and complex metagenomics assembly via succinct de Bruijn graph","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:megahit","biotoolsID":"megahit","description":"Single node assembler for large and complex metagenomics NGS reads, such as soil.
