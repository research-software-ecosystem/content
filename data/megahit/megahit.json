Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: MEGAHIT is a NGS de novo assembler for assembling large and complex metagenomics data in a time- and cost-efficient manner. It finished assembling a soil metagenomics dataset with 252\u2208Gbps in 44.1 and 99.6\u2208h on a single computing node with and without a graphics processing unit, respectively. MEGAHIT assembles the data as a whole, i.e. no pre-processing like partitioning and normalization was needed. When compared with previous methods on assembling the soil data, MEGAHIT generated a three-time larger assembly, with longer contig N50 and average contig length; furthermore, 55.8% of the reads were aligned to the assembly, giving a fourfold improvement.", "citationCount": 273, "authors": [{"name": "Li D."}, {"name": "Liu C.-M."}, {"name": "Luo R."}, {"name": "Sadakane K."}, {"name": "Lam T.-W."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "L3 Bioinformatics Limited", "url": "https://github.com/voutcn", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "rb@l3-bioinfo.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:megahit", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/voutcn/megahit", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genome assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0525"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Single node assembler for large and complex metagenomics NGS reads, such as soil.
