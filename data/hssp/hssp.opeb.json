We present a series of databases that run parallel to the PDB. Each database holds one entry, if possible, for each PDB entry. DSSP holds the secondary structure of the proteins. PDBREPORT holds reports on the structure quality and lists errors. HSSP holds a multiple sequence alignment for all proteins. The PDBFINDER holds easy to parse summaries of the PDB file content, augmented with essentials from the other systems. PDB-REDO holds re-refined, and often improved, copies of all structures solved by X-ray. WHY NOT summarizes why certain files could not be produced. All these systems are updated weekly. The data sets can be used for the analysis of properties of protein structures in areas ranging from structural genomics, to cancer biology and protein design. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Joosten R.P.","Te Beek T.A.H.","Krieger E.","Hekkelman M.L.","Hooft R.W.W.","Schneider R.","Sander C.","Vriend G."],"cit_count":336,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkq1105","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"A series of PDB related databases for everyday needs","type":"Primary","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:hssp","biotoolsID":"hssp","description":"Homology-derived secondary structure of proteins database.","homepage":"http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/hssp/","name":"HSSP"}}
