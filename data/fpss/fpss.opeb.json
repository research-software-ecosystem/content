Pennsylvania developed the nation's first FPS program and remains at the forefront of the field. This paper responds to three research questions regarding forensic peer support in Pennsylvania, assessing: (a) employment patterns and demographic characteristics; (b) work tasks and sites; and (c) challenges and benefits of working as an FPS. METHOD:Data are drawn from a larger mixed-methods study of forensic peer support in Pennsylvania, including a detailed online survey of 117 FPS-trained workers, followed by 16 qualitative interviews with a subset of survey respondents.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'forensic peer specialists', 'PRACTICE:Study', 'FPSs lived', 'FPSs passionate'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31621351","name":"FPSs"}}
