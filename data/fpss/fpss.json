    "description": "Training, employment, and lived experience.\n\nOBJECTIVE:Despite calls for increased peer support services for individuals involved with the criminal justice system, little is known about the training, employment, and characteristics of forensic peer specialists (FPSs). Pennsylvania developed the nation's first FPS program and remains at the forefront of the field. This paper responds to three research questions regarding forensic peer support in Pennsylvania, assessing: (a) employment patterns and demographic characteristics; (b) work tasks and sites; and (c) challenges and benefits of working as an FPS. METHOD:Data are drawn from a larger mixed-methods study of forensic peer support in Pennsylvania, including a detailed online survey of 117 FPS-trained workers, followed by 16 qualitative interviews with a subset of survey respondents.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'forensic peer specialists', 'PRACTICE:Study', 'FPSs lived', 'FPSs passionate'",
