                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.Gene duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism capable of providing new genetic material, which in some instances can help organisms adapt to various environmental conditions. Recent studies, for example, have indicated that highly similar duplicate genes (HSDs) are aiding adaptation to extreme conditions via gene dosage. However, for most eukaryotic genomes HSDs remain uncharacterized, partly because they can be hard to identify and categorize efficiently and effectively. Here, we collected and curated HSDs in nuclear genomes from various model animals, land plants and algae and indexed them in an online, open-access sequence repository called HSDatabase. Currently, this database contains 117 864 curated HSDs from 40 distinct genomes; it includes statistics on the total number of HSDs per genome as well as individual HSD copy numbers/lengths and provides sequence alignments of the duplicate gene copies. HSDatabase also allows users to download sequences of gene copies, access genome browsers, and link out to other databases, such as Pfam and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. What is more, a built-in Basic Local Alignment Search Tool option is available to conveniently explore potential homologous sequences of interest within and across species. HSDatabase has a user-friendly interface and provides easy access to the source data. It can be used on its own for comparative analyses of gene duplicates or in conjunction with HSDFinder, a newly developed bioinformatics tool for identifying, annotating, categorizing and visualizing HSDs.
