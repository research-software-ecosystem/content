We describe a method, DOMAINATION, that infers domains and their boundaries in a query sequence from local gapped alignments generated using PSI-BLAST. Through a new technique to recognize domain insertions and permutations, DOMAINATION submits delineated domains as successive database queries in further iterative steps. Assessed over a set of 452 multidomain proteins, the method predicts structural domain boundaries with an overall accuracy of 50% and improves finding distant homologies by 14% compared with PSI-BLAST. DOMAINATION is available as a web based tool at http://mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk, and the source code is available from the authors upon request. © Wiley-Liss, Inc.","authors":["George R.A.","Heringa J."],"cit_count":51,"doi":"10.1002/prot.10175","journal":"Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics","title":"Protein domain identification and improved sequence similarity searching using PSI-BLAST","type":"Primary","year":"2002-09-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:domaination","biotoolsID":"domaination","description":"Method to identify domains in a protein sequence from similarity searches using PSI-BLAST.
