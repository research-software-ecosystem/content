                "abstract": "\u00a9 2015 The Author(s).Protein complexes are involved in many biological processes. Examining coupling between subunits of a complexwould be useful to understand themolecular basis of protein function. Here, our updated (PS)2 web server predicts the three-dimensional structures of protein complexes based on comparative modeling; furthermore, this server examines the coupling between subunits of the predicted complex by combining structural and evolutionary considerations. The predicted complex structure could be indicated and visualized by Java-based 3D graphics viewers and the structural and evolutionary profiles are shown and compared chain-by-chain. For each subunit, considerations with or without the packing contribution of other subunits cause the differences in similarities between structural and evolutionary profiles, and these differences imply which form, complex or monomeric, is preferred in the biological condition for the subunit. We believe that the (PS)2 server would be a useful tool for biologists who are interested not only in the structures of protein complexes but also in the coupling between subunits of the complexes. The (PS)2 is freely available at http://ps2v3.life.nctu.edu.tw/.",
