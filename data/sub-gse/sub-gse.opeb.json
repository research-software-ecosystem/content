These approaches usually combine gene expression data with functionally related gene sets as defined in databases such as GeneOntology (GO), KEGG, or BioCarta. The results based on gene set analysis are generally more biologically interpretable, accurate and robust than the results based on individual gene analysis. However, while most available methods for gene set enrichment analysis test the enrichment of the entire gene set, it is more likely that only a subset of the genes in the gene set may be related to the phenotypes of interest. Results: In this paper, we develop a novel method, termed Sub-GSE, which measures the enrichment of a predefined gene set, or pathway, by testing its subsets. The application of Sub-GSE to two simulated and two real datasets shows Sub-GSE to be more sensitive than previous methods, such as GSEA, GSA, and SigPath, in detecting gene sets assiated with a phenotype of interest. This is particularly true for cases in which only a fraction of the genes in the gene set are associated with the phenotypes. Furthermore, the application of Sub-GSE to two real data sets demonstrates that it can detect more biologically meaningful gene sets than GSEA. Conclusion: We developed a new method to measure the gene set enrichment. Applications to two simulated datasets and two real datasets show that this method is sensitive to the associations between gene sets and phenotype. © 2008 Yan and Sun; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Yan X.","Sun F."],"cit_count":18,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-9-362","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"Testing gene set enrichment for subset of genes: Sub-GSE","type":"Primary","year":"2008-09-02"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sub-gse","biotoolsID":"sub-gse","description":"It is developed for gene set enrichment analysis.The primary objective of this program is to measure the enrichment of differentially expressed or phenotype associated genes in given gene sets.The input for the program includes the gene expression data of several samples with corresponding phenotypic data and several given gene sets.The program will assess the significance of the enrichment of genes, whose gene expression profiles are associated with the phenotypic data, in each given gene set.","homepage":"http://www-rcf.usc.edu/~fsun/Programs/SubGSEWebPages/SubGSEMain.html","name":"Sub-GSE"}}
