      "sc:description": "an integrated database of stomach cancer.\n\nStomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC. METHODS:SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases",
