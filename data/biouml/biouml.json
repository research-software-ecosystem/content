It spans the comprehensive range of capabilities including access to databases with experimental data, tools for formalized description of biological systems structure and functioning, as well as tools for their visualization, simulation, parameters fitting and analyses. Due to scripts (R, JavaScript) and workflow support it provides powerful possibilities for analyses of high-throughput data.",

                "abstract": "Using a modular principle of computer hardware as a metaphor, we defined and implemented in the BioUML platform a module concept for biological pathways. BioUML provides a user interface to create modular models and convert them automatically into plain models for further simulations. Using this approach, we created the apoptosis model including 13 modules: death stimuli (TRAIL, CD95L, and TNF-α)-induced activation of caspase-8; survival stimuli (p53, EGF, and NF-κB) regulation; the mitochondria level; cytochrome C- and Smac-induced activation of caspase-3; direct activation of effector caspases by caspase-8 and - 12; PARP and apoptosis execution phase modules. Each module is based on earlier published models and extended by data from the Reactome and TRANSPATH databases. The model ability to simulate the apoptosis-related processes was checked; the modules were validated using experimental data.
