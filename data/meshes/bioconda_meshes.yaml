description: MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) is the NLM controlled vocabulary used
  to manually index articles for MEDLINE/PubMed. MeSH terms were associated by Entrez
  Gene ID by three methods, gendoo, gene2pubmed and RBBH. This association is fundamental
  for enrichment and semantic analyses. meshes supports enrichment analysis (over-representation
  and gene set enrichment analysis) of gene list or whole expression profile. The
  semantic comparisons of MeSH terms provide quantitative ways to compute similarities
  between genes and gene groups. meshes implemented five methods proposed by Resnik,
  Schlicker, Jiang, Lin and Wang respectively and supports more than 70 species.
