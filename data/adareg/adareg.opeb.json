The large-scale data set is a powerful resource for understanding the human transcriptome. However, the technical variation, sequencing background noise and unknown factors make the statistical analysis challenging. To eliminate the possibility that outliers might affect the estimation of population distribution, we need a more robust estimation method, a method that will adapt to heterogeneous genes and further optimize the estimate for each gene.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'data-adaptive', '+', 'GTEx' (bio.tools/gtex), '-density-power-weight'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/869362","name":"AdaReg"}}
