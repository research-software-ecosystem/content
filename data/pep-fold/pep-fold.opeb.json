We present PEP-FOLD, an online service, aimed at de novo modelling of 3D conformations for peptides between 9 and 25 amino acids in aqueous solution. Using a hidden Markov model-derived structural alphabet (SA) of 27 four-residue letters, PEP-FOLD first predicts the SA letter profiles from the amino acid sequence and then assembles the predicted fragments by a greedy procedure driven by a modified version of the OPEP coarse-grained force field. Starting from an amino acid sequence, PEP-FOLD performs series of 50 simulations and returns the most representative conformations identified in terms of energy and population. Using a benchmark of 25 peptides with 9-23 amino acids, and considering the reproducibility of the runs, we find that, on average, PEP-FOLD locates lowest energy conformations differing by 2.6 Å Cα root mean square deviation from the full NMR structures. PEP-FOLD can be accessed at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/ PEP-FOLD.",

We present an updated version of PEP-FOLD allowing the treatment of both linear and disulphide bonded cyclic peptides with 9-36 amino acids. The server makes possible to define disulphide bonds and any residue-residue proximity under the guidance of the biologists. Using a benchmark of 34 cyclic peptides with one, two and three disulphide bonds, the best PEP-FOLD models deviate by an average RMS of 2.75Å from the full NMR structures. Using a benchmark of 37 linear peptides, PEP-FOLD locates lowest-energy conformations deviating by 3Å RMS from the NMR rigid cores. The evolution of PEP-FOLD comes as a new on-line service to supersede the previous server. The server is available at: http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris- diderot.fr/PEP-FOLD. © 2012 The Author(s).",

Structure determination of linear peptides of 5-50 amino acids in aqueous solution and interacting with proteins is a key aspect in structural biology. PEP-FOLD3 is a novel computational framework, that allows both (i) de novo free or biased prediction for linear peptides between 5 and 50 amino acids, and (ii) the generation of native-like conformations of peptides interacting with a protein when the interaction site is known in advance. PEP-FOLD3 is fast, and usually returns solutions in a few minutes. Testing PEP-FOLD3 on 56 peptides in aqueous solution led to experimental-like conformations for 80% of the targets. Using a benchmark of 61 peptide-protein targets starting from the unbound form of the protein receptor, PEP-FOLD3 was able to generate peptide poses deviating on average by 3.3Å from the experimental conformation and return a native-like pose in the first 10 clusters for 52% of the targets. PEP-FOLD3 is available at http://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/PEP-FOLD3.",
