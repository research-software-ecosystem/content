We define here the \"codonome value\" as the total number of codons present across all the expressed mRNAs in a given biological condition. We have developed the \"CODONOME\" software, which calculates the codon bias and, following integration with a gene expression profile, estimates the actual frequency of each codon at the transcriptome level (codonome bias) of a given tissue. Systematic analysis across different human tissues and multiple species shows a surprisingly tight correlation between the codon bias and the codonome bias. An aneuploidy and cancer condition such as that of Down Syndrome-related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (DS-AMKL), does not appear to alter this relationship. The law of correlation between codon bias and codonome emerges as a property of the distribution and range of the number, sequence and expression level of the genes in a genome. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Inc.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Piovesan A."}, {"name": "Vitale L."}, {"name": "Pelleri M.C."}, {"name": "Strippoli P."}], "date": "2013-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:Codonome", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://apollo11.isto.unibo.it/software/Codonome/", "function": [], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-26T16:42:17Z", "otherID": [], "description": "CODONOME collects the expression value of each codon (just called \"codonome\") and of each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS).
