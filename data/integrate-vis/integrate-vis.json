Despite the increasing quantity of tools for accurately predicting gene fusion candidates from sequencing data, we are still faced with the critical challenge of visualizing the corresponding gene fusion products to infer their biological consequence (i.e. novel protein and increased gene expression). This is currently accomplished by manually inspecting and inferring the biological consequence of top scoring gene fusion candidates. This labor-intensive process could be made easier by automating the annotation of gene fusion products and generating easily interpretable visualizations. We developed a gene fusion visualization tool, called INTEGRATE-Vis, that generates comprehensive, highly customizable, publication-quality graphics focused on annotating each gene fusion at the transcript- and protein-level and assessing expression within an individual sample or across a patient cohort. INTEGRATE-Vis is the first comprehensive gene fusion visualization tool to help a user infer the potential consequence of a gene fusion event. It has potential utility in both research and clinical settings. INTEGRATE-Vis is available at https://github.com/ChrisMaherLab/INTEGRATE-Vis.",
