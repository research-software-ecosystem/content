                "abstract": "Analysis of intra- and extracellular dynamic like vesicles transport involves particle tracking algorithms. The design of a particle tracking pipeline is a routine but tedious task. Therefore, particle dynamics analysis is often performed by combining several pieces of software (filtering, detection, tracking, etc.) requiring many manual operations, and thus leading to poorly reproducible results. Given the new segmentation tools based on deep learning, modularity and interoperability between software have become essential in particle tracking algorithms. A good synergy between a particle detector and a tracker is of paramount importance. In addition, a user-friendly interface to control the quality of estimated trajectories is necessary. To address these issues, we developed STracking, a Python library that allows combining algorithms into standardized particle tracking pipelines.",
