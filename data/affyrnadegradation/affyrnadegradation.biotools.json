    "description": "The package helps with the assessment and correction of RNA degradation effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The parameter d gives a robust and accurate measure of RNA integrity. The correction removes the probe positional bias, and thus improves comparability of samples that are affected by RNA degradation.",

Factors posterior to RNA extraction can, however, impair their accurate representation. RNA degradation and differences in the efficiency of amplification affect raw intensity measurements using Affymetrix expression arrays. The positional intensity decay of specifically hybridized probes along the transcript they intend to interrogate is used to estimate the RNA quality in a sample and to correct probe intensities for the degradation bias. This functionality, for which no previous software solution is available, is implemented in the R/Bioconductor package AffyRNADegradation presented here. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.
