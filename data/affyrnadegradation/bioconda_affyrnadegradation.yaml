description: The package helps with the assessment and correction of RNA degradation
  effects in Affymetrix 3' expression arrays. The parameter d gives a robust and accurate
  measure of RNA integrity. The correction removes the probe positional bias, and
  thus improves comparability of samples that are affected by RNA degradation.
