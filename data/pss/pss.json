With the increasing number of protein structures becoming available, there is a need for new tools capable of automating the structural comparison of large ensemble of structures. We present Protein Structural Statistics (PSS), a command-line program written in Perl for Unix-like environments, dedicated to the calculation of structural statistics for a set of proteins. PSS can perform multiple sequence alignments, structure superpositions, calculate Cartesian and dihedral coordinate statistics, and execute cluster analyses. An HTML report that contains a convenient summary of results with figures, tables, and hyperlinks can also be produced. PSS is a new tool providing an automated way to compare multiple structures. It integrates various types of structural analyses through an user-friendly and flexible interface, facilitating the access to powerful but more specialized programs. PSS is easy to modify and extend and is distributed under a free and open source license. The relevance of PSS is illustrated by examples of application to pertinent biological problems. \u00a9 2013 American Chemical Society.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Gaillard T."}, {"name": "Schwarz B.B.L."}, {"name": "Chebaro Y."}, {"name": "Stote R.H."}, {"name": "Dejaegere A."}], "date": "2013-09-23T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://thomasgaillard.fr/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "thomas.gaillard@polytechnique.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pss", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://thomasgaillard.fr/pss/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Multiple sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0492"}, {"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}, {"term": "Structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2480"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Protein structural statistics program for Unix-like environments.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pss-pssweb-protein-structural-statistics.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "pss", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:54:53Z", "name": "PSS", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://thomasgaillard.fr/pss/#doc", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
