The ncRNAome is composed of a multitude of RNAs, such as transfer RNA, small nucleolar RNA and microRNA (miRNA), to name few. Here we present omiRas, a Web server for the annotation, comparison and visualization of interaction networks of ncRNAs derived from next-generation sequencing experiments of two different conditions. The Web tool allows the user to submit raw sequencing data and results are presented as: (i) static annotation results including length distribution, mapping statistics, alignments and quantification tables for each library as well as lists of differentially expressed ncRNAs between conditions and (ii) an interactive network visualization of user-selected miRNAs and their target genes based on the combination of several miRNA-mRNA interaction databases. Availability and Implementation: The omiRas Web server is implemented in Python, PostgreSQL, R and can be accessed at: http://tools.genxpro.net/omiras/.
