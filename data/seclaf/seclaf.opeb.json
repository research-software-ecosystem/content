Learning algorithms can be taught for specific tasks by using the existing enormous biological databases, and the resulting models can be used for the high-quality classification of novel, un-categorized data in numerous areas, including biological sequence analysis. Here, we introduce SECLAF, a webserver that uses deep neural networks for hierarchical biological sequence classification. By applying SECLAF for residue-sequences, we have reported [Methods (2018), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth. 2017.06.034] the most accurate multi-label protein classifier to date (UniProt-into 698 classes-AUC 99.99%; Gene Ontology-into 983 classes-AUC 99.45%). Our framework SECLAF can be applied for other sequence classification tasks, as we describe in the present contribution. Availability and implementation: The program SECLAF is implemented in Python, and is available for download, with example datasets at the website https://pitgroup.org/seclaf/. For Gene Ontology and UniProt based classifications a webserver is also available at the address above.","authors":["Szalkai B.","Grolmusz V."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty116","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"SECLAF: A webserver and deep neural network design tool for hierarchical biological sequence classification","type":"Primary","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:SECLAF","biotoolsID":"SECLAF","description":"Webserver and deep neural network design tool for hierarchical biological sequence classification.","homepage":"https://pitgroup.org/seclaf/","name":"SECLAF"}}
