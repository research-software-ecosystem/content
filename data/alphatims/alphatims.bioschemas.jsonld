      "sc:description": "Indexing Trapped Ion Mobility Spectrometry-TOF Data for Fast and Easy Accession and Visualization.\n\nHigh-resolution MS-based proteomics generates large amounts of data, even in the standard LC-tandem MS configuration. Adding an ion mobility dimension vastly increases the acquired data volume, challenging both analytical processing pipelines and especially data exploration by scientists. This has necessitated data aggregation, effectively discarding much of the information present in these rich datasets. Taking trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) on a quadrupole TOF (Q-TOF) platform as an example, we developed an efficient indexing scheme that represents all data points as detector arrival times on scales of minutes (LC), milliseconds (TIMS), and microseconds (TOF). In our open-source AlphaTims package, data are indexed, accessed, and visualized by a combination of tools of the scientific Python ecosystem",
