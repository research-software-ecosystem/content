An empirical study and a benchmark.\n\nBackground Today, redundancy in source code, so-called “clones”, caused by copy&paste can be found reliably using clone detection tools. Redundancy can arise also independently, however, caused not by copy&paste. At present, it is not clear how only functionally similar clones (FSC) differ from clones created by copy&paste. Our aim is to understand and categorise the syntactic differences in FSCs that distinguish them from copy&paste clones in a way that helps clone detection research. Methods. We conducted an experiment using known functionally similar programs in Java and C from coding contests. We analysed syntactic similarity with traditional detection tools and explored whether concolic clone detection can go beyond syntax.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'copy and paste', 'concolic', 'FSC', 'syntactic'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.1516V2","name":"FSCs"}}
