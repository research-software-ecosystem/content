The service is completely free and just requires a quick registration. Login/Register.\n\nToxins can be retrieved by the following fields: common name, CAS number, InChI, InChI key.\n\nIn recent years, biogenic toxins have received increasing attention because of their high contamination levels in feeds, foods, and environments.\n\nExample: Common name: Aflatoxin : CAS number: 65195-55-3: InChI key: JLWQFKMKUKQXMW-IYSWYEEDSA-N.",
