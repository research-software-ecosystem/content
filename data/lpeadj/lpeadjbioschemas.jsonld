  "sc:description": "Two options are added to the LPE algorithm, which original version sets all variances below the max variance in the ordered distribution of variances to the maximum variance. In the present version, this option is turned off by default. The second option is to use a variance adjustment based on sample size rather than pi/2.  By default, the tool uses the sample size based variance adjustment.",
