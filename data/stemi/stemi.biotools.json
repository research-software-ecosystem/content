Objective Apply machine learning for the prediction and identification of factors associated with short and long-term mortality in Asian STEMI patients and compare with a conventional risk score. Methods The National Cardiovascular Disease Database for Malaysia registry, of a multi-ethnic, heterogeneous Asian population was used for in-hospital (6299 patients), 30-days (3130 patients), and 1-year (2939 patients) model development. 50 variables were considered. Mortality prediction was analysed using feature selection methods with machine learning algorithms and compared to Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score. Invasive management of varying degrees was selected as important variables that improved mortality prediction. Results Model performance using a complete and reduced variable produced an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.73 to 0.90. The best machine learning model for in-hospital, 30 days, and 1-year outperformed TIMI risk score (AUC = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.846-0.910; vs AUC = 0.81, 95% CI:0.772-0.845, AUC = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.870-0.935; vs AUC = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.746-0.838, AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.798-0.872; vs AUC = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.715-0.802, p < 0.0001 for all). TIMI score underestimates patients' risk of mortality. 90% of non-survival patients are classified as high risk (>50%) by machine learning algorithm compared to 10-30% non-survival patients by TIMI. Common predictors identified for short- and long-term mortality were age, heart rate, Killip class, fasting blood glucose, prior primary PCI or pharmaco-invasive therapy and diuretics. The final algorithm was converted into an online tool with a database for continuous data archiving for algorithm validation. Conclusions In a multi-ethnic population, patients with STEMI were better classified using the machine learning method compared to TIMI scoring. Machine learning allows for the identification of distinct factors in individual Asian populations for better mortality prediction. Ongoing continuous testing and validation will allow for better risk stratification and potentially alter management and outcomes in the future. Copyright:",

                "abstract": "© 2021 Bai et al.Purpose: This study aimed to establish an accurate and easy predictive model for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with hyperuricemia, using readily available features to estimate intrahospital mortality risk. Patients and Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective study involving the development of risk prediction models for intrahospital mortality among all STEMI patients with hyperur-icemia from Zunyi Medical University Chest Pain Center’s specialized alliance between January 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. The primary outcome was intrahospital mortality. A total of 48 candidate variables were considered from demographic and clinical data. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to develop a nomogram. Concordance index values, decision curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC), and clinical impact curves were examined. In this study, 489 patients with STEMI were included in the training dataset and an additional 209 patients from the 44 chest pain centers were included in the test cohort. B-type natriuretic peptides, α-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (α-HBDH), cystatin C, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), shock index, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were associated with intrahospital mortality and included in the nomogram. Results: The model showed good discrimination power, and the AUC generated to predict survival in the training set was 0.875 (95% confidence interval, 0.825–0.925). In the validation set, the AUC of survival predictions was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.792– 0.947). Calibration plots and decision curve analysis showed good model performance in both datasets. A web-based calculator (https://bzxzmu.shinyapps.io/STEMI-with-Hyperuricemia-intrahospital-mortality/) was established based on the nomogram model, which was used to measure the levels of OHCA, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, shock index, α-HBDH, cystatin C, and B-type natriuretic peptides. Conclusion: For practical applications, this model may prove clinically useful for persona-lized therapy management in patients with STEMI with hyperuricemia.",
