Motivation: Despite the potential usefulness, the association analysis of gene expression with interval times of two events has been hampered because the occurrence of events can be censored and the conventional survival analysis is not suitable to handle two censored events. However, the recent advances of multivariate survival analysis considering multiple censored events together provide an unprecedented chance for this problem. Based on such advances, we have developed a software tool, GAIT, for the association analysis of gene expression with interval time of two events. Results: The performance of GAIT was demonstrated by simulation studies and the real data analysis. The result indicates the usefulness of GAIT in a wide range of biomedical applications.",
