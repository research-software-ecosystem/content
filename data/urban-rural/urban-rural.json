CDC twenty four seven. Saving Lives, Protecting People.\n\nNCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties.\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics.\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data systems are often used to study the associations between urbanization level of residence and health and to monitor the health of urban and rural residents. NCHS has developed a six-level urban-rural classification scheme for U.S. counties and county-equivalent entities. The most urban category consists of \u201ccentral\u201d counties of large metropolitan areas and the most rural category consists of nonmetropolitan \u201cnoncore\u201d counties. Three versions of the NCHS scheme are available:",
