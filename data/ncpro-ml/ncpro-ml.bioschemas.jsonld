      "sc:description": "An integrated computational tool for identifying non-coding RNA promoters in multiple species.\n\nThe promoter is located near the transcription start sites and regulates transcription initiation of the gene. Accurate identification of promoters is essential for understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Since experimental methods are costly and ineffective, developing efficient and accurate computational tools to identify promoters are necessary. Although a series of methods have been proposed for identifying promoters, none of them is able to identify the promoters of non-coding RNA (ncRNA). In the present work, a new method called ncPro-ML was proposed to identify the promoter of ncRNA in Homo sapiens and Mus musculus, in which different kinds of sequence encoding schemes were used to convert DNA sequences into feature vectors. To test the length effect, for each species, datasets including sequences with different lengths were built",
