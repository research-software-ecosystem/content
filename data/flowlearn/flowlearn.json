Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Identification of cell populations in flow cytometry is a critical part of the analysis and lays the groundwork for many applications and research discovery. The current paradigm of manual analysis is time consuming and subjective. A common goal of users is to replace manual analysis with automated methods that replicate their results. Supervised tools provide the best performance in such a use case, however they require fine parameterization to obtain the best results. Hence, there is a strong need for methods that are fast to setup, accurate and interpretable. Results: flowLearn is a semi-supervised approach for the quality-checked identification of cell populations. Using a very small number of manually gated samples, through density alignments it is able to predict gates on other samples with high accuracy and speed. On two state-of-the-art datasets, our tool achieves median?F1?-measures exceeding 0.99 for 31%, and 0.90 for 80% of all analyzed populations. Furthermore, users can directly interpret and adjust automated gates on new sample files to iteratively improve the initial training.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Lux M."}, {"name": "Brinkman R.R."}, {"name": "Chauve C."}, {"name": "Laing A."}, {"name": "Lorenc A."}, {"name": "Abeler-Dorner L."}, {"name": "Hammer B."}], "date": "2018-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Markus Lux", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mlux@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:flowlearn", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/mlux86/flowLearn", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Spectral analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3214"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast and precise identification and quality checking of cell populations in flow cytometry.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "Shell"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "flowlearn", "additionDate": "2018-06-30T18:00:12Z", "name": "flowLearn", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/mlux86/flowLearn", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
