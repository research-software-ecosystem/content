The information looking by users usually is model entities | Natural Language Interface for Model Entity Discovery (NLIMED) is an interface to search model entities (i.e. flux of sodium across the basolateral plasma membrane, the concentration of potassium in the portion of tissue fluid) in the biosimulation models in repositories. The interface utilises the RDF inside biosimulation models and metadata from BioPortal. Currently, the interface can retrieve model entities from the Physiome Model Repository (PMR, https://models.physiomeproject.org) and the BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/)",
