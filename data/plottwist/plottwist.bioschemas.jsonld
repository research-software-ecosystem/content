  "sc:description": "a web app for plotting and annotating time-series data | a web app for plotting continuous data | PlotTwist (Plotting data from Time-lapse experiments With Indicators of conditions at Set Times) is an app for visualizing the data and statistics of continuous data, with a focus on time-dependent measurements. The philosophy of the approach is that plotting the raw data (instead of a summary) improves transparency and interpretation. To facilitate the visualization of individual measurements, the data can be shown as 'small mutliples' or in 'heatmap-style'. To further facilitate the comparison, the mean and 95% CI can be added. The user has full control over the visibility of the raw data and statistics by adjustment of the transparency (alpha). Several color blind friendly palettes are available to label the data. The comparison of multiple conditions is enabled by multiple file upload (csv or xls format), where each file represents a condition",
