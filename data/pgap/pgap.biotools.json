Therefore, the high-efficiency pipelines for pan-genome analysis are mostly needed. We have developed a new pan-genome analysis pipeline (PGAP), which can perform five analytic functions with only one command, including cluster analysis of functional genes, pan-genome profile analysis, genetic variation analysis of functional genes, species evolution analysis and function enrichment analysis of gene clusters. PGAP's performance has been evaluated on 11 Streptococcus pyogenes strains. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
