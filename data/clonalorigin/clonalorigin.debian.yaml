summary: inference of homologous recombination in bacteria using whole genome sequences
description: >
   Bacteria, unlike us, can reproduce on their own. They do however have
   mechanisms that transfer DNA between organisms, a process more formally
   known as recombination. The mechanisms by which recombination takes
   place have been studied extensively in the laboratory but much remains
   to be understood concerning how, when and where recombination takes
   place within natural populations of bacteria and how it helps them to
   adapt to new environments. ClonalOrigin performs a comparative analysis
   of the sequences of a sample of bacterial genomes in order to
   reconstruct the recombination events that have taken place in their
   ancestry.
