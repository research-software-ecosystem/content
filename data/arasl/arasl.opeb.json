The dataset will provide researcher the opportunity to investigate and develop automated systems for the deaf and hard of hearing people using machine learning, computer vision and deep learning algorithms. The contribution is a large fully-labelled dataset for Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) which is made publically available and free for all researchers. The dataset which is named ArSL2018 consists of 54,049 images for the 32 Arabic sign language sign and alphabets collected from 40 participants in different age groups. Different dimensions and different variations were present in images which can be cleared using pre-processing techniques to remove noise, center the image, etc",
