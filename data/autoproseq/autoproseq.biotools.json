    "description": "XGBoost-based automatic classification of sequence types for prostate mpMRI into T2W, DWI, ADC, DCE and others (any other sequence type) using metadata alone. Works as a CLI, allows direct application to DICOM datasets or CSV/tsv//Excel/parquet datasets, features integration for Orthanc and DICOM-web as RESTful APIs. This was applied to all data on ProCAncer-I to derive initial results for sequence types. Refines predictions using rule-based heuristics for T2W, DWI and ADC.",
