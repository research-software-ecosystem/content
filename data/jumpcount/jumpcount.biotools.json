The widths of confidence intervals and standard errors can be calculated solely from temperature and the number of transitions between states. Uncertainty (95% confidence interval) lower than ±1 kcal/mol can be achieved by a simulation with four forward and four reverse transitions. For a two-state Markovian system, the confidence interval is exact, regardless the number of transitions.",
