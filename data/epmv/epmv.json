Many scientists must also wade through black-box code to interface computational algorithms from diverse sources to supplement their bench work. To reduce these barriers we have developed an open-source plug-in, embedded Python Molecular Viewer (ePMV), that runs molecular modeling software directly inside of professional 3D animation applications (hosts) to provide simultaneous access to the capabilities of these newly connected systems. Uniting host and scientific algorithms into a single interface allows users from varied backgrounds to assemble professional quality visuals and to perform computational experiments with relative ease. By enabling easy exchange of algorithms, ePMV can facilitate interdisciplinary research, smooth communication between broadly diverse specialties, and provide a common platform to frame and visualize the increasingly detailed intersection(s) of cellular and molecular biology. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", "citationCount": 47, "authors": [{"name": "Johnson G.T."}, {"name": "Autin L."}, {"name": "Goodsell D.S."}, {"name": "Sanner M.F."}, {"name": "Olson A.J."}], "date": "2011-03-09T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Structure"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "ePMV Support (Subject:  [ePMV])", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "autin@scripps.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:epmv", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://epmv.scripps.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular model refinement", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0322"}, {"term": "Visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}, {"term": "Molecular dynamics simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}, {"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}, {"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Open-source plug-in, embedded Python Molecular Viewer (ePMV), that runs molecular modeling software directly inside of professional 3D animation applications (blender,maya and cinema4D) to provide simultaneous access the capabilities of all of the systems.
