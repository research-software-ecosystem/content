Data may be converted between three representations (MITAB, edgeList and graph) for use with other R packages such as igraph, graph and RBGL.The user may choose between different methods for resolving redundancies in interaction data and how n-ary data is represented. In addition, we describe a function to identify binary interaction records that possibly represent protein complexes. We show that the user choice of data selection, redundancy resolution and n-ary data representation all have an impact on graphical analysis.Conclusions: The package allows the user to control how these issues are dealt with and communicate them via an R-script written using the iRefR package - this will facilitate communication of methods, reproducibility of network analyses and further modification and comparison of methods by researchers. \u00a9 2011 Mora and Donaldson; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 17, "authors": [{"name": "Mora A."}, {"name": "Donaldson I.M."}], "date": "2011-11-24T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Antonio Mora", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Ian Donaldson", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": [], "name": "R", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Consortium", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "UiO", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "antoniocmora@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:irefr", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.13"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iRefR/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool allows the user to load any version of the consolidated protein interaction database \"iRefIndex\" and perform tasks such as: selecting databases, pmids, experimental methods, searching for specific proteins, separate binary interactions from complexes and polymers, generate complexes according to an algorithm that looks after possible binary-represented complexes, make general database statistics and create network graphs, among others.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "irefr", "additionDate": "2016-03-04T16:59:44Z", "name": "iRefIndex Manager (iRefR)", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iRefR/index.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
