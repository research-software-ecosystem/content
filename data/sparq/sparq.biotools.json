                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The endolysosomal system is critical for protein homeostasis in cells. A common way of studying protein transport and degradation (e.g. via autophagy) is by labeling vesicular structures such as endosomes, autophagosomes, lysosomes, or model substrates with fluorescent tags or by fluorescent antibody staining. Detailed analyses require quantification of hundreds of structures under various conditions. Typically, the images are analyzed individually with software such as the widely available Fiji/ImageJ (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads), adjusting and thresholding each image and channel independently, which is a very labor intensive and fastidious task. To streamline the process, we developed a plug-in that, integrated into Fiji, enables the automated quantification of vesicular (i.e. punctate) structures. Importantly, the process still allows the operator to evaluate and have control over all the phases of quantification process.
