The resulting lower-dimensional representations are often valuable for pattern visualization, clustering, or classification of the data. However, PCA cannot be applied directly to many-omics data sets generated by newer technologies such as label-free mass spectrometry due to large numbers of non-random missing values. Here we present a sequential projection pursuit PCA (sppPCA) method for defining principal components in the presence of missing data. Our results demonstrate that this approach generates robust and informative low-dimensional data representations compared to commonly used imputation approaches.","authors":["Webb-Robertson B.-J.M.","Matzke M.M.","Metz T.O.","Mcdermott J.E.","Walker H.","Rodland K.D.","Pounds J.G.","Waters K.M."],"cit_count":6,"journal":"BioTechniques","pmid":"23477384","title":"Sequential projection pursuit principal component analysis - Dealing with missing data associated with new -omics technologies","year":"2013-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:spppca","biotoolsID":"spppca","description":"The method presented here provides an approach for researchers to perform exploratory data analysis on new -omic datasets containing missing data. By removing the necessity to impute missing values, the results of the low-dimensional projections of the data are not skewed by inaccurate estimates of variance, which is often introduced by imputation.","homepage":"http://cbb.pnnl.gov/portal/software/spppca.html","name":"sppPCA"}}
