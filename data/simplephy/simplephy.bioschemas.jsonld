      "sc:description": "An open-source tool for quick online perception experiments.\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers are facing unprecedented challenges that affect our ability to run in-person experiments. With mandated social distancing in a controlled laboratory environment, many researchers are searching for alternative options to conduct research, such as online experimentation. However, online experimentation comes at a cost; learning online tools for building and publishing psychophysics experiments can be complicated and time-consuming. This learning cost is unfortunate because researchers typically only need to use a small percentage of these tools' capabilities, but they still have to deal with these systems' complexities (e.g., complex graphical user interfaces or difficult programming languages). Furthermore, after the experiment is built, researchers often have to find an online platform compatible with the tool they used to program the experiment",
