The X, Y, Z translation stage is controlled through dedicated software (AMiGUI) that is being made freely available. Movements are controlled by an Arduino-based board running grbl, and the graphical user interface and image acquisition are controlled via a Raspberry Pi microcomputer running Python. Images can be written to the Raspberry Pi or to a remote disk. Plates with multiple sample wells at each row column position are supported, and a script file for automated z-stack depth-of-field enhancement is written along with the images","homepage":"http://AMiGUI.py","name":"AMi"}}
