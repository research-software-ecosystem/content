In disease gene identification and classification, the main aim is to identify disease genes while identifying non-disease genes are of less or no significant. Hence, this task can be defined as a one-class classification problem. Existing machine learning methods typically take into consideration known disease genes as positive training set and unknown genes as negative samples to build a binary-class classification model. Here we propose a new One-class Classification Support Vector Machines (OCSVM) method to precisely classify candidate disease genes.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'One-class Classification Support Vector Machines', 'OCSVM method'","homepage":"https://github.com/imandehzangi/OCSVM","name":"OCSVM"}}
