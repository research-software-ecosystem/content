Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled studies of tissue composition at unprecedented resolution. However, the application of scRNA-seq to clinical cancer samples has been limited, partly due to a lack of scRNA-seq algorithms that integrate genomic mutation data. Results: To address this, we present CONICS: COpy-Number analysis In single-Cell RNA-Sequencing. CONICS is a software tool for mapping gene expression from scRNA-seq to tumor clones and phylogenies, with routines enabling: the quantitation of copy-number alterations in scRNA-seq, robust separation of neoplastic cells from tumor-infiltrating stroma, inter-clone differential-expression analysis and intra-clone co-expression analysis.","authors":["Muller S.","Cho A.","Liu S.J.","Lim D.A.","Diaz A."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty316","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"CONICS integrates scRNA-seq with DNA sequencing to map gene expression to tumor sub-clones","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:conics","biotoolsID":"conics","description":"Integrates scRNA-seq with DNA sequencing to map gene expression to tumor sub-clones.","homepage":"https://github.com/diazlab/CONICS","name":"CONICS"}}
