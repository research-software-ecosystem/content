description: This package provides functions for the integrated analysis of protein-protein
  interaction networks and the detection of functional modules. Different datasets
  can be integrated into the network by assigning p-values of statistical tests to
  the nodes of the network. E.g. p-values obtained from the differential expression
  of the genes from an Affymetrix array are assigned to the nodes of the network.
  By fitting a beta-uniform mixture model and calculating scores from the p-values,
  overall scores of network regions can be calculated and an integer linear programming
  algorithm identifies the maximum scoring subnetwork.
