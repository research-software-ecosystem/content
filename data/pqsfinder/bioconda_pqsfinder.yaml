description: Pqsfinder detects DNA and RNA sequence patterns that are likely to fold
  into an intramolecular G-quadruplex (G4). Unlike many other approaches, pqsfinder
  is able to detect G4s folded from imperfect G-runs containing bulges or mismatches
  or G4s having long loops. Pqsfinder also assigns an integer score to each hit that
  was fitted on G4 sequencing data and corresponds to expected stability of the folded
  G4.
