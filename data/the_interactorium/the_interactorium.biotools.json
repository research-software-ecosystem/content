                "abstract": "We confirmed that date and party hubs have different topological properties, with the coordinating role of date hubs being supported by a greater impact on CPL. We also confirmed that date hubs participate in more genetic interactions and evolve more rapidly than party hubs. These observations, as well as the identity of the nodes considered as date and party, remained largely consistent within all tested networks (HC, filtered-HC, HCfyi), demonstrating the robustness of the results originally observed in [2]. Thus, this updated analysis confirms the validity of the distinction between date and party hubs in the yeast interactome [2,3], and shows that the date and party hub concept and the \"stratus-like\" network [1] model are not mutually exclusive. \u00a9 2007 Bertin et al.",
