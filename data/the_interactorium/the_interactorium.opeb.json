We also confirmed that date hubs participate in more genetic interactions and evolve more rapidly than party hubs. These observations, as well as the identity of the nodes considered as date and party, remained largely consistent within all tested networks (HC, filtered-HC, HCfyi), demonstrating the robustness of the results originally observed in [2]. Thus, this updated analysis confirms the validity of the distinction between date and party hubs in the yeast interactome [2,3], and shows that the date and party hub concept and the \"stratus-like\" network [1] model are not mutually exclusive. © 2007 Bertin et al.","authors":["Bertin N.","Simonis N.","Dupuy D.","Cusick M.E.","Han J.-D.J.","Fraser H.B.","Roth F.P.","Vidal M."],"cit_count":67,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pbio.0050153","journal":"PLoS Biology","title":"Confirmation of organized modularity in the yeast interactome","type":"Primary","year":"2007-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:the_interactorium","biotoolsID":"the_interactorium","description":"Platform built to visualise very large interactome datasets.
