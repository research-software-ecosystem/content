                "abstract": "\u00a9 2021 American Chemical Society.Metaproteomics by mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful approach to profile a large number of proteins expressed by all organisms in a highly complex biological or ecological sample, which is able to provide a direct and quantitative assessment of the functional makeup of a microbiota. The human gastrointestinal microbiota has been found playing important roles in human physiology and health, and metaproteomics has been shown to shed light on multiple novel associations between microbiota and diseases. MS-powered proteomics generally relies on genome data to define search space. However, metaproteomics, which simultaneously analyzes all proteins from hundreds to thousands of species, faces significant challenges regarding database search and interpretation of results. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a user-friendly microbiome analysis pipeline (MAPLE, freely downloadable at http://maple.rx.umaryland.edu/), which is able to define an optimal search space by inferring proteomes specific to samples following the principle of parsimony. MAPLE facilitates highly comparable or better peptide identification compared to a sample-specific metagenome-guided search. In addition, we implemented an automated peptide-centric enrichment analysis function in MAPLE to address issues of traditional protein-centric comparison, enabling straightforward and comprehensive comparison of taxonomic and functional makeup between microbiota.",
