Taxallnomy is based on the NCBI Taxonomy, thus you will find along the taxonomic lineage either taxa originally ranked in NCBI Taxonomy or some unique nodes created by the Taxallnomy algorithm, since some taxonomic ranks are missing in the original taxonomic lineage (for example, the Superclass rank is missing on the Homo sapiens lineage).\n\nTaxallnomy is a taxonomic database based on NCBI Taxonomy that provides taxonomic lineages according to the ranks used on Linnean classification system (e.g. Kingdom, Phylum, Class etc.).\n\nTaxallnomy is an extension of NCBI Taxonomy in which all taxa comprising it are organized in a balanced hierarchy, i.e all leaf (end) nodes are in the same hierarchical level.",
