Background: Computational prediction of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in different cell types is challenging. Recent technology development allows us to determine the genome-wide chromatin accessibility in various cellular and developmental contexts. The chromatin accessibility profiles provide useful information in prediction of TF binding events in various physiological conditions. Furthermore, ChIP-Seq analysis was used to determine genome-wide binding sites for a range of different TFs in multiple cell types. Integration of these two types of genomic information can improve the prediction of TF binding events. Results: We assessed to what extent a model built upon on other TFs and/or other cell types could be used to predict the binding sites of TFs of interest. A random forest model was built using a set of cell type-independent features such as specific sequences recognized by the TFs and evolutionary conservation, as well as cell type-specific features derived from chromatin accessibility data. Our analysis suggested that the models learned from other TFs and/or cell lines performed almost as well as the model learned from the target TF in the cell type of interest. Interestingly, models based on multiple TFs performed better than single-TF models. Finally, we proposed a universal model, BPAC, which was generated using ChIP-Seq data from multiple TFs in various cell types. Conclusion: Integrating chromatin accessibility information with sequence information improves prediction of TF binding.The prediction of TF binding is transferable across TFs and/or cell lines suggesting there are a set of universal \"rules\". A computational tool was developed to predict TF binding sites based on the universal \"rules\".", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Liu S."}, {"name": "Zibetti C."}, {"name": "Wan J."}, {"name": "Wang G."}, {"name": "Blackshaw S."}, {"name": "Qian J."}], "date": "2017-07-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jiang Qian", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jiang.qian@jhmi.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bpac", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/BPAC/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Transcription factor binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0445"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predict of transcription factor binding sites based on chromatin accessibility.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "bpac", "additionDate": "2018-08-12T10:39:15Z", "name": "BPAC", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinfo.wilmer.jhu.edu/BPAC/FAQ.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
