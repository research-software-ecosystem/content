Their quantification and analysis have applications in fields from population genetics to evolutionary biology. As genome assemblies become commonplace, the need for software that can facilitate analyses has never been greater. In particular, R packages that can analyze genomic data are particularly important since this is one of the most popular software environments for biologists. We created an R package, micRocounter, to quantify microsatellites. We have optimized our package for speed, accessibility, and portability, making the automated analysis of large genomic data sets feasible. Computationally intensive algorithms were built in C++ to increase speed. Tests using benchmark datasets show a 200-fold improvement in speed over existing software. A moderately sized genome of 500 Mb can be processed in under 50 sec. Results are output as an object in R increasing accessibility and flexibility for practitioners.",
