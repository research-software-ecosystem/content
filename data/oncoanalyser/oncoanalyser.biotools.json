    "description": "Oncoanalyser is an nf-core Nextflow implementation of the tools developed by Hartwig Medical Foundation. The workflow is designed to comprehensively detect all variant types (SNV. MNV, InDel, SV, CNV, Fusions, Viral insertions, Telomere length, Genetic Immune Escape, mutational processes) as well as key tumor characteristics (purity, ploidy, TMB, MSI) from data derived from different short read platforms. The tooling is optimised for paired whole genome samples (90x tumor, 30x normal) but can be run on exome or panel (targeted) data. There is support for GRCh37 and GRCh38 human reference genome builds.",
