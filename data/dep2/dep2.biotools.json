                "abstract": "Mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics has become the most powerful approach to study the proteome of given biological and clinical samples. Advancements in sample preparation and MS detection have extended the application of proteomics but have also brought new demands on data analysis. Appropriate proteomics data analysis workflow mainly requires quality control, hypothesis testing, functional mining, and visualization. Although there are numerous tools for each process, an efficient and universal tandem analysis toolkit to obtain a quick overall view of various proteomics data is still urgently needed. Here, we present DEP2, an updated version of DEP we previously established, for proteomics data analysis. We amended the analysis workflow by incorporating alternative approaches to accommodate diverse proteomics data, introducing peptide-protein summarization and coupling biological function exploration. In summary, DEP2 is a well-rounded toolkit designed for protein- and peptide-level quantitative proteomics data. It features a more flexible differential analysis workflow and includes a user-friendly Shiny application to facilitate data analysis.",
