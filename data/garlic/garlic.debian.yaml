description: "Garlic is written for the investigation of membrane proteins. It may\
  \ be used to visualize other proteins, as well as some geometric objects. This version\
  \ of garlic recognizes PDB format version 2.1. Garlic may also be used to analyze\
  \ protein sequences. . It only depends on the X libraries, no other libraries are\
  \ needed. . Features include:\n - The slab position and thickness are visible in\
  \ a small window.\n - Atomic bonds as well as atoms are treated as independent drawable\n\
  \   objects.\n - The atomic and bond colors depend on position. Five mapping modes\n\
  \   are available (as for slab).\n - Capable to display stereo image.\n - Capable\
  \ to display other geometric objects, like membrane.\n - Atomic information is available\
  \ for atom covered by the mouse\n   pointer. No click required, just move the mouse\
  \ pointer over the\n   structure!\n - Capable to load more than one structure.\n\
  \ - Capable to draw Ramachandran plot, helical wheel, Venn diagram,\n   averaged\
  \ hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment plot.\n - The command prompt is available\
  \ at the bottom of the main window.\n   It is able to display one error message\
  \ and one command string.\n"
