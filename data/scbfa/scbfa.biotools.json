    "description": "modeling detection patterns to mitigate technical noise in large-scale single-cell genomics data | A dimensionality reduction tool using gene detection pattern to mitigate noisy expression profile of scRNA-seq | This package is designed to model gene detection pattern of scRNA-seq through a binary factor analysis model. This model allows user to pass into a cell level covariate matrix X and gene level covariate matrix Q to account for nuisance variance(e.g batch effect), and it will output a low dimensional embedding matrix for downstream analysis | Binary Factor Analysis: a dimensionality reduction tool for noisy, high throughput single cell genomic data | Single cell Binary Factor Analysis (scBFA) and Binary PCA - These are tools for performing dimensionality reduction in large scRNA-seq datasets, as described in: Li, R., Quon, G. (2018) Gene detection models outperform gene expression for large-scale scRNA-seq analysis. bioRxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/454629",

We show that this technical variation in both scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets can be mitigated by analyzing feature detection patterns alone and ignoring feature quantification measurements. This result holds when datasets have low detection noise relative to quantification noise. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of detection pattern models using our new framework, scBFA, for both cell type identification and trajectory inference. Performance gains can also be realized in one line of R code in existing pipelines.",
