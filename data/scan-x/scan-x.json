We describe a protocol to use the scan-x Web site to view predicted acetylation sites in the human proteome and predicted phosphorylation sites in the human, mouse, fly, and yeast proteomes with high specificity. This tool is accessible from virtually any computer with a Web browser. The only requirement is a means of searching for a protein of interest in one of the represented organisms. \u00a9 2011 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
