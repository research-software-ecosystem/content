This study is aimed at identifying circulation miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers in colon cancer. Methods:We conducted a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) in miRNAs to find out the expression pattern among circulation miRNAs by using a \"WGCNA\" package in R. Correlation analysis was performed to find cancer-related modules. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) in colon cancer were identified by a \"limma\" package in R. Hub gene analysis was conducted for these DEmiRs in the cancer-related modules by the \"closeness\" method in cytoscape software.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'WGCNA' (bio.tools/wgcna)","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31871878","name":"DEmiRs"}}
