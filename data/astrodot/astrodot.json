    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AstroStat', 'Gfap', 'Gfap ', 'Gfap a Gfap' | a new method for studying the spatial distribution of mRNA in astrocytes | Abstract Cells with a complex shape often use mRNA distribution and local translation to regulate distal functions. These mechanisms have recently been described in astrocytes, the processes of which contact and functionally modulate neighbouring synapses and blood vessels. In order to study the distribution of mRNA in astrocytes, we developed a three-dimensional histological method that combines mRNA detection via in situ hybridization with immunostaining of the astrocyte-specific intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Three-dimensional confocal images were analyzed using AstroDot, a custom Image J plug-in developed in-house for the identification and quantification of mRNAs in GFAP-immunolabelled astrocyte somata, large processes and fine processes",
