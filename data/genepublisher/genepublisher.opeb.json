Raw data are uploaded to the server together with a specification of the data. The server performs normalization, statistical analysis and visualization of the data. The results are run against databases of signal transduction pathways, metabolic pathways and promoter sequences in order to extract more information. The results of the entire analysis are summarized in report form and returned to the user.","authors":["Knudsen S.","Workman C.","Sicheritz-Ponten T.","Friis C."],"cit_count":28,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkg629","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"GenePublisher: Automated analysis of DNA microarray data","type":"Primary","year":"2003-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:genepublisher","biotoolsID":"genepublisher","description":"Automated data analysis from gene expression experiments on a number of different platforms.","homepage":"http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/GenePublisher/","name":"GenePublisher","version":["1.03"]}}
