  "sc:description": "This is an in-house code of the FORTH/ICE-HT Laboratory of Simulation of Advanced Materials and Processes, Patras, Greece, providing a reliable 3D reconstruction and simulation of a membrane bioreactor for lactose hydrolysis with immobilized enzymes. The membrane model is coupled to a macroscopic model of a single membrane fiber unit to produce lactose concentration profiles, lactose consumption predictions, and performance index estimates.",
