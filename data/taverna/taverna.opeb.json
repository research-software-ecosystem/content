These pipelines can be executed on local desktop machines or through larger infrastructure (such as supercomputers, Grids or cloud environments), using the Taverna Server. In bioinformatics, Taverna workflows are typically used in the areas of high-throughput omics analyses (for example, proteomics or transcriptomics), or for evidence gathering methods involving text mining or data mining. Through Taverna, scientists have access to several thousand different tools and resources that are freely available from a large range of life science institutions. Once constructed, the workflows are reusable, executable bioinformatics protocols that can be shared, reused and repurposed. A repository of public workflows is available at http://www.myexperiment.org. This article provides an update to the Taverna tool suite, highlighting new features and developments in the workbench and the Taverna Server.","authors":["Wolstencroft K.","Haines R.","Fellows D.","Williams A.","Withers D.","Owen S.","Soiland-Reyes S.","Dunlop I.","Nenadic A.","Fisher P.","Bhagat J.","Belhajjame K.","Bacall F.","Hardisty A.","Nieva de la Hidalga A.","Balcazar Vargas M.P.","Sufi S.","Goble C."],"cit_count":348,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23640334","title":"The Taverna workflow suite: designing and executing workflows of Web Services on the desktop, web or in the cloud.","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:taverna","biotoolsID":"taverna","description":"An open source and domain-independent Workflow Management System – a suite of tools used to design and execute scientific workflows and aid in silico experimentation.","homepage":"https://taverna.incubator.apache.org/","name":"Taverna","version":["3.1.0"]}}
