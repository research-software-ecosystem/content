    "description": "Measuring significant changes in chromatin conformation with ACCOST | Abstract Chromatin conformation assays such as Hi-C cannot directly measure differences in 3D architecture between cell types or cell states. For this purpose, two or more Hi-C experiments must be carried out, but direct comparison of the resulting Hi-C matrices is confounded by several features of Hi-C data. Most notably, the genomic distance effect, whereby contacts between pairs of genomic loci that are proximal along the chromosome exhibit many more Hi-C contacts that distal pairs of loci, dominates every Hi-C matrix. Furthermore, the form that this distance effect takes often varies between different Hi-C experiments, even between replicate experiments. Thus, a statistical confidence measure designed to identify differential Hi-C contacts must accurately account for the genomic distance effect or risk being misled by large-scale but artifactual differences",
