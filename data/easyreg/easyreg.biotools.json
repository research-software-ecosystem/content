                "abstract": "Volumetric registration of brain MRI is routinely used in human neuroimaging, e.g., to align different MRI modalities, to measure change in longitudinal analysis, to map an individual to a template, or in registration-based segmentation. Classical registration techniques based on numerical optimization have been very successful in this domain, and are implemented in widespread software suites like ANTs, Elastix, NiftyReg, or DARTEL. Over the last 7–8 years, learning-based techniques have emerged, which have a number of advantages like high computational efficiency, potential for higher accuracy, easy integration of supervision, and the ability to be part of a meta-architectures. However, their adoption in neuroimaging pipelines has so far been almost inexistent. Reasons include: lack of robustness to changes in MRI modality and resolution; lack of robust affine registration modules; lack of (guaranteed) symmetry; and, at a more practical level, the requirement of deep learning expertise that may be lacking at neuroimaging research sites. Here, we present EasyReg, an open-source, learning-based registration tool that can be easily used from the command line without any deep learning expertise or specific hardware. EasyReg combines the features of classical registration tools, the capabilities of modern deep learning methods, and the robustness to changes in MRI modality and resolution provided by our recent work in domain randomization. As a result, EasyReg is: fast; symmetric; diffeomorphic (and thus invertible); agnostic to MRI modality and resolution; compatible with affine and nonlinear registration; and does not require any preprocessing or parameter tuning. We present results on challenging registration tasks, showing that EasyReg is as accurate as classical methods when registering 1 mm isotropic scans within MRI modality, but much more accurate across modalities and resolutions. EasyReg is publicly available as part of FreeSurfer; see https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/EasyReg.",
