This mechanism has been found to participate in gene regulation and a wide spectrum of biological processes. However, the evolutionary and regulatory origins of NMD-targeted transcripts (NMDTs) have been less studied, partly because of the complexity in analyzing NMD events. Here we report NMD Classifier, a tool for systematic classification of NMD events for either annotated or de novo assembled transcripts. This tool is based on the assumption of minimal evolution/regulation-an event that leads to the least change is the most likely to occur. Our simulation results indicate that NMD Classifier can correctly identify an average of 99.3% of the NMD-causing transcript structural changes, particularly exon inclusions/ exclusions and exon boundary alterations. Researchers can apply NMD Classifier to evolutionary and regulatory studies by comparing NMD events of different biological conditions or in different organisms.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Hsu M.-K."}, {"name": "Lin H.-Y."}, {"name": "Chen F.-C."}], "date": "2017-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Feng-Chi Chen", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "fcchen@nhri.org.tw"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:nmd_classifier", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/transcriptome-analysis/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2990"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for systematic classification of nonsense mediated decay (NMD) events.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "nmd_classifier", "additionDate": "2018-06-06T18:47:04Z", "name": "NMD classifier", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
