However, most data are currently not readily accessible to the biologist at a single site, but scattered over multiple online repositories. Therefore, we have developed the DASMIweb server that affords the integration, analysis and qualitative assessment of distributed sources of interaction data in a dynamic fashion. Since DASMIweb allows for querying many different resources of protein and domain interactions simultaneously, it serves as an important starting point for interactome studies and assists the user in finding publicly accessible interaction data with minimal effort. The pool of queried resources is fully configurable and supports the inclusion of own interaction data or confidence scores. In particular, DASMIweb integrates confidence measures like functional similarity scores to assess individual interactions. The retrieved results can be exported in different file formats like MITAB or SIF. DASMIweb is freely available at http://www.dasmiweb.de.","authors":["Blankenburg H.","Ramirez F.","Buch J.","Albrecht M."],"cit_count":2,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"19502495","title":"DASMIweb: Online integration, analysis and assessment of distributed protein interaction data","year":"2009-08-04"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dasmiweb","biotoolsID":"dasmiweb","description":"Server that allows integration, analysis and quantitative assessment of distributed sources of protein and domain interactions.
