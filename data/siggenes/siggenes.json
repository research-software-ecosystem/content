Since these studies often comprise the genotypes of hundreds of thousands of SNPs, methods are required that can cope with the corresponding multiple testing problem. For the analysis of gene expression data, approaches such as the empirical Bayes analysis of microarrays have been developed particularly for the detection of genes associated with the response. However, the empirical Bayes analysis of microarrays has only been suggested for binary responses when considering expression values, i.e. continuous predictors. Results: In this paper, we propose a modification of this empirical Bayes analysis that can be used to analyze high-dimensional categorical SNP data. This approach along with a generalized version of the original empirical Bayes method are available in the R package siggenes version 1.10.0 and later that can be downloaded from http://www.bioconductor.org. Conclusion: As applications to two subsets of the HapMap data show, the empirical Bayes analysis of microarrays cannot only be used to analyze continuous gene expression data, but also be applied to categorical SNP data, where the response is not restricted to be binary. In association studies in which typically several ten to a few hundred SNPs are considered, our approach can furthermore be employed to test interactions of SNPs. Moreover, the posterior probabilities resulting from the empirical Bayes analysis of (prespecified) interactions/ genotypes can also be used to quantify the importance of these interactions. \u00a9 2008 Schwender and Ickstadt; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Schwender H."}, {"name": "Ickstadt K."}], "date": "2008-03-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Holger Schwender", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "holger.schw@gmx.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:siggenes", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.48.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/siggenes.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Differential gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3223"}, {"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Identification of differentially expressed genes and estimation of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) using both the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and the Empirical Bayes Analyses of Microarrays (EBAM).", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "siggenes", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:02:39Z", "name": "siggenes", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/siggenes.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
