Despite increased awareness of interdisciplinary training in bioinformatics, many biologists still find it difficult to create their own computational solutions. VECT, the Visual Extraction and Conversion Tool, has been developed to assist nonprogrammers to create simple bioinformatics without having to master a programming language. VECT provides a unified graphical user interface for data extraction, data conversion, output composition, and Perl code generation. Programming using VECT is achieved by visually performing the desired data extraction, conversion, and output composition tasks using some sample user data. These tasks are then compiled by VECT into an executable Perl program, which can be saved for later use and can carry out the same computation independently of VECT. VECT is released under the GNU General Public License and is freely available for all major computing platforms including Macintosh® OS X, Linux, and Microsoft® Windows® at www.complex.iastate.edu.","authors":["Chou H.-H."],"cit_count":0,"journal":"BioTechniques","pmid":"15884679","title":"VECT: An automatic visual Perl programming tool for nonprogrammers","year":"2005-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vect","biotoolsID":"vect","description":"Visual extraction conversion program that provides biomedical researches with minimal computer programming background a way to generate data extraction and conversion programs.
