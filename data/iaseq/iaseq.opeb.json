However, detecting allelic imbalance from a single ChIP-seq dataset often has low statistical power since only sequence reads mapped to heterozygote SNPs are informative for discriminating two alleles.Results: We develop a new method iASeq to address this issue by jointly analyzing multiple ChIP-seq datasets. iASeq uses a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model to learn correlation patterns of allele-specificity among multiple proteins. Using the discovered correlation patterns, the model allows one to borrow information across datasets to improve detection of allelic imbalance. Application of iASeq to 77 ChIP-seq samples from 40 ENCODE datasets and 1 genomic DNA sample in GM12878 cells reveals that allele-specificity of multiple proteins are highly correlated, and demonstrates the ability of iASeq to improve allelic inference compared to analyzing each individual dataset separately.Conclusions: iASeq illustrates the value of integrating multiple datasets in the allele-specificity inference and offers a new tool to better analyze ASB. © 2012 Wei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Wei Y.","Li X.","Wang Q.-F.","Ji H."],"cit_count":14,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2164-13-681","journal":"BMC Genomics","title":"IASeq: Integrative analysis of allele-specificity of protein-DNA interactions in multiple ChIP-seq datasets","type":"Primary","year":"2012-11-21"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:iaseq","biotoolsID":"iaseq","description":"It fits correlation motif model to multiple RNAseq or ChIPseq studies to improve detection of allele-specific events and describe correlation patterns across studies.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/iASeq.html","name":"iASeq","version":["1.18.0"]}}
