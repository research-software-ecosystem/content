  "sc:description": "Implementation of statistical solid methodology enabling the analysis of network heterogeneity from high-dimensional data. It combines several implementations of recent statistical innovations useful for estimation and comparison of networks in a heterogeneous, high-dimensional setting. We provide code for formal two-sample testing in Gaussian graphical models (Stadler and Mukherjee, 2013, 2014) and make a novel network-based clustering algorithm available (Stadler and Mukherjee, 2013).",
