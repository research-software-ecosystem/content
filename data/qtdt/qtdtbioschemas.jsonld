  "sc:description": "It provides a one-stop interface for family based tests of linkage disequilibrium. The general models are supported, and can be used to analyse quantitative or discrete traits in nuclear families, with or without parental genotypes, or extended pedigrees. In addition, QTDT can calculate exact p-values by permutation even when multiple linked polymorphisms are tested.",
