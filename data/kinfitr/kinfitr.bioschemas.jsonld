      "sc:description": "Reproducible PET Pharmacokinetic Modelling in R | ABSTRACT Quantification of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data is performed using pharmacokinetic models. There exist many models for describing this data, each of which may describe the data better or worse depending on the specific application, and there are both theoretical, practical and empirical reasons to select any one model over another. As such, effective PET modelling requires a high degree of flexibility, while effective communication of all steps taken through scientific publications is not always feasible. Reproducible research practices address these concerns, in that researchers share analysis code, and data if possible, such that all steps are recorded, allowing an independent researcher to reproduce the results and assess their veracity. In this article, I present kinfitr : a software package for performing kinetic modelling using the open-source R language, in a reproducible manner",
