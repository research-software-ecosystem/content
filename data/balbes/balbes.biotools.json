BALBES aims to integrate all components, necessary for finding a solution structure by MR, into one system. It consists of a database, scientific programs and a python pipeline. The system is automated so that it needs no user's intervention when running complicated combination of jobs such as model searching, molecular replacement and refinement.",

Using this information in macromolecular crystallography (MX) should in principle increase the efficiency of MX structure solution. This paper describes a molecular-replacement pipeline, BALBES, that makes extensive use of this repository. It uses a reorganized database taken from the PDB with multimeric as well as domain organization. A system manager written in Python controls the workflow of the process. Testing the current version of the pipeline using entries from the PDB has shown that this approach has huge potential and that around 75% of structures can be solved automatically without user intervention. \u00a9 International Union of Crystallography 2008.",
