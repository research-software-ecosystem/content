Published by Oxford University Press.Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the first domesticated grain crops and represents the fourth most important cereal source for human and animal consumption. BarleyVarDB is a database of barley genomic variation. It can be publicly accessible through the website at http://146.118.64.11/BarleyVar. This database mainly provides three sets of information. First, there are 57 754 224 single nuclear polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 600 663 insertions or deletions (InDels) included in BarleyVarDB, which were identified from high-coverage whole genome sequencing of 21 barley germplasm, including 8 wild barley accessions from 3 barley evolutionary original centers and 13 barley landraces from different continents. Second, it uses the latest barley genome reference and its annotation information publicly accessible, which has been achieved by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium (IBSC). Third, 522 212 whole genome-wide microsatellites/simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also included in this database, which were identified in the reference barley pseudo-molecular genome sequence. Additionally, several useful web-based applications are provided including JBrowse, BLAST and Primer3. Users can design PCR primers to asses polymorphic variants deposited in this database and use a user-friendly interface for accessing the barley reference genome. We envisage that the BarleyVarDB will benefit the barley genetic research community by providing access to all publicly available barley genomic variation information and barley reference genome as well as providing them with an ultra-high density of SNP and InDel markers for molecular breeding and identification of functional genes with important agronomic traits in barley.
