However, rice actually has two opposite functions related to methane: i) emission enhancement, such as by providing emission pathways (aerenchyma) and methanogenetic substrates; and ii) emission suppression by providing oxygen pathways, which suppress methanogenesis or enhance methane oxidation. The overall role of rice is thus determined by the balance between its enhancing and suppressing functions","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31372208","name":"methane emissions high-emitting paddies"}}
