IREs are cis-acting regulatory motifs present in mRNAs that encode proteins involved in iron metabolism. They function as binding sites for two related trans-acting factors, namely the IRP-1 and -2. Among cis-acting RNA regulatory elements, the IRE is one of the best characterized. It is defined by a combination of RNA sequence and structure. However, currently available programs to predict IREs do not show a satisfactory level of sensitivity and fail to detect some of the functional IREs. Here, we report an improved software for the prediction of IREs implemented as a user-friendly web server tool. The SIREs web server uses a simple data input interface and provides structure analysis, predicted RNA folds, folding energy data and an overall quality flag based on properties of well characterized IREs. Results are reported in a tabular format and as a schematic visual representation that highlights important features of the IRE. The SIREs (Search for iron-responsive elements) web server is freely available on the web at http://ccbg.imppc.org/sires/index.html. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.
