  "sc:description": "This web-server is according to its genetic codes by combining its trinucleotide composition (TNC) and the pseudo amino acid components (PseAAC) of the protein translated from the DNA sample. And by means of the approach of optimizing training datasets for predicting DNA methylation sites. Rigorous cross-validations on a set of experiment-confirmed datasets have indicated that these new predictors remarkably outperformed their counterparts in the existing prediction methods.",
