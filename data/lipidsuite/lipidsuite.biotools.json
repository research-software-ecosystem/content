Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Advances in mass spectrometry enabled high throughput profiling of lipids but differential analysis and biological interpretation of lipidomics datasets remains challenging. To overcome this barrier, we present LipidSuite, an end-to-end differential lipidomics data analysis server. LipidSuite offers a step-by-step workflow for preprocessing, exploration, differential analysis and enrichment analysis of untargeted and targeted lipidomics. Three lipidomics data formats are accepted for upload: mwTab file from Metabolomics Workbench, Skyline CSV Export, and a numerical matrix. Experimental variables to be used in analysis are uploaded in a separate file. Conventional lipid names are automatically parsed to enable lipid class and chain length analyses. Users can interactively explore data, choose subsets based on sample types or lipid classes or characteristics, and conduct univariate, multivariate and unsupervised analyses. For complex experimental designs and clinical cohorts, LipidSuite offers confounding variables adjustment. Finally, data tables and plots can be both interactively viewed or downloaded for publication or reports. Overall, we anticipate this free, user-friendly webserver to facilitate differential lipidomics data analysis and re-analysis, and fully harness biological interpretation from lipidomics datasets. LipidSuite is freely available at http://suite.lipidr.org.",
