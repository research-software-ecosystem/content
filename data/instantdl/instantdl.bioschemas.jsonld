InstantDL offers the four most common tasks in medical image processing: Semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, pixel-wise regression and classification. For more in depth discussion on the methods, as well as comparing the results and bechmarks using this package, please refer to our preprint on bioRxiv here.",
