  "sc:description": "SeqSite is an efficient and easy-to-use software tool implementing a novel method for identifying and pinpointing transcription factor binding sites. It first detects transcription factor binding regions by clustering tags and statistical hypothesis testing, and locates every binding site in detected binding regions by modeling the tag profiles. It can pinpoint closely spaced adjacent binding sites from ChIP-seq data. This software is coded in C/C++, and supports major computer platforms.",
