The Riboswitch finder analyses a given sequence using the web interface, checks specific sequence elements and secondary structure, calculates and displays the energy folding of the RNA structure and runs a number of tests including this information to determine whether high-sensitivity riboswitch motifs (or variants) according to the Bacillus subtilis type are present in the given RNA sequence. Batch-mode determination (all sequences input at once and separated by FASTA format) is also possible.
