description: 'Program to model and detect macromolecular systems, genetic pathways...
  in protein datasets. in prokaryotes, these systems have often evolutionarily conserved
  properties: they are made of conserved components, and are encoded in compact loci
  (conserved genetic architecture). the user models these systems to reflect these
  conserved features, and to allow their efficient detection.'
