It contains 3848 peptide entries collected from 11 databases and 835 published research articles. Each entry provides comprehensive information about a peptide that includes its sequence, functional information, source, physicochemical properties, tertiary structure, etc. These peptides have been collected and complied from published databases and research articles. On the basis of their activities, we classified the peptides in 9 categories. Detailed information of these categories and sub-categories can be found on statistics page.",
