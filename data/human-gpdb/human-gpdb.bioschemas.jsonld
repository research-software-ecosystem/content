The database currently holds information about 713 human GPCRs, 36 human G-Proteins and 99 human Effectors. The collection of the information about the interactions between these molecules was done manually and the current status of Human-gpDB reveals information about 1663 connections between GPCRs and G-Proteins and 1618 connections between G-Proteins and Effectors. The sequences of G-Proteins and GPCRs are classified according to a hierarchy of different classes, families and sub-families, whereas the Effectors sequences are classified in families, subfamilies and types, based on extensive literature search. The classification of GPCRs follows the IUPHAR classification, while the Effectors classification is a unique feature and is based on their function.",
