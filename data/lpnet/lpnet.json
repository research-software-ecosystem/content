    "description": "This tool aims at infering biological networks, in particular signaling and gene networks. For that it takes perturbation data, either steady-state or time-series, as input and generates an LP model which allows the inference of signaling networks. For parameter identification either leave-one-out cross-validation or stratified n-fold cross-validation can be used.",

Summary: With the widespread availability of high-throughput experimental technologies it has become possible to study hundreds to thousands of cellular factors simultaneously, such as coding- or non-coding mRNA or protein concentrations. Still, extracting information about the underlying regulatory or signaling interactions from these data remains a difficult challenge. We present a flexible approach towards network inference based on linear programming. Our method reconstructs the interactions of factors from a combination of perturbation/non-perturbation and steady-state/time-series data. We show both on simulated and real data that our methods are able to reconstruct the underlying networks fast and efficiently, thus shedding new light on biological processes and, in particular, into disease's mechanisms of action. We have implemented the approach as an R package available through bioconductor.",
