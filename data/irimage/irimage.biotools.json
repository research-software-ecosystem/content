                "abstract": "IRimage aims at increasing throughput, accuracy and reproducibility of results obtained from thermal images, especially those produced with affordable, consumer-oriented cameras. IRimage processes thermal images, extracting raw data and calculating temperature values with an open and fully documented algorithm, making this data available for further processing using image analysis software. It also allows the making of reproducible measurements of the temperature of objects in a series of images, and produce visual outputs (images and videos) suitable for scientific reporting. IRimage is implemented in a scripting language of the scientific image analysis software ImageJ, allowing its use through a graphical user interface and also allowing for an easy modification or expansion of its functionality. IRimage’s results were consistent with those of standard software for 15 camera models of the most widely used brand. An example use case is also presented, in which IRimage was used to efficiently process hundreds of thermal images to reveal subtle differences in the daily pattern of leaf temperature of plants subjected to different soil water contents. IRimage’s functionalities make it better suited for research purposes than many currently available alternatives, and could contribute to making affordable consumer-grade thermal cameras useful for reproducible research.",
