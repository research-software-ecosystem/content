Submitted sequences are aligned to each of about 3000 templates with a conventional dynamic programming algorithm, but using a score function with sophisticated structure and sequence terms. The structure terms are a log-odds probability of sequence to structure fragment compatibility, obtained from a Bayesian classification procedure. A simplex optimization was used to optimize the sequence-based terms for the goal of alignment and model quality and to balance the sequence and structural contributions against each other. Both sequence and structural terms operate with sequence profiles. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Torda A.E.","Procter J.B.","Huber T."],"cit_count":35,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15215443","title":"Wurst: A Protein threading server with a structural scoring function, sequence profiles and optimized substitution matrices","year":"2004-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:wurst","biotoolsID":"wurst","description":"Wurst is a protein structure prediction tool that uses threading, aligning submitted sequences to thousands of PDB template structures.","homepage":"http://www.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/wurst/","name":"Wurst"}}
