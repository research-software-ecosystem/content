      "sc:description": "identifying protein positions for variation driven functional tuning.\n\nEvaluating the impact of non-synonymous genetic variants is essential for uncovering disease associations and mechanisms of evolution. An in-depth understanding of sequence changes is also fundamental for synthetic protein design and stability assessments. However, the variant effect predictor performance gain observed in recent years has not kept up with the increased complexity of new methods. One likely reason for this might be that most approaches use similar sets of gene and protein features for modeling variant effects, often emphasizing sequence conservation. While high levels of conservation highlight residues essential for protein activity, much of the variation observable in vivo is arguably weaker in its impact, thus requiring evaluation at a higher level of resolution",
