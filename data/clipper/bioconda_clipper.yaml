biotools_id: clipper
description: Implements topological gene set analysis using a two-step empirical approach.
  It exploits graph decomposition theory to create a junction tree and reconstruct
  the most relevant signal path. In the first step clipper selects significant pathways
  according to statistical tests on the means and the concentration matrices of the
  graphs derived from pathway topologies. Then, it "clips" the whole pathway identifying
  the signal paths having the greatest association with a specific phenotype.
