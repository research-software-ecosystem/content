The recent advancements in next generation sequencing (NGS) have led to a wide dissemination of sequencing technologies and data, to highly diverse research groups. It is expected that clinical sequencing will become part of diagnostic routines shortly. However, limited accessibility to computational infrastructure and high quality bioinformatic tools, and the demand for personnel skilled in data analysis and interpretation remains a serious bottleneck. To this end, the cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technologies can help address these issues. We successfully enabled the Atlas2 Cloud pipeline for personal genome analysis on two different cloud service platforms: a community cloud via the Genboree Workbench, and a commercial cloud via the Amazon Web Services using Software-as-a-Service model. We report a case study of personal genome analysis using our Atlas2 Genboree pipeline. We also outline a detailed cost structure for running Atlas2 Amazon on whole exome capture data, providing cost projections in terms of storage, compute and I/O when running Atlas2 Amazon on a large data set. We find that providing a web interface and an optimized pipeline clearly facilitates usage of cloud computing for personal genome analysis, but for it to be routinely used for large scale projects there needs to be a paradigm shift in the way we develop tools, in standard operating procedures, and in funding mechanisms.", "citationCount": 26, "authors": [{"name": "Evani U.S."}, {"name": "Challis D."}, {"name": "Yu J."}, {"name": "Jackson A.R."}, {"name": "Paithankar S."}, {"name": "Bainbridge M.N."}, {"name": "Jakkamsetti A."}, {"name": "Pham P."}, {"name": "Coarfa C."}, {"name": "Milosavljevic A."}, {"name": "Yu F."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Fuli Yu, Ph.D.", "url": "http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "fyu@bcm.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:atlas2", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/software/atlas-2", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Exome assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3229"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2429"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-08T10:27:29Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Next-generation sequencing suite of variant analysis tools specializing in the separation of true SNPs and insertions and deletions (indels) from sequencing and mapping errors in Whole Exome Capture Sequencing (WECS) data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/atlas2-1-4-3-atlas2cloud-0-5-genome-analysis-suite.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}, {"url": "https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/software/atlas-2", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "atlas2", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:32Z", "name": "Atlas2", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/software/atlas-2", "note": null, "type": "General"}, {"url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/atlas2/files/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
