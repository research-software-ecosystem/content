    "description": "a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries | Glyco-DIA is a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries | The Glyco-DIA library consists of sublibraries obtained from human cell lines and human serum, and it currently covers 2,076 O-glycoproteins (11,452 unique glycopeptide sequences) and the five most common core1 O-glycan structures. Applying the Glyco-DIA library to human serum without enrichment for glycopeptides enabled us to identify and quantify 269 distinct glycopeptide sequences bearing up to 5 different core1 O-glycans from 159 glycoproteins in a singleshot analysis. The DIA method is expandable and widely applicable to different glycoproteomes, and it may represent a first step towards direct and comprehensive approach to glycoproteomics",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.We report a liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry O-glycoproteomics strategy using data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode for direct analysis of O-glycoproteins. This approach enables characterization of glycopeptides and structures of O-glycans on a proteome-wide scale with quantification of stoichiometries (though it does not allow for direct unambiguous glycosite identification). The method relies on a spectral library of O-glycopeptides; the Glyco-DIA library contains sublibraries obtained from human cell lines and human serum, and it currently covers 2,076 O-glycoproteins (11,452 unique glycopeptide sequences) and the 5 most common core1 O-glycan structures. Applying the Glyco-DIA library to human serum without enrichment for glycopeptides enabled us to identify and quantify 269 distinct glycopeptide sequences bearing up to 5 different core1 O-glycans from 159 glycoproteins in a SingleShot analysis.",
