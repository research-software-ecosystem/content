This approach enables characterization of glycopeptides and structures of O-glycans on a proteome-wide scale with quantification of stoichiometries (though it does not allow for direct unambiguous glycosite identification). The method relies on a spectral library of O-glycopeptides; the Glyco-DIA library contains sublibraries obtained from human cell lines and human serum, and it currently covers 2,076 O-glycoproteins (11,452 unique glycopeptide sequences) and the 5 most common core1 O-glycan structures. Applying the Glyco-DIA library to human serum without enrichment for glycopeptides enabled us to identify and quantify 269 distinct glycopeptide sequences bearing up to 5 different core1 O-glycans from 159 glycoproteins in a SingleShot analysis.","authors":["Ye Z.","Mao Y.","Clausen H.","Vakhrushev S.Y."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1038/S41592-019-0504-X","journal":"Nature Methods","pmid":"31384044","title":"Glyco-DIA: a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries","year":"2019-09-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Glyco-DIA","biotoolsID":"Glyco-DIA","description":"a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries | Glyco-DIA is a method for quantitative O-glycoproteomics with in silico-boosted glycopeptide libraries | The Glyco-DIA library consists of sublibraries obtained from human cell lines and human serum, and it currently covers 2,076 O-glycoproteins (11,452 unique glycopeptide sequences) and the five most common core1 O-glycan structures.
