    "description": "Computer-assisted craniometric evaluation for diagnosis and follow-up of craniofacial asymmetries.\n\nPurpose: The current assessment of patients with craniofacial asymmetries is accomplished by physical examination, anamnesis and radiological imaging. We propose a semi-automated, computer-assisted craniofacial evaluation (SymMetric v 1.0) based on orthogonal photography of the patient's head in 3 positions. The system is simple, low-cost, no-radiation or special resources needed. Although it does not substitute CT in cases of doubt between craniosynostosis and positional plagiocephaly, multiple numeric evaluations indicate regional deformities and severity of the asymmetry, which can help in the clinical decision of indicating or not the orthosis in positional deformities, determining treatment duration or evaluating surgical outcomes after correction.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'deformities', 'orthosis', 'asymmetries', 'craniofacial'",
