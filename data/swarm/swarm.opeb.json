Popular de novo amplicon clustering methods suffer from two fundamental flaws: arbitrary global clustering thresholds, and input-order dependency induced by centroid selection. Swarmwas developed to address these issues by first clustering nearly identical amplicons iteratively using a local threshold, and then by using clusters' internal structure and amplicon abundances to refine its results. This fast, scalable, and input-order independent approach reduces the influence of clustering parameters and produces robust operational taxonomic units.","authors":["Mahe F.","Rognes T.","Quince C.","de Vargas C.","Dunthorn M."],"cit_count":190,"doi":"10.7717/peerj.593","journal":"PeerJ","title":"Swarm: Robust and fast clustering method for amplicon-based studies","type":"Primary","year":"2014-01-01"},{"abstract":"© 2015 Mahé et al. Previously we presented Swarm v1, a novel and open source amplicon clustering program that produced fine-scale molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs), free of arbitrary global clustering thresholds and input-order dependency. Swarmv1 worked with an initial phase that used iterative single-linkage with a local clustering threshold (d), followed by a phase that used the internal abundance structures of clusters to break chained OTUs.Here we present Swarmv2, which has two important novel features: (1) a new algorithm for d = 1 that allows the computation time of the program to scale linearly with increasing amounts of data; and (2) the new fastidious option that reduces under-grouping by grafting low abundant OTUs (e.g., singletons and doubletons) onto larger ones. Swarm v2 also directly integrates the clustering and breaking phases, dereplicates sequencing reads with d = 0, outputs OTU representatives in fasta format, and plots individualOTUs as two-dimensional networks.","authors":["Mahe F.","Rognes T.","Quince C.","de Vargas C.","Dunthorn M."],"cit_count":80,"doi":"10.7717/peerj.1420","journal":"PeerJ","title":"Swarmv2: Highly-scalable and high-resolution amplicon clustering","type":"Other","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:swarm","biotoolsID":"swarm","description":"A robust and fast clustering method for amplicon-based studies.
