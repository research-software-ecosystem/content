    "description": "ArchSchema is a java program that generates dynamic plots of related Pfam domain architectures. The protein sequences having each architecture can be displayed on the plot and separately listed. Where there is 3D structural information in the PDB, the relevant PDB codes can be shown on the plot. Sequences can be be filtered by organism, or the output can be limited to just those protein sequences for which there is structural information in the PDB.",

                "abstract": "Summary: ArchSchema is a Java Web Start application that generates a dynamic 2D network of related Pfam domain architectures. Each node corresponds to a different architecture (shown as a sequence of coloured boxes) and indicates whether any 3D structural information is available in the PDB. Satellite nodes can show either the UniProt codes or the PDB codes of proteins having the given architecture. Search options allow search by UniProt code or Pfam domain identifier, and results can be filtered by domain, organism, or by selecting only proteins in the PDB.
