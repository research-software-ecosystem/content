Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Summary: This note presents the design of a scalable software package named ImagePy for analy-sing biological images. Our contribution is concentrated on facilitating extensibility and interoperability of the software through decoupling the data model from the user interface. Especially with assistance from the Python ecosystem, this software framework makes modern computer algorithms easier to be applied in bioimage analysis.","authors":["Wang A.","Yan X.","Wei Z."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty313","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"ImagePy: An open-source, Python-based and platform-independent software package for bioimage analysis","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:imagepy","biotoolsID":"imagepy","description":"Open-source, Python-based and platform-independent software package for bioimage analysis.","homepage":"https://github.com/Image-Py/imagepy","name":"ImagePy"}}
