A major rate limiting step in clinical interpretation is the manual curation of evidence in the genetic literature by highly trained biocurators.

In collaboration with the Clinical Genomic Resource (ClinGen)-the flagship NIH program for clinical curation-we propose the first machine learning system, LitGen, that can retrieve papers for a particular variant and filter them by specific evidence types used by curators to assess for pathogenicity. LitGen uses semi-supervised deep learning to predict the type of evi+dence provided by each paper. It is trained on papers annotated by ClinGen curators and systematically evaluated on new test data collected by ClinGen. LitGen further leverages rich human explanations and unlabeled data to gain 7.9%-12.6% relative performance improvement over models learned only on the annotated papers. It is a useful framework to improve clinical variant curation.","authors":["Nie A.","Pineda A.L.","Wright M.W.","Wand H.","Wulf B.","Costa H.A.","Patel R.Y.","Bustamante C.D.","Zou J."],"cit_count":0,"journal":"Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing.
