It allows the visual inspection of the identified motifs in relation to attenuators and open reading frames (ORFs). Any of the ORF's or regulatory elements' sequence can be obtained with a click and submitted to NCBI's BLAST. Alternatively, the genome context of all other genes regulated by the same element can be explored with our genome context tool (GeConT). RibEx is available at http://www.ibt.unam.mx/biocomputo/ribex.html. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.",
