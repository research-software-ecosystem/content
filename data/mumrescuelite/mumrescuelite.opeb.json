These tags are routinely omitted from further analysis, leading to experimental bias and reduced coverage. Here, we present MuMRescueLite, a low-resource requirement version of the MuMRescue software that has been used by several next generation sequencing projects to probabilistically reincorporate multi-mapping tags into mapped short read data. © The Author 2009.
