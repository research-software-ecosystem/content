  "sc:description": "DNA for Windows is a compact, easy to use DNA analysis program, ideal for small-scale sequencing projects.  It is particularly suited to working with chromatogram files from ABI machines, and is one of the few programs able to edit as well as view these files.  The program has powerful DNA translation and restriction enzyme analysis facilities, and works with external programs to produce multiple alignments and contigs with ease.",
