  "sc:description": "BEAP uses a short starting DNA fragment, often a EST or partial gene segment, as “primer”, to recursively blast nucleotide databases in an attempt to obtain all sequences that overlaps, directly or indirectly, with the “primer” therefore help to “extend” the length of the original sequence for constructing a “full length” sequence for functional analysis, or at least to obtain neighboring regions of the segment for SNP discovery and linkage disequilibrium analysis.",
