The TMT and iTRAQ isobaric labeling technologies allow the comparison of 2, 4, 6, or 8 samples in one mass spectrometric analysis. Sound statistical models that scale with the most advanced mass spectrometry (MS) instruments are essential for their efficient use. Through the application of robust statistical methods, we developed models that capture variability from individual spectra to biological samples. Classical experimental designs with a distinct sample in each channel as well as the use of replicates in multiple channels are integrated into a single statistical framework. We have prepared complex test samples including controlled ratios ranging from 100:1 to 1:100 to characterize the performance of our method. We demonstrate its application to actual biological data sets originating from three different laboratories and MS platforms. Finally, test data and an R package, named isobar, which can read Mascot, Phenyx, and mzIdentML files, are made available. The isobar package can also be used as an independent software that requires very little or no R programming skills. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","authors":["Breitwieser F.P.","Muller A.","Dayon L.","Kocher T.","Hainard A.","Pichler P.","Schmidt-Erfurth U.","Superti-Furga G.","Sanchez J.-C.","Mechtler K.","Bennett K.L.","Colinge J."],"cit_count":86,"doi":"10.1021/pr1012784","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","pmid":"21526793","title":"General statistical modeling of data from protein relative expression isobaric tags","type":"Primary","year":"2011-06-03"},{"abstract":"The establishment of extremely powerful proteomics platforms able to map thousands of modification sites, e.g. phosphorylations or acetylations, over entire proteomes calls for equally powerful software tools to effectively extract useful and reliable information from such complex datasets. We present a new quantitative PTM analysis platform aimed at processing iTRAQ or Tandem Mass Tags (TMT) labeled peptides. It covers a broad range of needs associated with proper PTM ratio analysis such as PTM localization validation, robust ratio computation and statistical assessment, and navigable user report generation. IsobarPTM is made available as an R Bioconductor package and it can be run from the command line by non R specialists. Biological significance: \"IsobarPTM is a new software tool facilitating the quantitative analysis of protein modification regulation streamlining important issues related to PTM localization and statistical modeling.
