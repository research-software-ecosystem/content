                "abstract": "This paper describes a web server BTEVAL, developed for assessing the performance of newly developed beta-turn prediction method and it's ranking with respect to other existing beta-turn prediction methods. Evaluation of a method can be carried out on a single protein or a number of proteins. It consists of clean data set of 426 non-homologous proteins with seven subsets of these proteins. Users can evaluate their method on any subset or a complete set of data. The method is assessed at amino acid level and performance is evaluated in terms of Qtotal, Qpredicted, Qobserved and MCC measures. The server also compares the performance of the method with other existing beta-turn prediction methods such as Chou-Fasman algorithm, Thornton's algorithm, GORBTURN, 1-4 and 2-3 Correlation model, Sequence coupled model and BTPRED. The server is accessible from http://imtech.res.in/raghava/bteval/",
