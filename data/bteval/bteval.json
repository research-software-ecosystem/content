Evaluation of a method can be carried out on a single protein or a number of proteins. It consists of clean data set of 426 non-homologous proteins with seven subsets of these proteins. Users can evaluate their method on any subset or a complete set of data. The method is assessed at amino acid level and performance is evaluated in terms of Qtotal, Qpredicted, Qobserved and MCC measures. The server also compares the performance of the method with other existing beta-turn prediction methods such as Chou-Fasman algorithm, Thornton's algorithm, GORBTURN, 1-4 and 2-3 Correlation model, Sequence coupled model and BTPRED. The server is accessible from http://imtech.res.in/raghava/bteval/", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Kaur H."}, {"name": "Raghava G.P."}], "date": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://imtech.res.in/raghava/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bteval", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/bteval", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}, {"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The aim of BTEVAL server is to evaluate beta turn prediction algorithms on a uniform data set of 426 proteins or subsets of these proteins.
