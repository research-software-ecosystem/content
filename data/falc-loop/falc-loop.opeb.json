The server may be used to construct loop regions in homology modeling, to refine unreliable loop regions in experimental structures or to model segments of designed sequences. The FALC method is computationally less expensive than typical ab initio methods because the conformational search space is effectively reduced by the use of fragments derived from a structure database. The analytical loop closure algorithm allows efficient search for loop conformations that fit into the protein framework starting from the fragment-assembled structures. The FALC method shows prediction accuracy comparable to other state-of-the-art loop modeling methods. Top-ranked model structures can be visualized on the web server, and an ensemble of loop structures can be downloaded for further analysis.
