description: Delly performs Structural variant discovery by integrated paired-end
  and split-read analysis. It discovers, genotypes and visualizes deletions, tandem
  duplications, inversions and translocations at single-nucleotide resolution in short-read
  massively parallel sequencing data. It uses paired-ends, split-reads and read-depth
  to sensitively and accurately delineate genomic rearrangements throughout the genome.
