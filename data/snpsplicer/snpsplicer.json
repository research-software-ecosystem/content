SNPs that lead to single amino acid substitutions, stop codons, or frameshift mutations can be readily interpreted, but these represent only a fraction of known SNPs. Many SNPs are located in sequences of splicing relevance-the canonical splice site consensus sequences, exonic and intronic splice enhancers or silencers (exonic splice enhancer [ESE], intronic splice enhancer [ISE], exonic splicing silencer [ESS], and intronic splicing silencer [ISS]), and others. We propose using sets of matching DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) as a screening method to investigate the potential splice effects of SNPs in RT-PCR experiments with tissue material from genotyped sources. We have developed a software solution (SNPSplicer; www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/snpsplicer) that aids in the rapid interpretation of such screening experiments. The utility of the approach is illustrated for SNPs affecting the donor splice sites (rs2076530:A > G, rs3816989:G > A) leading to the use of a cryptic splice site and exon skipping, respectively, and an exonic splice enhancer SNP (rs2274987:C/T), leading to inclusion of a new exon. We anticipate that this methodology may help in the functional annotation of SNPs in a more high-throughput fashion. \u00a9 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 26, "authors": [{"name": "ElSharawy A."}, {"name": "Manaster C."}, {"name": "Teuber M."}, {"name": "Rosenstiel P."}, {"name": "Kwiatkowski R."}, {"name": "Huse K."}, {"name": "Platzer M."}, {"name": "Becker A."}, {"name": "Nurnberg P."}, {"name": "Schreiber S."}, {"name": "Hampe J."}], "date": "2006-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Human Mutation"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sekretariat@mucosa.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:snpsplicer", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/resources/download-tools/software/snpsplicer", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Program for the systematic analysis of SNP-dependent splicing in genotyped cDNAs.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/snpsplicer-1-0-0-analyse-snp-dependent-splicing-genotyped-cdnas.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "snpsplicer", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:00:03Z", "name": "SNPSplicer", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/resources/download-tools/software/snpsplicer", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
