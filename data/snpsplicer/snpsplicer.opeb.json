SNPs that lead to single amino acid substitutions, stop codons, or frameshift mutations can be readily interpreted, but these represent only a fraction of known SNPs. Many SNPs are located in sequences of splicing relevance-the canonical splice site consensus sequences, exonic and intronic splice enhancers or silencers (exonic splice enhancer [ESE], intronic splice enhancer [ISE], exonic splicing silencer [ESS], and intronic splicing silencer [ISS]), and others. We propose using sets of matching DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) as a screening method to investigate the potential splice effects of SNPs in RT-PCR experiments with tissue material from genotyped sources. We have developed a software solution (SNPSplicer; www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/snpsplicer) that aids in the rapid interpretation of such screening experiments. The utility of the approach is illustrated for SNPs affecting the donor splice sites (rs2076530:A > G, rs3816989:G > A) leading to the use of a cryptic splice site and exon skipping, respectively, and an exonic splice enhancer SNP (rs2274987:C/T), leading to inclusion of a new exon. We anticipate that this methodology may help in the functional annotation of SNPs in a more high-throughput fashion. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","authors":["ElSharawy A.","Manaster C.","Teuber M.","Rosenstiel P.","Kwiatkowski R.","Huse K.","Platzer M.","Becker A.","Nurnberg P.","Schreiber S.","Hampe J."],"cit_count":26,"journal":"Human Mutation","pmid":"16937379","title":"SNPSplicer: Systematic analysis of SNP-dependent splicing in genotyped cDNAs","year":"2006-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snpsplicer","biotoolsID":"snpsplicer","description":"Program for the systematic analysis of SNP-dependent splicing in genotyped cDNAs.","homepage":"http://www.ikmb.uni-kiel.de/resources/download-tools/software/snpsplicer","name":"SNPSplicer"}}
