                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to diagnose disease is an effective technique in medical research. Several statistical methods have been developed for the classification of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, including, for example, Poisson linear discriminant analysis (PLDA), negative binomial linear discriminant analysis (NBLDA), and zero-inflated Poisson logistic discriminant analysis (ZIPLDA). Nevertheless, few existing methods perform well for large sample scRNA-seq data, in particular when the distribution assumption is also violated. Results: We propose a deep learning classifier (scDLC) for large sample scRNA-seq data, based on the long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs). Our new scDLC does not require a prior knowledge on the data distribution, but instead, it takes into account the dependency of the most outstanding feature genes in the LSTMs model. LSTMs is a special recurrent neural network, which can learn long-term dependencies of a sequence. Conclusions: Simulation studies show that our new scDLC performs consistently better than the existing methods in a wide range of settings with large sample sizes. Four real scRNA-seq datasets are also analyzed, and they coincide with the simulation results that our new scDLC always performs the best. The code named “scDLC” is publicly available at https://github.com/scDLC-code/code.",
