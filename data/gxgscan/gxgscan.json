We introduce a new two-step procedure for testing G \u00d7 G interactions in case-control GWAS to detect interacting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) regardless of their marginal effects. In an initial screening step, all SNP pairs are tested for gene-gene association in the combined sample of cases and controls. In the second step, the pairs that pass the screening are followed up with a traditional test for G \u00d7 G interaction. We show that the two-step method is substantially more powerful to detect G \u00d7 G interactions than the exhaustive testing approach. For example, with 2,000 cases and 2,000 controls, the two-step method can have more than 90% power to detect an interaction odds ratio of 2.0 compared to less than 50% power for the exhaustive testing approach. Moreover, we show that a hybrid two-step approach that combines our newly proposed two-step test and the two-step test that screens for marginal effects retains the best power properties of both. The two-step procedures we introduce have the potential to uncover genetic signals that have not been previously identified in an initial single-SNP GWAS. We demonstrate the computational feasibility of the two-step G \u00d7 G procedure by performing a G \u00d7 G scan in the asthma GWAS of the University of Southern California Children's Health Study. \u00a9 2013 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Lewinger J.P."}, {"name": "Morrison J.L."}, {"name": "Thomas D.C."}, {"name": "Murcray C.E."}, {"name": "Conti D.V."}, {"name": "Li D."}, {"name": "Gauderman W.J."}], "date": "2013-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genetic Epidemiology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Department of Biostatistics USC", "url": "http://keck.usc.edu/preventive-medicine/contact-us/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gxgscan", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://biostats.usc.edu/software", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0361"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Performs the two-step GxG test to detect GxG interactions in a genome-wide association study", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/gxgscan-20130418-detect-gxg-interactions-in-a-genome-wide-association-study.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "gxgscan", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:45:42Z", "name": "GxGscan", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://biostats.usc.edu/DownloadGxGScan.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
