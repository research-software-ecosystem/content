SAAFEC-SEQ uses gradient boosting decision tree repressor to encode physicochemical properties, sequence features and evolutionary information to compute the change in stability free energy resulting from single mutations. SAAFEC-SEQ outperforms all existing state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-squared-error parameters for several independent datasets.",
