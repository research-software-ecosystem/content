The information that guides the protein to mitochondria is contained in its sequence and structure, although no direct evidence can be obtained. In this article, discriminant analysis has been performed with 47 parameters and a large set of mitochondrial proteins extracted from the SwissProt database. A computational method that facilitates the analysis and objective prediction of mitochondrially imported proteins has been developed. If only the amino acid sequence is considered, 75-97% of the mitochondrial proteins studied have been predicted to be imported into mitochondria. Moreover, the existence of mitochondrial-targeting sequences is predicted in 76-94% of the analyzed mitochondrial precursor proteins. As a practical application, the number of unknown yeast open reading frames that might be mitochondrial proteins has been predicted, which revealed that many of them are clustered.", "citationCount": 1189, "authors": [{"name": "Claros M.G."}, {"name": "Vincens P."}], "date": "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "European Journal of Biochemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Manuel G.
