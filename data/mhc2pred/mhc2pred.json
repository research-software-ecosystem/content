In the past, a number of methods have been developed for predicting major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-binding peptides using machine learning techniques. These methods allow predicting MHC-binding peptides with high accuracy. In this chapter, we describe two machine learning technique-based methods, nHLAPred and MHC2Pred, developed for predicting MHC binders for class I and class II alleles, respectively. nHLAPred is a web server developed for predicting binders for 67 MHC class I alleles. This sever has two methods: ANNPred and ComPred. ComPred allows predicting binders for 67 MHC class I alleles, using the combined method [artificial neural network (ANN) and quantitative matrix] for 30 alleles and quantitative matrix-based method for 37 alleles. ANNPred allows prediction of binders for only 30 alleles purely based on the ANN. MHC2Pred is a support vector machine (SVM)-based method for prediction of promiscuous binders for 42 MHC class II alleles.", "citationCount": 29, "authors": [{"name": "Lata S."}, {"name": "Bhasin M."}, {"name": "Raghava G.P."}], "date": "2007-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr. G.P.S.
