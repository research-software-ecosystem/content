The use of modified proteins is increasingly widespread: their presence in food, commercial products, such as washing powder, and medical therapeutics and diagnostics, makes predicting and identifying potential allergens a crucial societal issue. The prediction of allergens has been explored widely using bioinformatics, with many tools being developed in the last decade; many of these are freely available online. Here, we report a set of novel models for allergen prediction utilizing amino acid E-descriptors, auto- and cross-covariance transformation, and several machine learning methods for classification, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), na\u00efve Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and k nearest neighbours (kNN). The best performing method was kNN with 85.3% accuracy at 5-fold cross-validation. The resulting model has been implemented in a revised version of the AllerTOP server (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP). \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2014.", "citationCount": 20, "authors": [{"name": "Dimitrov I."}, {"name": "Bangov I."}, {"name": "Flower D.R."}, {"name": "Doytchinova I."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Modeling"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Drug Design Group", "url": "http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/ddg/index.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:allertop", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-28T10:50:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Server for in silico prediction of allergens based on the main physicochemical properties of proteins.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/allertop-2-allergenicity-prediction.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "allertop", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:12Z", "name": "AllerTOP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP/method.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
