Hence, quality control (QC) by removing individuals or markers with low genotyping quality is of utmost importance to minimize potential false positive associations. IPGWAS was developed to facilitate the identification of the rational thresholds in QC of GWAS datasets, association analysis, Manhattan plot, quantile-quantile (QQ) plot, and format conversion for genetic analyses, such as meta-analysis, genotype phasing, and imputation. IPGWAS is a multiplatform application written in Perl with a graphical user interface (GUI) and available for free at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipgwas/. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Inc.",
