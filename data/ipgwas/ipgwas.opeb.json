Hence, quality control (QC) by removing individuals or markers with low genotyping quality is of utmost importance to minimize potential false positive associations. IPGWAS was developed to facilitate the identification of the rational thresholds in QC of GWAS datasets, association analysis, Manhattan plot, quantile-quantile (QQ) plot, and format conversion for genetic analyses, such as meta-analysis, genotype phasing, and imputation.
