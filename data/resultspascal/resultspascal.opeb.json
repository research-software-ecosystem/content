ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CONCLUSIONS:PASCAL', 'PASCAL', 'Gene-based analysis ADHD using PASCAL'","homepage":"https://www2.unil.ch/cbg/index.php?title=Pascal","name":"RESULTS:PASCAL"}}
