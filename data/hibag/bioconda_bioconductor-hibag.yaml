about:
  description: Imputes HLA classical alleles using GWAS SNP data, and it relies on
    a training set of HLA and SNP genotypes. HIBAG can be used by researchers with
    published parameter estimates instead of requiring access to large training sample
    datasets. It combines the concepts of attribute bagging, an ensemble classifier
    method, with haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging is
    a technique which improves the accuracy and stability of classifier ensembles
    using bootstrap aggregating and random variable selection.
