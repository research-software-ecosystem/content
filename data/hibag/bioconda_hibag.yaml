description: It is a software package for imputing HLA types using SNP data, and relies
  on a training set of HLA and SNP genotypes. HIBAG can be used by researchers with
  published parameter estimates instead of requiring access to large training sample
  datasets. It combines the concepts of attribute bagging, an ensemble classifier
  method, with haplotype inference for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging is a
  technique which improves the accuracy and stability of classifier ensembles using
  bootstrap aggregating and random variable selection.
