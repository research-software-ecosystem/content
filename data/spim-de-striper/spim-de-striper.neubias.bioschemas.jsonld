  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This macro implements a filter that is meant to attenuate close to parallel intensity stripes in an image, such as often happening in light sheet microscopy. The results are usually decent even when the stripes show a large angular spread due to light sheet refraction at the sample surface. The filter can process a 3D stack but the processing is performed slice by slice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Example image is available in the documentation link.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
