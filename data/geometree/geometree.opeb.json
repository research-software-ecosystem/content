This metric, the geodesic distance, is the length of the shortest path through that space. We present an exact algorithm to compute this metric. For biologically reasonable trees, the implementation allows fast computations of the geodesic distance, although the running time of the algorithm is worst-case exponential. The algorithm was applied to pairs of 118 gene trees of the metazoa. The results show that a special path in tree space, the cone path, which can be computed in linear time, is a good approximation of the geodesic distance. The program GeoMeTree is a python implementation of the geodesic distance, and it is approximations and is available from www.cibiv.at/software/geometree. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.",
