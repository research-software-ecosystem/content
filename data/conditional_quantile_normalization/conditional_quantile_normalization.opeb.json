Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GC-content) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions. © 2012 The Author.","authors":["Hansen K.D.","Irizarry R.A.","Wu Z."],"cit_count":194,"doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr054","journal":"Biostatistics","title":"Removing technical variability in RNA-seq data using conditional quantile normalization","type":"Primary","year":"2012-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:conditional_quantile_normalization","biotoolsID":"conditional_quantile_normalization","description":"A normalization tool for RNA-Seq data, implementing the conditional quantile normalization method.","homepage":"http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cqn.html","name":"Conditional quantile normalization","version":["1.14.0"]}}
