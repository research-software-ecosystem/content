  "sc:description": "The Subread read aligner and Subjunc junction detector employ a novel read mapping paradigm called \"seed-and-vote\" to achieve a fast mapping speed and a high mapping accuracy. The seed-and-vote paradigm is particularly powerful in detecting indels. Subjunc can be used to discover exon-exon junctions from RNA-seq data.",
