description: Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis (DTA) can monitor the cellular response
  to perturbations with higher sensitivity and temporal resolution than standard transcriptomics.
  The package implements the underlying kinetic modeling approach capable of the precise
  determination of synthesis- and decay rates from individual microarray or RNAseq
  measurements.
