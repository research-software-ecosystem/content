    "description": "A phylogenetic simulator of trees, genomes and sequences that accounts for dead linages | Evolution simulator with extinct lineages | Zombi: A phylogenetic simulator of trees, genomes and sequences that accounts for dead lineages | Zombi is a flexible platform of genome evolution which can be of great interest to those who want to test different evolutionary hypotheses under simulations and need to use a fast and easy-to-use tool to generate species trees, gene trees or sequences. Zombi's output is especially simple and easy to read, understand and parse",

All rights reserved.Here we present Zombi, a tool to simulate the evolution of species, genomes and sequences in silico, that considers for the first time the evolution of genomes in extinct lineages. It also incorporates various features that have not to date been combined in a single simulator, such as the possibility of generating species trees with a pre-defined variation of speciation and extinction rates through time, simulating explicitly intergenic sequences of variable length and outputting gene tree-species tree reconciliations.",
