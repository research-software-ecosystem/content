It may be run with phases from experimental phasing, or it can calculate its own phases using a side-chain-omit process. In this case it can be used after molecular replacement, or to validate structures in the PDB.","homepage":"http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/~cowtan/sequins/sequins.html","name":"sequins","version":["20070909"]}}
