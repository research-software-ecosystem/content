Enables performance evaluation of various normalization methods from multiple perspectives. In particular, it integrates 5 well-established criteria, each with a distinct underlying theory, to ensure a more comprehensive evaluation than any single criterion. Moreover, it provides various available and popular normalization methods, with a unique feature of allowing quality control based correction sequentially followed by data normalization.","homepage":"http://server.idrb.cqu.edu.cn/noreva/","name":"NOREVA"}}
