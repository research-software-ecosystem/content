The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of 3D VizStruct, a novel multi-dimensional data visualization technique for analyzing patterns in SNP datasets. Results: VizStruct is an interactive visualization technique that reduces multi-dimensional data to two dimensions using the complex-valued harmonics of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). In the 3D VizStruct extension, the multi-dimensional SNP data vectors are reduced to three dimensions using a combination of the DFT and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The performance of 3D VizStruct was challenged with several biologically relevant published datasets that included human Chromosome 21, the human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene locus and the multi-locus genotypes of coral populations. In every case, the 3D VizStruct mapping provided an intuitive visual description of the key characteristics of the underlying multi-dimensional genotype. © 2006 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Bhasi K.","Zhang L.","Brazeau D.","Zhang A.","Ramanathan M."],"cit_count":9,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btl144","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"16613906","title":"VizStruct for visualization of genome-wide SNP analyses","type":"Primary","year":"2006-07-01"},{"pmcid":"PMC2607484","pmid":"14693813","type":"Primary"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vizstruct","biotoolsID":"vizstruct","description":"Exploratory visualisation for gene expression profiling.","homepage":"https://www.cse.buffalo.edu/DBGROUP/bioinformatics/supplementary/vizstruct/index.html","name":"VizStruct"}}
