                "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in many biological processes and are implicated in several diseases. With the next-generation sequencing technologies, substantial unannotated transcripts have been discovered. Classifying unannotated transcripts using biological experiments are more time-consuming and expensive than computational approaches. Several tools are available for identifying long non-coding RNAs. These tools, however, did not explain the features in their tools that contributed to the prediction results. Here, we present Xlnc1DCNN, a tool for distinguishing long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from protein-coding transcripts (PCTs) using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network with prediction explanations. The evaluation results of the human test set showed that Xlnc1DCNN outperformed other state-of-the-art tools in terms of accuracy and F1-score. The explanation results revealed that lncRNA transcripts were mainly identified as sequences with no conserved regions, short patterns with unknown functions, or only regions of transmembrane helices while protein-coding transcripts were mostly classified by conserved protein domains or families. The explanation results also conveyed the probably inconsistent annotations among the public databases, lncRNA transcripts which contain protein domains, protein families, or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs).
