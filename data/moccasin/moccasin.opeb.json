Published by Oxford University Press. MATLAB is popular in biological research for creating and simulating models that use ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, sharing or using these models outside of MATLAB is often problematic. A community standard such as Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) can serve as a neutral exchange format, but translating models from MATLAB to SBML can be challenging - especially for legacy models not written with translation in mind. We developed MOCCASIN (Model ODE Converter for Creating Automated SBML INteroperability) to help. MOCCASIN can convert ODE-based MATLAB models of biochemical reaction networks into the SBML format.","authors":["Gomez H.F.","Hucka M.","Keating S.M.","Nudelman G.","Iber D.","Sealfon S.C."],"cit_count":1,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26861819","title":"MOCCASIN: Converting MATLAB ODE models to SBML","year":"2016-06-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:moccasin","biotoolsID":"moccasin","description":"Designed to convert certain basic forms of ODE simulation models written in MATLAB or Octave and translate them into SBML format.","homepage":"https://github.com/sbmlteam/moccasin","name":"MOCCASIN"}}
