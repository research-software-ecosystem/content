This is a matrix-based method that allows the prediction of MHC binding sites in an antigenic sequence for 47 MHC class-I alleles. The server represents MHC binding regions within an antigenic sequence in user-friendly formats. These formats assist user in the identification of promiscuous MHC binders in an antigen sequence that can bind to large number of alleles. ProPred1 also allows the prediction of the standard proteasome and immunoproteasome cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence. This server allows identification of MHC binders, who have the cleavage site at the C terminus. The simultaneous prediction of MHC binders and proteasome cleavage sites in an antigenic sequence leads to the identification of potential T-cell epitopes. © Oxford University Press 2002.","authors":["Singh H.","Raghava G.P.S."],"cit_count":223,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"12761064","title":"ProPred1: Prediction of promiscuous MHC class-I binding sites","year":"2003-05-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:propred1","biotoolsID":"propred1","description":"Online service for identifying the MHC Class-I binding regions in antigens.
