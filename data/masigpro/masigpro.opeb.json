Motivation: The widespread adoption of RNA-seq to quantitatively measure gene expression has increased the scope of sequencing experimental designs to include time-course experiments. maSigPro is an R package specifically suited for the analysis of time-course gene expression data, which was developed originally for microarrays and hence was limited in its application to count data. Results: We have updated maSigPro to support RNA-seq time series analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities of the package. We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset. Availability and implementation: The package is freely available under the LGPL license from the Bioconductor Web site (http://bioconductor.org).","authors":["Nueda M.J.","Tarazona S.","Conesa A."],"cit_count":49,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu333","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Next maSigPro: Updating maSigPro bioconductor package for RNA-seq time series","type":"Primary","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:masigpro","biotoolsID":"masigpro","description":"Regression based approach to find genes for which there are significant gene expression profile differences between experimental groups in time course microarray and RNA-Seq experiments.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maSigPro.html","name":"maSigPro","version":["1.46.0"]}}
