      "sc:description": "Here, we present GENome Organisation Visual Analytics (GENOVA): a software suite to perform in-depth analyses on various levels of genome organisation, using Hi-C data. GENOVA facilitates the comparison between multiple datasets and supports the majority of mapping-pipelines.\n\nThe increase in interest for Hi-C methods in the chromatin community has led to a need for more user-friendly and powerful analysis methods. The few currently available software packages for Hi-C do not allow a researcher to quickly summarize and visualize their data. An easy to use software package, which can generate a comprehensive set of publication-quality plots, would allow researchers to swiftly go from raw Hi-C data to interpretable results.",
