description: This package implements several functions useful for analysis of gene
  expression data by sequencing tags as done in SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expressen)
  data, i.e. extraction of a SAGE library from sequence files, sequence error correction,
  library comparison. Sequencing error correction is implementing using an Expectation
  Maximization Algorithm based on a Mixture Model of tag counts.
