description: Provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4 classes for storing,
  manipulating and aggregating over annotated ranges of integers. Implements an algebra
  of range operations, including efficient algorithms for finding overlaps and nearest
  neighbors. Defines efficient list-like classes for storing, transforming and aggregating
  large grouped data, i.e., collections of atomic vectors and DataFrames.
