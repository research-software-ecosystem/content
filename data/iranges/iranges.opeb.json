Implements an algebra of range operations, including efficient algorithms for finding overlaps and nearest neighbors. Defines efficient list-like classes for storing, transforming and aggregating large grouped data, i.e., collections of atomic vectors and DataFrames.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IRanges.html","name":"IRanges","version":["2.8.1"]}}
