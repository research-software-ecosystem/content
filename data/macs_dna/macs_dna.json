    "description": "It is a simulator of the coalescent process that simulates geneologies spatially across chromosomes as a Markovian process. The algorithm scales linearly in time with respect to sample size and sequence length. However, it more accurately models the true coalescent, while supporting all demographic scenarios found in the popular program MS making this program appropriate for simulating data for structured populations in genome wide association studies.",

                "abstract": "Simulation of genomic sequences under the coalescent with recombination has conventionally been impractical for regions beyond tens of megabases. This work presents an algorithm, implemented as the program MaCS (Markovian Coalescent Simulator), that can efficiently simulate haplotypes under any arbitrary model of population history. We present several metrics comparing the performance of MaCS with other available simulation programs. Practical usage of MaCS is demonstrated through a comparison of measures of linkage disequilibrium between generated program output and real genotype data from populations considered to be structured. \u00a9 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",
