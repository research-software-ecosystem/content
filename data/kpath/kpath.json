Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Storing, transmitting and archiving data produced by next-generation sequencing is a significant computational burden. New compression techniques tailored to short-read sequence data are needed. Results: We present here an approach to compression that reduces the difficulty of managing large-scale sequencing data. Our novel approach sits between pure reference-based compression and reference-free compression and combines much of the benefit of reference-based approaches with the flexibility of de novo encoding. Our method, called path encoding, draws a connection between storing paths in de Bruijn graphs and context-dependent arithmetic coding. Supporting this method is a system to compactly store sets of kmers that is of independent interest. We are able to encode RNA-seq reads using 3-11% of the space of the sequence in raw FASTA files, which is on average more than 34% smaller than competing approaches. We also show that even if the reference is very poorly matched to the reads that are being encoded, good compression can still be achieved.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Kingsford C."}, {"name": "Patro R."}], "date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://kingsfordlab.cbd.cmu.edu/group/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:kpath", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/software/pathenc/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Formatting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Reference-based compression software of short read data sets.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/kpath-0-6-3-statistical-reference-based-compression-for-short-reads.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "kpath", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:47:48Z", "name": "Kpath", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/software/pathenc/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
