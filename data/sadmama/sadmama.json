Results: We present SADMAMA, a computational solution to a address this problem. SADMAMA implements two types of statistical tests to answer this question: one type is based on simplified models, while the other relies on bootstrapping, and as such might be preferable to users who are averse to such models. The bootstrap approach incorporates a novel \"site-protected\" resampling procedure which solves a problem we identify with naive resampling. Conclusion: SADMAMA's utility is demonstrated here by offering a plausible explanation to the differential ARS activity observed in our previous mcm1-1 mutant experiments, by suggesting the relevance of multiple weak ACS matches to efficient replication origin function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and by suggesting an explanation to the observed negative effect FKH2 has on chromatin silencing. \u00a9 2008 Keich et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Keich U."}, {"name": "Gao H."}, {"name": "Garretson J.S."}, {"name": "Bhaskar A."}, {"name": "Liachko I."}, {"name": "Donato J."}, {"name": "Tye B.K."}], "date": "2008-09-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "keich@cs.cornell.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sadmama", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["20110410"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/uri/SADMAMA/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Motif scanning", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0239"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Computational detection of significant variation in binding affinity across two sets of sequences.
