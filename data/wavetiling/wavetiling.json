Increasingly often, however, biologists are interested in time-course studies, studies with more than two conditions or even multiple-factor studies. As these studies are currently analyzed with the traditional microarray analysis techniques, they do not exploit the genome-wide nature of tiling array data to its full potential.Results: We present an R Bioconductor package, waveTiling, which implements a wavelet-based model for analyzing transcriptome data and extends it towards more complex experimental designs. With waveTiling the user is able to discover (1) group-wise expressed regions, (2) differentially expressed regions between any two groups in single-factor studies and in (3) multifactorial designs. Moreover, for time-course experiments it is also possible to detect (4) linear time effects and (5) a circadian rhythm of transcripts. By considering the expression values of the individual tiling probes as a function of genomic position, effect regions can be detected regardless of existing annotation. Three case studies with different experimental set-ups illustrate the use and the flexibility of the model-based transcriptome analysis.Conclusions: The waveTiling package provides the user with a convenient tool for the analysis of tiling array trancriptome data for a multitude of experimental set-ups. Regardless of the study design, the probe-wise analysis allows for the detection of transcriptional effects in both exonic, intronic and intergenic regions, without prior consultation of existing annotation. \u00a9 2012 De Beuf et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Beuf K.D."}, {"name": "Pipelers P."}, {"name": "Andriankaja M."}, {"name": "Thas O."}, {"name": "Inze D."}, {"name": "Crainiceanu C."}, {"name": "Clement L."}], "date": "2012-09-14T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Kristof De Beuf", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kristof.debeuf@UGent.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:wavetiling", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.20.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/waveTiling.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}, {"term": "Transcriptome assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3258"}, {"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package is designed to conduct transcriptome analysis for tiling arrays based on fast wavelet-based functional models.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["ELIXIR-EE"]}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/wavetiling/", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "wavetiling", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:02:46Z", "name": "waveTiling", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/waveTiling.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
