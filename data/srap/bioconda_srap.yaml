description: This package provides a pipeline for gene expression analysis (primarily
  for RNA-Seq data).  The normalization function is specific for RNA-Seq analysis,
  but all other functions (Quality Control Figures, Differential Expression and Visualization,
  and Functional Enrichment via BD-Func) will work with any type of gene expression
  data.
