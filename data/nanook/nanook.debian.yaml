  description: pre- and post-alignment analysis of nanopore sequencing data
  long_description: " NanoOK is a flexible, multi-reference software for pre- and\
    \ post-\n alignment analysis of nanopore sequencing data, quality and error\n\
    \ profiles.\n .\n NanoOK (pronounced na-nook) is a tool for extraction, alignment\
    \ and\n analysis of Nanopore reads. NanoOK will extract reads as FASTA or FASTQ\n\
    \ files, align them (with a choice of alignment tools), then generate a\n comprehensive\
    \ multi-page PDF report containing yield, accuracy and\n quality analysis. Along\
    \ the way, it generates plain text files which can\n be used for further analysis,\
    \ as well as graphs suitable for inclusion\n in presentations and papers.\n"
