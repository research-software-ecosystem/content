    "description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'dynnomapp', 'predictive nomogram', 'SEER' | Dynamic prediction of long-term survival in patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma | BACKGROUND:This study investigated a large number of patients to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator that can dynamically predict the long-term survival of patients with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. METHODS:A total of 2647 patients diagnosed with primary gastric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from 1998 to 2014 were extracted from the SEER database. We used the Lasso Cox regression model to identify independent risk factors for long-term survival and to develop a predictive nomogram for survival and a web-based survival rate calculator. RESULTS:The median (mean) follow-up time was 30 months (52.8 months). Cancer-specific survival rates decreased with time, while the 5-year conditional survival increased with time",
