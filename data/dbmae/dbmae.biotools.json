                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.Recently, data on 'random' autosomal monoallelic expression has become available for the entire genome in multiple human and mouse tissues and cell types, creating a need for better access and dissemination. The database of autosomal monoallelic expression (dbMAE; https://mae.hms.harvard.edu) incorporates data from multiple recent reports of genome-wide analyses. These include transcriptome-wide analyses of allelic imbalance in clonal cell populations based on sequence polymorphisms, as well as indirect identification, based on a specific chromatin signature present in MAE gene bodies. Currently, dbMAE contains transcriptomewide chromatin identification calls for 8 human and 21 mouse tissues, and describes over 16 000 murine and \u223c700 human cases of directly measured biased expression, compiled from allele-specific RNA-seq and genotyping array data. All data are manually curated. To ensure cross-publication uniformity, we performed re-analysis of transcriptome-wide RNA-seq data using the same pipeline. Data are accessed through an interface that allows for basic and advanced searches; all source references, including raw data, are clearly described and hyperlinked. This ensures the utility of the resource as an initial screening tool for those interested in investigating the role of monoallelic expression in their specific genes and tissues of interest.",
