  "sc:description": "Breakpointer is a fast tool for locating sequence breakpoints from the alignment of single end reads (SE) produced by next generation sequencing (NGS). It adopts a heuristic method in searching for local mapping signatures created by insertion/deletions (indels) or more complex structural variants(SVs). With current NGS single-end sequencing data, the output regions by Breakpoint mainly contain the approximate breakpoints of indels and a limited number of large SVs.",
