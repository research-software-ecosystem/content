Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The integration of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and phenotypic traits across genetically diverse populations is a powerful approach to discover novel biological regulators. The increasing volume of complex data require new and easy-to-use tools accessible to a variety of scientists for the discovery and visualization of functionally relevant associations. To meet this requirement, we developed CoffeeProt, an open-source tool that analyses genetic variants associated to protein networks, other omics datatypes and phenotypic traits. CoffeeProt uses transcriptomics or proteomics data to perform correlation network analyses and annotates results with protein-protein interactions, subcellular localisations and drug associations. It then integrates genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs) or protein abundance (pQTLs) and includes predictions of the potential consequences of variants on gene function. Finally, genetic variants are co-mapped to molecular or phenotypic traits either provided by the user or retrieved directly from publicly available GWAS results. We demonstrate its utility with the analysis of mouse and human population data enabling the rapid identification of genetic variants associated with druggable proteins and clinical traits. We expect that CoffeeProt will serve the systems genetics and basic science research communities, leading to the discovery of novel biologically relevant associations. CoffeeProt is available at www.coffeeprot.com.",
