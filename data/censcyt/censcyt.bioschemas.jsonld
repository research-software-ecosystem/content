      "sc:description": "censcyt is an R package extending the diffcyt (differential discovery in high-dimensional cytometry via high-resolution clustering) pipeline. censcyt (Censored diffcyt) includes methods for differential abundance analysis in the presence of a covariate subject to right censoring. It uses the reversed association testing approach (like diffcyt) meaning the censored variable (e.g. survival time) is modeled as a predictor. Classical survival analysis methods on the other hand model the censored variable as the response.",
