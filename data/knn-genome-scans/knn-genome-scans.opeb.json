Here, we introduce a series of versatile genome-scan methods that are based on non-parametric k -nearest neighbors (kNN) techniques, while incorporating pairwise Fixation Index ( F ST ) estimates and pairwise nucleotide differences ( d xy ) as features. Simulations were performed for both positive directional selection and introgression, with varying parameters, such as recombination rates, population background histories, the proportion of introgression, and the time of gene flow. We find that kNN-based methods perform remarkably well while yielding stable results almost over the entire range of k",
