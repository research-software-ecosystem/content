However, they are technically challenging. GLOGS (Genome-wide LOGistic mixed model/Score test) addresses such challenges with efficient statistical procedures and a parallel implementation. GLOGS has high power relative to alternative approaches as risk covariate effects increase, and can complete a GWAS in minutes. \u00a9 The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.
