    "description": "The dose-response relationships that you can find in this downloadable file can be found in the systematic review of Rocabois et al.(2024) , which focused on chemical exposures occurring during pregnancy and childhood, and different health outcomes– metabolic, neurodevelopmental, respiratory – occurring before a child‘s 18th birthday. This study is one of the largest systematic reviews on dose-response relationships of chemical exposures focusing on children, in terms of number of exposome components considered and could help perform health impact assessments.",
