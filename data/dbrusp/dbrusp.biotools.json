                "abstract": "The Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) contains more than forty metabolic disorders recommended for inclusion in universal newborn screening (NBS). Tandem-mass-spectrometry-based screening of metabolic analytes in dried blood spot samples identifies most affected newborns, along with a number of false positive results. Due to their influence on blood metabolite levels, continuous and categorical covariates such as gestational age, birth weight, age at blood collection, sex, parent-reported ethnicity, and parenteral nutrition status have been shown to reduce the accuracy of screening. Here, we developed a database and web-based tools (dbRUSP) for the analysis of 41 NBS metabolites and six variables for a cohort of 500,539 screen-negative newborns reported by the California NBS program. The interactive database, built using the R shiny package, contains separate modules to study the influence of single variables and joint effects of multiple variables on metabolite levels. Users can input an individual’s variables to obtain metabolite level reference ranges and utilize dbRUSP to select new candidate markers for the detection of metabolic conditions. The open-source format facilitates the development of data mining algorithms that incorporate the influence of covariates on metabolism to increase accuracy in genetic disease screening.",
