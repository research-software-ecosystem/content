      "sc:description": "Welcome to PyPLIF-HIPPOS's project page. PyPLIF-HIPPOS is an upgraded version of PyPLIF (Python-based Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting), a tool for molecular docking post-analysis. It will translate the 3D coordinates of both ligand(s) (generated from docking simulation) and protein into a series of interaction bitstring (also known as Interaction Fingerprint) (see image below). HIPPOS (/ˌhipoʊz/) is a recursive acronym of HIPPOS Is PyPLIF On Steroids. From this point forward, PyPLIF-HIPPOS is simplified to HIPPOS.\n\nmodule to read and process the molecule files from the molecular.\n\nThe current version only support the Sybil mol2 format, but it is planned.",
