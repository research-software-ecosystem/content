    "description": "Welcome to PyPLIF-HIPPOS's project page. PyPLIF-HIPPOS is an upgraded version of PyPLIF (Python-based Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprinting), a tool for molecular docking post-analysis. It will translate the 3D coordinates of both ligand(s) (generated from docking simulation) and protein into a series of interaction bitstring (also known as Interaction Fingerprint) (see image below). HIPPOS (/ˌhipoʊz/) is a recursive acronym of HIPPOS Is PyPLIF On Steroids. From this point forward, PyPLIF-HIPPOS is simplified to HIPPOS.\n\nmodule to read and process the molecule files from the molecular.\n\nThe current version only support the Sybil mol2 format, but it is planned.",

Its predecessor, PyPLIF (https://github.com/radifar/pyplif), is a molecular interaction fingerprinting tool for the docking results of PLANTS, exclusively. Unlike its predecessor, PyPLIF HIPPOS speeds up the computational times by separating the reference generation and docking analysis. PyPLIF HIPPOS also offers more options compared to PyPLIF. PyPLIF HIPPOS for Linux is stored as the Supporting Information in this application note and can be accessed in GitHub (https://github.com/radifar/PyPLIF-HIPPOS). Additionally, we present here the application of the tool in a retrospective structure-based virtual screening campaign targeting neuraminidase.",
