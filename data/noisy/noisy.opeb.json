Large evolutionary distances imply a large number of homoplastic sites. As most protein-coding genes show dramatic variations in substitution rates that are not uncorrelated across the sequence, this often leads to a patchwork pattern of (i) phylogenetically informative and (ii) effectively randomized regions. In highly variable regions, furthermore, alignment errors accumulate resulting in sometimes misleading signals in phylogenetic reconstruction. Results: We present here a method that, based on assessing the distribution of character states along a cyclic ordering of the taxa, allows the identification of phylogenetically uninformative homoplastic sites in a multiple sequence alignment. Removal of these sites appears to improve the performance of phylogenetic reconstruction algorithms as measured by various indices of \"tree quality\". In particular, we obtain more stable trees due to the exclusion of phylogenetically incompatible sites that most likely represent strongly randomized characters. Software: The computer program noisy implements this approach. It can be employed to improving phylogenetic reconstruction capability with quite a considerable success rate whenever (1) the average bootstrap support obtained from the original alignment is low, and (2) there are sufficiently many taxa in the data set - at least, say, 12 to 15 taxa.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","authors":["Afgan E.","Baker D.","van den Beek M.","Blankenberg D.","Bouvier D.","Cech M.","Chilton J.","Clements D.","Coraor N.","Eberhard C.","Gruning B.","Guerler A.","Hillman-Jackson J.","Von Kuster G.","Rasche E.","Soranzo N.","Turaga N.","Taylor J.","Nekrutenko A.","Goecks J."],"cit_count":523,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkw343","journal":"Nucleic acids research","title":"The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update","type":"Other","year":"2016-07-08"},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","type":"Other"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:noisy-ip","biotoolsID":"noisy","description":"Cleaning aligned sequences.","homepage":"http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/noisy/","name":"noisy","version":["1.5.12.1"]}}
