      "sc:description": "Identification of ligand-binding residues using protein sequence profile alignment and query-specific support vector machine model.\n\nInformation embedded in ligand-binding residues (LBRs) of proteins is important for understanding protein functions. How to accurately identify the potential ligand-binding residues is still a challenging problem, especially only protein sequence is given. In this paper, we establish a new query-specific computational method, named I-LBR, for the identification of LBRs without directly using the information of protein 3D structure. I-LBR includes two modes, named as I-LBRGP and I-LBRLS, for the general-purpose and ligand-specific LBR identification",
