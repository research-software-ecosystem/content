Match\u2122 is closely interconnected and distributed together with the TRANSFAC\u00ae database. In particular, Match\u2122 uses the matrix library collected in TRANSFAC\u00ae and therefore provides the possibility to search for a great variety of different transcription factor binding sites. Several sets of optimised matrix cut-off values are built in the system to provide a variety of search modes of different stringency. The user may construct and save his/her specific user profiles which are selected subsets of matrices including default or user-defined cut-off values. Furthermore a number of tissue-specific profiles are provided that were compiled by the TRANSFAC\u00ae team. A public version of the Match\u2122 tool is available at: http://www.gene-regulation.com/pub/programs. html#match. The same program with a different web interface can be found at http://compel.bionet.nsc.ru/Match/Match.html. An advanced version of the tool called Match\u2122 Professional is available at http://www.biobase.de.",
