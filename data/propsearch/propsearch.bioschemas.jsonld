  "sc:description": "PROPSEARCH was designed to detect functional and / or structural homologs, if the sequence identity is below about 25%. It uses the amino acid physico-chemical properties, content of bulky residues, content of small residues, average hydrophobicity, average charge a.s.o. and are used as query vector. Sequences in the database are transformed into vectors as well, and the euclidian distance between the query and database sequences is calculated.",
