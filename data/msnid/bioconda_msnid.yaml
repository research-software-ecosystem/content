biotools_id: msnid
description: Extracts MS/MS ID data from mzIdentML (leveraging mzID package) or text
  files. After collating the search results from multiple datasets it assesses their
  identification quality and optimize filtering criteria to achieve the maximum number
  of identifications while not exceeding a specified false discovery rate. Also contains
  a number of utilities to explore the MS/MS results and assess missed and irregular
  enzymatic cleavages, mass measurement accuracy, etc.
