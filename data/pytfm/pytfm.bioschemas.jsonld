      "sc:description": "A tool for Traction Force and Monolayer Stress Microscopy.\n\npyTFM is a python package that allows you to analyze force generation and stresses in cells, cell colonies and confluent cell layers growing on a 2 dimensional surface. This package implements the procedures of Traction Force Microscopy and Monolayer Stress Microscopy. In addition to the standard measures for stress and force generation, it also includes the line tension, a measure for the force transfer exclusively across cell-cell boundaries. pyTFM includes an addon for the image annotation tool clickpoints allowing you to quickly analyze and vizualize large datasets.",
