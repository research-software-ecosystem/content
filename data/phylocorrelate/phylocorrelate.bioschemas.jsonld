Gene co-occurrence is important to detect as it may suggest an interaction between the genes, membership in the same pathway or complex, or more general functional associations or dependencies.\n\nPhylocorrelate is a tool that detects pairs of gene/protein families with similar phylogenetic distributions across the bacterial tree of life. The database contains pre-computed phylogenomic correlations for 27,372 gene families across 28,315 species. PhyloCorrelate uses the GTDB bacterial tree and gene occurrences from AnnoTree including entries from KEGG, PFAM, and TIGRFAM.",
