Motivation: Detection of allelic imbalances in ChIP-Seq reads is a powerful approach to identify functional non-coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs), either polymorphisms or mutations, which modulate the affinity of transcription factors for chromatin. We present ABC, a computational tool that identifies allele-specific binding of transcription factors from aligned ChIP-Seq reads at heterozygous SNVs. ABC controls for potential false positives resulting from biases introduced by the use of short sequencing reads in ChIP-Seq and can efficiently process a large number of heterozygous SNVs. Results: ABC successfully identifies previously characterized functional SNVs, such as the rs4784227 breast cancer risk associated SNP that modulates the affinity of FOXA1 for the chromatin.","authors":["Bailey S.D.","Virtanen C.","Haibe-Kains B.","Lupien M."],"cit_count":7,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25995231","title":"ABC: A tool to identify SNVs causing allele-specific transcription factor binding from ChIP-Seq experiments","year":"2015-07-31"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:abc","biotoolsID":"abc","description":"Computational tool that identifies allele specific binding of transcription factors from aligned ChIP-Seq reads at heterozygous SNVs.","homepage":"https://github.com/mlupien/ABC/","name":"ABC"}}
