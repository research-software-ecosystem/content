CCT currently supports BLAST, hmmpfam and other programs useful for gene and ortholog identification. The software is web based, has a BioPerl core and can be used remotely via a browser or locally on Mac OS X or Linux machines. CCT is particularly useful to scientists who study large sets of molecules in today's evolving information landscape because it color-codes all result files by age and highlights even tiny changes in sequence or annotation. By empowering non-bioinformaticians to automate custom searches and examine current results in context at a glance, CCT allows a remote database submission in the evening to influence the next morning's bench experiment. A demonstration of CCT is available at http://orb.public.stolaf.edu/CCTdemo and the open source software is freely available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/orb-cct. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Landsteiner B.R."}, {"name": "Olson M.R."}, {"name": "Rutherford R."}], "date": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Benjamin Landsteiner", "url": "https://sourceforge.net/u/landstei/profile/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cct", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/orb-cct", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "CCT (Current Comparative Table) is a software package that you can install and set-up on your own system to help you to maintain and search databases.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "cct", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T14:14:49Z", "name": "CCT", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
