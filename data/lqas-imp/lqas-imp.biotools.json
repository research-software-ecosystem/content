    "description": "Adapting Lot Quality Assurance Sampling to accommodate imperfect tests.\n\nThis repository provides code that accompanies the Adapting Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) to accommodate imperfect tests: application to COVID-19 serosurveillance in Haiti paper.\n\nThe goal is to classify an area as \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow\u201d on some trait of interest. In our paper, we were interested in classifying hospitals as having high or low COVID-19 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers in Haiti. In the traditional form of LQAS, the sample size, n, and decision rule, d, are determined by the population size, N, and four parameters defined by users based on the specific context and goals.",
