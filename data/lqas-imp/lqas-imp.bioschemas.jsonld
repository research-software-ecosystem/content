In our paper, we were interested in classifying hospitals as having high or low COVID-19 antibody prevalence among healthcare workers in Haiti. In the traditional form of LQAS, the sample size, n, and decision rule, d, are determined by the population size, N, and four parameters defined by users based on the specific context and goals.",
