      "sc:description": "A semantic biomedical question answering system for retrieving exact and ideal answers to natural language questions.\n\nSemBioNLQA - Semantic Biomedical Natural Language Question Answering - has the ability to handle the kinds of yes/no questions, factoid questions, list questions and summary questions that are commonly asked in the biomedical domain. It consists of question classification, document retrieval, passage retrieval and answer extraction modules. It is aimed to be able to accept a variety of natural language questions and to generate appropriate natural language answers by providing both exact and ideal answers (paragraph-sized summaries). It provides exact answers “yes” or “no” for yes/no questions, biomedical named entities for factoid questions, and a list of biomedical named entities for list questions. In addition to exact answers for yes/no, factoid and list questions, SemBioNLQA also returns ideal answers, while it retrieves only ideal answers for summary questions.",
