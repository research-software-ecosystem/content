Objective: This study aims to identify corresponding differentially expressed genes in cervical cancer by comparing gene expression profiles between normal and cervical cancer samples. Method: To identify differentially expressed genes in cervical cancer, two groups of Affymetrix microarray data available online were analyzed. One group consisted of 43 carcinomatous cervical epithelial cell samples, and the other was composed of 17 healthy cervical epithelial cell samples, both from the Amerindian. R packages\u2014GO.db, KEGG.db and KEGGREST were used to detect GO categories and KEGG pathways with significant overrepresentation in differentially expressed genes comparing with the whole genome. Cytoscape was utilized to construct biological networks. Results: By comparing gene expression profile of normal and cervical cancer samples, 122 differentially expressed genes were identified including 46 up-regulated genes and 76 down-regulated genes. Using the identified differentially expressed genes, a large and a small biological network was constructed. In addition, 402 GO biological processes and 9 KEGG pathways were over-represented. Top significant biological processes included cell cycle and cell proliferation. Moreover, top significant KEGG pathways were oocyte meiosis, cell cycle and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. Most importantly, CDK1 frequently appeared in these processes and pathways, which indicated its significant role in the progression of cervical cancer. Conclusion: CDK1 plays a comprehensive role in mediating genetic networks implicated in the progression of cervical cancer. Novel therapeutics targeting CDK1 or its related pathways might help improve prognosis of advanced stage cervical cancer.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Luo Y."}, {"name": "Wu Y."}, {"name": "Peng Y."}, {"name": "Liu X."}, {"name": "Bie J."}, {"name": "Li S."}], "date": "2016-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Irish Journal of Medical Science"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "BioConductor Package Maintainer", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "maintainer@bioconductor.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:keggrest", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.14.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGREST.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Keyword", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0968"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Identifier", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0842"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "ID mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3282"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Database search results", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2080"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}, {"term": "Image format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3547"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Image", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2968"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}, {"term": "Image format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3547"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A package that provides a client interface to the KEGG REST server.
