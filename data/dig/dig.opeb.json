            "abstract": "A commercially available 9.4 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer was applied in the analysis of tryptic digests of protein mixtures without any separation. First, the method was demonstrated on a mixture of tryptic digests of equine cytochrome c, equine myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. The same method was then applied to human plasma from a healthy blood donor. Computer programs were employed to simplify analysis of the complex spectra. The 2745 peaks in the human plasma electrospray ionization FTICR spectrum could be reduced to 1165 isotopic clusters and 669 unique masses. Out of these, 82 masses matched tryptic fragments of serum albumin with mass measurement errors less than 10 ppm, covering 93% of the sequence. Another 16 masses were assigned to tryptic fragments of transferrin, covering 41% of the sequence on the 10 ppm mass measurement error level (14 within 2 ppm). The mass measurement errors were approximately normal distributed with a standard deviation of 1.7 ppm. This demonstrates the feasibility of combining the ultra-high mass resolving power and accuracy of FTICR mass spectrometry with automated computer analysis for investigating complex biological matrices.
