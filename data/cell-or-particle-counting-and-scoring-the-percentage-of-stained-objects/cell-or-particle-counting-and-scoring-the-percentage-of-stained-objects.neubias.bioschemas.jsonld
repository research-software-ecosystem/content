  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This one example workflow from the Cell Profiler(CP)&nbsp; <a href=\"http://cellprofiler.org/examples/#PercentPositive\">Examples</a> . CP is commonly used to count cells or other objects as well as percent-positives, by measuring the per-cell staining intensity. This pipeline shows how to do both of these tasks, and demonstrates how various modules may be used to accomplish the same result.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a few words, it used the IdentifyPrimaryObject module of CellProfiler to detect nuclei from a channel (e.g DAPI), then again the same module on another channel to detect another probe (e.g some particular histone)&nbsp; .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then objects (nuclei) are related to the second object (Histone), to create a parent child-relation ship: where nuclei can have histone has child. Nuclei are then filtered according to the property of having histone (positive) or not having histone (negtiveobject) related to them.&nbsp; If needed, nuclei can be expanded in order to include touching object rather than object inside only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage of positive nuclei vs total number of nuclei can then be computed using the CalculateMath Module.</p>\r\n",
