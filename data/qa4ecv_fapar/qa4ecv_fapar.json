    "description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'QA4ECV' | Can We Use Satellite-Based FAPAR to Detect Drought? | Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables | The FP7 QA4ECV project was initiated in 2014 to demonstrate how reliable and traceable quality information can be provided for satellite and ground-based measurements of climate and air quality parameters. The project developed and applied a Quality Assurance framework on new and improved multi-decadal data records of the Land ECVs Albedo, Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), and of the Atmosphere ECVs nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) | We encourage you to browse through the website and survey the scope of QA4ECV activities",
