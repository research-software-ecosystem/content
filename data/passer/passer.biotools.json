    "description": "Prediction of Allosteric Sites Server.\n\nTo approach this problem, PASSer is designed for accurate allosteric sites prediction. Ensemble learning, consisting of eXtreme gradient boosting and graph convolutional neural network, is used to learn the physical properties and topology information.\n\nAllostery is the process by which proteins transmit perturbations caused by the binding effect at one site to another distal site. Allosteric process is fundamental in regulation of activity. The identification of allosteric sites is important for allosteric drug development and has attracted a wide range of interests.",

                "abstract": "Allostery plays a crucial role in regulating protein activity, making it a highly sought-after target in drug development. One of the major challenges in allosteric drug research is the identification of allosteric sites. In recent years, many computational models have been developed for accurate allosteric site prediction. Most of these models focus on designing a general rule that can be applied to pockets of proteins from various families. In this study, we present a new approach using the concept of Learning to Rank (LTR). The LTR model ranks pockets based on their relevance to allosteric sites, that is, how well a pocket meets the characteristics of known allosteric sites. After the training and validation on two datasets, the Allosteric Database (ASD) and CASBench, the LTR model was able to rank an allosteric pocket in the top three positions for 83.6% and 80.5% of test proteins, respectively. The model outperforms other common machine learning models with higher F1 scores (0.662 in ASD and 0.608 in CASBench) and Matthews correlation coefficients (0.645 in ASD and 0.589 in CASBench). The trained model is available on the PASSer platform (https://passer.smu.edu) to aid in drug discovery research.",
