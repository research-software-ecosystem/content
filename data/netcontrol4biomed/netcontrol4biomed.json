Background: Network controllability focuses on discovering combinations of external interventions that can drive a biological system to a desired configuration. In practice, this approach translates into finding a combined multi-drug therapy in order to induce a desired response from a cell; this can lead to developments of novel therapeutic approaches for systemic diseases like cancer. Result: We develop a novel bioinformatics data analysis pipeline called NetControl4BioMed based on the concept of target structural control of linear networks. Our pipeline generates novel molecular interaction networks by combining pathway data from various public databases starting from the user's query. The pipeline then identifies a set of nodes that is enough to control a given, user-defined set of disease-specific essential proteins in the network, i.e., it is able to induce a change in their configuration from any initial state to any final state. We provide both the source code of the pipeline as well as an online web-service based on this pipeline http://combio.abo.fi/nc/net_control/remote_call.php. Conclusion: The pipeline can be used by researchers for controlling and better understanding of molecular interaction networks through combinatorial multi-drug therapies, for more efficient therapeutic approaches and personalised medicine.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Kanhaiya K."}, {"name": "Rogojin V."}, {"name": "Kazemi K."}, {"name": "Czeizler E."}, {"name": "Petre I."}], "date": "2018-07-09T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ion Petre", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ipetre@abo.fi"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:netcontrol4biomed", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://combio.abo.fi/research/network-controlability-project/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein-protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2464"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The pipeline can be used by researchers for controlling and better understanding of molecular interaction networks through combinatorial multi-drug therapies, for more efficient therapeutic approaches and personalised medicine.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["PHP", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://combio.abo.fi/nc/net_control/remote_call.php", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "netcontrol4biomed", "additionDate": "2018-07-29T11:25:53Z", "name": "NetControl4BioMed", "license": "BSD-2-Clause-FreeBSD", "documentation": [{"url": "http://combio.abo.fi/nc/net_control/documentation.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
