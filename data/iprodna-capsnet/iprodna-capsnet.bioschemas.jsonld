      "sc:description": "Identifying protein-DNA binding residues using capsule neural networks.\n\nSince protein-DNA interactions are highly essential to diverse biological events, accurately positioning the location of the DNA-binding residues is necessary. This biological issue, however, is currently a challenging task in the age of post-genomic where data on protein sequences have expanded very fast. In this study, we propose iProDNA-CapsNet -- a new prediction model identifying protein-DNA binding residues using an ensemble of Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) on position specific scoring matrix (PSMM) profiles. The use of CapsNets promises an innovative approach to determine the location of DNA-binding residues. In this study, the benchmark datasets introduced by Hu et al. (2017), i.e., PDNA-543 and PDNA-TEST, were used to train and evaluate the model, respectively. To fairly assess the model performance, comparative analysis between iProDNA-CapsNet and existing state-of-the-art methods was done",
