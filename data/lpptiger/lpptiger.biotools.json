                "abstract": "\u00a9 2017, The Author(s).Oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) have been recently recognized as important mediators of various and often controversial cellular functions and stress responses. Due to the low concentrations in vivo, oxPL detection is mostly performed by targeted mass spectrometry. Although significantly improving the sensitivity, this approach does not provide a comprehensive view on oxPLs required for understanding oxPL functional activities. While capable of providing information on the diversity of oxPLs, the main challenge of untargeted lipidomics is the absence of bioinformatics tools to support high-throughput identification of previously unconsidered, oxidized lipids. Here, we present LPPtiger, an open-source software tool for oxPL identification from data-dependent LC-MS datasets. LPPtiger combines three unique algorithms to predict oxidized lipidome, generate oxPL spectra libraries, and identify oxPLs from tandem MS data using parallel processing and a multi-scoring identification workflow.",
