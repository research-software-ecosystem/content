    "description": "a web portal that brings 3-D QSAR to all electronic devices-the Py-CoMFA web application as tool to build models from pre-aligned datasets.\n\nThe underlying idea of any field-based 3-D QSAR is that differences in a target propriety, e.g., biological activity, are often closely related to equivalent changes in shapes and intensities of noncovalent calculated interaction surrounding the molecules (also called molecular interaction fields, MIFs).\n\nIf you are interested the subscription to the portal is free and you can sign up using the link you find in the left menu.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE '3-D QSAR'",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA), introduced in 1988, was the first 3-D QSAR method ever published and sold. Since then thousands of application, articles and citation have proved 3-D QSAR as a valuable method to be used in drug design. Several other 3-D QSAR methods have appeared, but still CoMFA remains the most used and cited. Nevertheless from a survey on the Certara\u00ae web site it seems that CoMFA is no more available. Herein is presented a python implementation of the CoMFA (Py-CoMFA). Py-CoMFA is usable through the www.3d-qsar.com web applications suites portal by mean of any electronic device that can run a web browser. As benchmark, 30 different publicly available datasets were used to assess the Py-CoMFA usability and robustness. Comparisons with published results proved Py-COMFA to be in very good agreement with those obtained with the original CoMFA. Although the used datasets were pre-aligned, by means of the other web application available through the portal, 3-D QSAR models can be easily build from scratch. In conclusion, although CoMFA is a well known methodology and given the availability of several publicly available Hansch type QSAR web portals, Py-CoMFA represents a valuable tools for any chemoinformatics and informatics non-skilled user that can also be used as support to teach 3-D QSAR. Importantly, Py-CoMFA is the first and unique tool publicly available to build 3-D QSAR models.",
