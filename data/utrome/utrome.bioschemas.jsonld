The database provides detailed information on 3'UTR structures and alternative polyadenylation for all protein-coding mRNAs, and includes annotations extracted from other databases (such as WormBase and PicTar ) as well as new annotations generated by others.\n\n3'UTRs are important portions of mRNAs required for post-transcriptional regulation by interacting with proteins or non-coding RNAs (e.g. microRNAs). To study the role of 3'UTRs we are building a 3'UTR database for C. elegans .",
