Recently, partitioning the heritability accounted for by common variants into the contributions of genomic regions has received a lot of attention given its important applications for understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits. Current methods partition the total heritability by jointly estimating the contributions of all regions. However, these methods are computationally intractable and can be inaccurate when the number of regions is large. In this paper, we present an alternative approach that partitions the total heritability into the contributions of an arbitrary number of regions. We demonstrate by using simulations that our approach is more accurate and computationally efficient than current approaches. Using a data set from a genome-wide association study on human height, we demonstrate the utility of our method by estimating the heritability contributions of chromosomes and subchromosomal regions. \u00a9 2013 The American Society of Human Genetics.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Kostem E."}, {"name": "Eskin E."}], "date": "2013-04-04T00:00:00Z", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Emrah Kostem", "url": "http://zarlab.cs.ucla.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kostem@gmail.com"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Eleazar Eskin", "url": "http://zarlab.cs.ucla.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "eeskin@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:heidi", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/heritability/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3438"}, {"term": "Classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2990"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Linear mixed model based approach to partition the total heritability into the contributions of genomic regions.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/heidi-0-1-partition-the-total-heritability-into-the-contributions-of-genomic-regions.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "heidi", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:45:54Z", "name": "HEIDI", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/heritability/guide_heidi.html#Usage", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
