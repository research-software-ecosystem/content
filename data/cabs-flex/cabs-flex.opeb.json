In this application, the CABS model was shown to be a computationally efficient alternative to all-atom molecular dynamics--a classical simulation approach. The simulation method has been validated on a large set of molecular dynamics simulation data. Using a single input (user-provided file in PDB format), the CABS-flex server outputs an ensemble of protein models (in all-atom PDB format) reflecting the flexibility of the input structure, together with the accompanying analysis (residue mean-square-fluctuation profile and others). The ensemble of predicted models can be used in structure-based studies of protein functions and interactions.","authors":["Jamroz M.","Kolinski A.","Kmiecik S."],"cit_count":53,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23658222","title":"CABS-flex: Server for fast simulation of protein structure fluctuations.","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cabs-flex","biotoolsID":"cabs-flex","description":"Efficient procedure for the simulation of structure flexibility of folded globular proteins.","homepage":"http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex","name":"CABS-flex"}}
