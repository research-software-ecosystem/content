The design of an efficient DNA vaccine, involves choice of a suitable expression vector, ensuring optimal expression by codon optimization, engineering CpG motifs for enhancing immune responses and providing additional sequence signals for efficient translation. DyNAVacS is a web-based tool created for rapid and easy design of DNA vaccines. It follows a stepwise design flow, which guides the user through the various sequential steps in the design of the vaccine. Further, it allows restriction enzyme mapping, design of primers spanning user specified sequences and provides information regarding the vectors currently used for generation of DNA vaccines. The web version uses Apache HTTP server. The interface was written in HTML and utilizes the Common Gateway Interface scripts written in PERL for functionality. DyNAVacS is an integrated tool consisting of user-friendly programs, which require minimal information from the user.
