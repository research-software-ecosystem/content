  "sc:description": "a self-consistent method to impute single cell RNA sequencing data | I-Impute is a “self-consistent” method method to impute scRNA-seq data. I-Impute leverages continuous similarities and dropout probabilities and refines the data iteratively to make the final output \"self-consistent\". I-Impute exhibits robust imputation ability and follows the “self-consistency” principle. It offers perspicacity to uncover the underlying cell subtypes in real scRNA-Seq data",
