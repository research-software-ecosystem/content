I-Impute leverages continuous similarities and dropout probabilities and refines the data iteratively to make the final output \"self-consistent\". I-Impute exhibits robust imputation ability and follows the “self-consistency” principle. It offers perspicacity to uncover the underlying cell subtypes in real scRNA-Seq data","homepage":"https://github.com/xikanfeng2/I-Impute","name":"I-Impute"}}
