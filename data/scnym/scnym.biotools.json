    "description": "scNym - Semi-supervised adversarial neural networks for single cell classification.\n\nscNym is a neural network model for predicting cell types from single cell profiling data (e.g. scRNA-seq) and deriving cell type representations from these models. While cell type classification is the main use case, these models can map single cell profiles to arbitrary output classes (e.g. experimental conditions).",

Here, we present scNym, a semisupervised, adversarial neural network that learns to transfer cell identity annotations from one experiment to another. scNym takes advantage of information in both labeled data sets and new, unlabeled data sets to learn rich representations of cell identity that enable effective annotation transfer. We show that scNym effectively transfers annotations across experiments despite biological and technical differences, achieving performance superior to existing methods. We also show that scNym models can synthesize information from multiple training and target data sets to improve performance. We show that in addition to high accuracy, scNym models are well calibrated and interpretable with saliency methods.",
