Such solutions have to scale with the growing number and size of resources (e.g. available controlled vocabularies), with the amount of literature to be processed (e.g. about 17 million documents in PubMed) and with the demands of the user community (e.g. different methods for fact extraction). These demands motivated the development of a server-based solution for literature analysis. Whatizit is a suite of modules that analyse text for contained information, e.g. any scientific publication or Medline abstracts. Special modules identify terms and then link them to the corresponding entries in bioinformatics databases such as UniProtKb/Swiss-Prot data entries and gene ontology concepts. Other modules identify a set of selected annotation types like the set produced by the EBIMed analysis pipeline for proteins. In the case of Medline abstracts, Whatizit offers access to EBI's in-house installation via PMID or term query. For large quantities of the user's own text, the server can be operated in a streaming mode (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit) © 2007 The Author(s).","authors":["Rebholz-Schuhmann D.","Arregui M.","Gaudan S.","Kirsch H.","Jimeno A."],"cit_count":154,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btm557","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Text processing through web services: Calling Whatizit","type":"Primary","year":"2008-01-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:whatizit","biotoolsID":"whatizit","description":"A text processing system that allows you to do textmining tasks on text.
