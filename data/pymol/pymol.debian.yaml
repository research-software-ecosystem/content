summary: Molecular Graphics System
description: >
   PyMOL is a molecular graphics system targeted at medium to large
   biomolecules like proteins. It can generate high-quality publication-ready
   molecular graphics images and animations.
   .
   Features include:
    * Visualization of molecules, molecular trajectories and surfaces
      of crystallography data or orbitals
    * Molecular builder and sculptor
    * Internal raytracer and movie generator
    * Fully extensible and scriptable via a Python interface
   .
   File formats PyMOL can read include PDB, XYZ, CIF, MDL Molfile, ChemDraw,
   CCP4 maps, XPLOR maps and Gaussian cube maps.
