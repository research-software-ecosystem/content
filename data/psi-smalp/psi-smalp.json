    "description": "Detergent-free Cyanobacterial Photosystem I, Reveals Faster Femtosecond Photochemistry.\n\nCyanobacterial photosystem I (PSI) functions as a light-driven cyt c6-ferredoxin oxidoreductase located in the thylakoid membrane. In this work, the energy and charge transfer processes in PSI complexes isolated from Thermosynechococcus elongatus via conventional n-dodecyl-\u03b2-D-maltoside solubilization (DM-PSI) and a, to our knowledge, new detergent-free method using styrene-maleic acid copolymers (SMA-PSI) have been investigated by pump-to-probe femtosecond laser spectroscopy. In DM-PSI preparations excited at 740 nm, the excitation remained localized on the long-wavelength chlorophyll forms within 0.1-20 ps and revealed little or no charge separation and oxidation of the special pair, P700.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SMA-PSI', 'DM-PSI', 'P700', 'detergent-free SMA-PSI'",
