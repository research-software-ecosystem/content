    "description": "Utilizing Omics Data to Explore and Visualize Kinase-Substrate Interactions | Protein phosphorylation is one of the most prevalent post-translational modifications where kinases phosphorylate their selected substrates to maintain proper signal transduction in order to regulate cellular processes. Omic-Sig is developed to stratify phospho-substrates and their associated kinases by computing and ranking the differential abundances between paired samples (e.g., Tumor and its adjacent normal tissue). The differential abundances are calculated using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics and global proteomics data as well as transcriptome data from RNA-Seq. Omic-Sig also provides visualization of the computational results",
