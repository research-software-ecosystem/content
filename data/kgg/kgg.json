Motivation: Standard genome-wide association studies, testing the association between one phenotype and a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), are limited in two ways: (i) traits are often multivariate, and analysis of composite scores entails loss in statistical power and (ii) gene-based analyses may be preferred, e.g. to decrease the multiple testing problem. Results: Here we present a new method, multivariate gene-based association test by extended Simes procedure (MGAS), that allows gene-based testing of multivariate phenotypes in unrelated individuals. Through extensive simulation, we show that under most trait-generating genotype-phenotype models MGAS has superior statistical power to detect associated genes compared with gene-based analyses of univariate phenotypic composite scores (i.e. GATES, multiple regression), and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Re-analysis of metabolic data revealed 32 False Discovery Rate controlled genome-wide significant genes, and 12 regions harboring multiple genes; of these 44 regions, 30 were not reported in the original analysis. Conclusion: MGAS allows researchers to conduct their multivariate gene-based analyses efficiently, and without the loss of power that is often associated with an incorrectly specified genotype-phenotype models.", "citationCount": 18, "authors": [{"name": "Van Der Sluis S."}, {"name": "Dolan C.V."}, {"name": "Li J."}, {"name": "Song Y."}, {"name": "Sham P."}, {"name": "Posthuma D."}, {"name": "Li M.-X."}], "date": "2015-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr Li, Miaoxin", "url": "http://statgenpro.psychiatry.hku.hk/limx/homepage/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mxli@hku.hk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:kgg", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://statgenpro.psychiatry.hku.hk/limx/kgg/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Perform knowledge-based analysis for genome-wide association studies(GWAS).
