    "description": "From command-line bioinformatics to bioGUI.\n\nbioGUI provides install modules for bioinformatic software for users and allows developers to script a GUI for their applications.\n\nbioGUI: a universal GUI for CLI applications.\n\nTools for bioGUI (e.g. CWL Parser/argparse2biogui/...).\n\nWith bioGUI developers can easily build a graphical-user-interface (GUI) for their command-line only application. Such a GUI then enables many more people to use their software. Especially in biology, the domain experts are often computer novices and have difficulties using tools written for them by bioinformaticiens/computer scientists.\n\nbioGUI documentation — bioGUI documentation.\n\nAn python argparse-extension which first supplies two useful argparse-type extensions and second provides means to convert the python argparse parser into a bioGUI template.\n\nFree document hosting provided by Read the Docs",

                "abstract": "Copyright 2019 Joppich and ZimmerBioinformatics is a highly interdisciplinary field providing (bioinformatics) applications for scientists from many disciplines. Installing and starting applications on the command-line (CL) is inconvenient and/or inefficient for many scientists. Nonetheless, most methods are implemented with a command-line interface only. Providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for bioinformatics applications is one step toward routinely making CL-only applications available to more scientists and, thus, toward a more effective interdisciplinary work. With our bioGUI framework we address two main problems of using CL bioinformatics applications: First, many tools work on UNIX-systems only, while many scientists use Microsoft Windows. Second, scientists refrain from using CL tools which, however, could well support them in their research. With bioGUI install modules and templates, installing and using CL tools is made possible for most scientists—even on Windows, due to bioGUI’s support for Windows Subsystem for Linux. In addition, bioGUI templates can easily be created, making the bioGUI framework highly rewarding for developers. From the bioGUI repository it is possible to download, install and use bioinformatics tools with just a few clicks.",
