Finally, from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons. geneid offers some type of support to integrate predictions from multiple source via external gff files and the redefinition of the general gene structure or model is also feasible.

These sequences can be partially annotated, and geneid can be used to refine this initial annotation. Training geneid is relatively easy, and parameter configurations exist for a number of eukaryotic species. Geneid produces output in a variety of standard formats. The results, thus, can be processed by a variety of software tools, including visualization programs. Geneid software is in the public domain, and it is undergoing constant development. It is easy to install and use. Exhaustive benchmark evaluations show that geneid compares favorably with other existing gene finding tools.",

In the last step, from the set of predicted exons, the gene structure is assembled, maximizing the sum of the scores of the assembled exons. In this paper we describe the obtention of PWMs for sites, and the Markov model of coding DNA in Drosophila melanogaster. We also compare other model. Finally, we present and discuss the results obtained when GeneID is used to predict genes in the Adh region. These results show that the accuracy of GeneID predictions compares currently with that of other existing tools but that GeneID is likely to be more efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
