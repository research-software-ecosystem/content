description: A package for summary and annotation of genomic intervals. Users can
  visualize and quantify genomic intervals over pre-defined functional regions, such
  as promoters, exons, introns, etc. The genomic intervals represent regions with
  a defined chromosome position, which may be associated with a score, such as aligned
  reads from HT-seq experiments, TF binding sites, methylation scores, etc. The package
  can use any tabular genomic feature data as long as it has minimal information on
  the locations of genomic intervals. In addition, It can use BAM or BigWig files
  as input.
