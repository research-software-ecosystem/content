The integration is often hampered by a large variety of existing file formats, often containing similar information, and the necessity to use complicated tools to achieve the desired results. We have built an R package, genomation, to expedite the extraction of biological information from high throughput data. The package works with a variety of genomic interval file types and enables easy summarization and annotation of high throughput data sets with given genomic annotations.","authors":["Akalin A.","Franke V.","Vlahovicek K.","Mason C.E.","Schubeler D."],"cit_count":33,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu775","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25417204","title":"Genomation: A toolkit to summarize, annotate and visualize genomic intervals","type":"Primary","year":"2015-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:genomation","biotoolsID":"genomation","description":"A package for summary and annotation of genomic intervals. The genomic intervals represent regions with a defined chromosomic position, which may be associated with a score, such as aligned reads from HT-seq experiments, TF binding sites, methylation scores, etc. The package can use any tabular genomic feature data as long as it has minimal information on the locations of genomic intervals.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/genomation.html","name":"genomation","version":["1.6.0"]}}
