The software library 'mspire' - developed in the Ruby programming language - offers quick and memory-efficient readers for standard xml proteomics formats, converters for intermediate file types in typical proteomics spectral-identification work flows (including the Bioworks .srf format), and modules for the calculation of peptide false identification rates. © 2008 The Author(s).","authors":["Prince J.T.","Marcotte E.M."],"cit_count":17,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"18930952","title":"mspire: Mass spectrometry proteomics in Ruby","year":"2008-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mspire","biotoolsID":"mspire","description":"Full featured library for working with mass spectrometry data, particularly proteomic, metabolomic and lipidomic data sets.
