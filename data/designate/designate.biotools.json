    "description": "DeSignate is a tool for detecting diagnostic character positions for taxon diagnoses. The analysis is based on a novel representation of the gene sequence data, which enables a ranking of all positions according to their diagnostic relevance and a classification of the characters. DeSignate is also able to detect diagnostic combinations of characters. The tool guides the user step-by-step through the analysis and presents the results without need to post-process the output data.",

Nevertheless, taxon diagnoses are still widely restricted to morphological characters. The inclusion of molecular characters into taxon diagnoses is not only hampered by problems, such as their definition and the designation of their positions in a reference alignment, but also by the technical effort. Results: DeSignate is a tool for character-based taxon diagnoses that includes a novel ranking scheme. It detects and classifies individual and combined signature characters (diagnostic molecular characters) based on so-called character state vectors. An intuitive web application guides the user through the analysis process and provides the results at a glance. Further, formal definitions and a uniform terminology of characters are introduced. Conclusions: DeSignate facilitates the inclusion of diagnostic molecular characters and their positions to complement taxon diagnoses. Compared to previous solutions, the tool simplifies the workflow and improves reproducibility and traceability of the results. The tool is freely available as a web application at (https://designate.dbresearch.uni-salzburg.at/) and is open source (https://github.com/DatabaseGroup/DeSignate/).",
