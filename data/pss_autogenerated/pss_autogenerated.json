    "description": "> NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/pss | An enabling QTY server for designing water-soluble \u03b1-helical transmembrane proteins | Although the QTY/NTY code-based design is relative straightforward, the design job is still time-consuming if only a manual manner is available, especially for library design, which will be impractical without computing power. Here a web-based PSS sever was developed for facilitating the protein design based on the QTY/NTY code. This server is expected to be used widely by scientists who are endeavoring in the research about alpha-helical proteins | QTY/NTY Design for Protein Solubilizing | Membrane proteins play vital roles in all living systems",
