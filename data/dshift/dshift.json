Due to the presence of residual base stacking in these sequences, the temperature and sequence effects were investigated at 50 and 55\u00b0C. The phosphorus chemical shifts of random coil DNA sequences have been found to be independent of temperature. Sequence effect analysis shows that the phosphorus chemical shift of a nucleotide in a random coil DNA sequence depends on both its 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-nearest neighbors. A trimer model has been used to establish the random coil 31P chemical shift prediction protocol which shows an accuracy of 0.02 ppm. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Inc.
