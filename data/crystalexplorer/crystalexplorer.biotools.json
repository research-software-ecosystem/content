Over the past decade, significant changes and enhancements have been incorporated into the program, such as the capacity to accurately and quickly calculate and visualize quantitative intermolecular interactions and, perhaps most importantly, the ability to interface with the Gaussian and NWChem programs to calculate quantum-mechanical properties of molecules. The current version, CrystalExplorer21, incorporates these and other changes, and the software can be downloaded and used free of charge for academic research.",
