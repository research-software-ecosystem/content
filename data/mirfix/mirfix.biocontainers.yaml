description: MIRfix automatically curates miRNA datasets by improving alignments of
  their precursors, the consistency of the annotation of mature miR and miR* sequence,
  and the phylogenetic coverage. MIRfix produces alignments that are comparable across
  families and sets the stage for improved homology search as well as quantitative
  analyses.
