    "description": "PhaSePro is the comprehensive database of proteins driving liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in living cells. LLPS is a molecular process employed by all living organisms to form membraneless organelles, mediating crucial cellular functions. PhaSePro is manually curated, it is solely based on experimentally verified cases of LLPS, integrating a wide range of information on the biophysical driving forces, biological function and regulation of these molecular systems.",

                "abstract": "© 2019 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Membraneless organelles (MOs) are dynamic liquid condensates that host a variety of specific cellular processes, such as ribosome biogenesis or RNA degradation. MOs form through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process that relies on multivalent weak interactions of the constituent proteins and other macromolecules. Since the first discoveries of certain proteins being able to drive LLPS, it emerged as a general mechanism for the effective organization of cellular space that is exploited in all kingdoms of life. While numerous experimental studies report novel cases, the computational identification of LLPS drivers is lagging behind, and many open questions remain about the sequence determinants, composition, regulation and biological relevance of the resulting condensates. Our limited ability to overcome these issues is largely due to the lack of a dedicated LLPS database. Therefore, here we introduce PhaSePro (https://phasepro.elte.hu), an openly accessible, comprehensive, manually curated database of experimentally validated LLPS driver proteins/protein regions. It not only provides a wealth of information on such systems, but improves the standardization of data by introducing novel LLPS-specific controlled vocabularies. PhaSePro can be accessed through an appealing, user-friendly interface and thus has definite potential to become the central resource in this dynamically developing field.",
