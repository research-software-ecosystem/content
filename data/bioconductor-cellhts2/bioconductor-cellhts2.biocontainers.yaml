description: This package analyzes high-throughput assays performed in microtitre
  plate formats. the functionality includes data import and management, normalisation,
  quality assessment, replicate summarisation and statistical scoring. a webpage that
  provides a detailed graphical overview of the data and analysis results is produced.
  in our work, we have applied the package to rnai screens on fly and human cells,
  and for screens of yeast libraries.
