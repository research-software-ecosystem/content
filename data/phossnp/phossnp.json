Preliminary results from HapMap and other similar projects have revealed the existence of tremendous genetic variations among world populations and among individuals. It is important to delineate the functional implication of such variations, i.e. whether they affect the stability and biochemical properties of proteins. It is also generally believed that the genetic variation is the main cause for different susceptibility to certain diseases or different response to therapeutic treatments. Understanding genetic variation in the context of human diseases thus holds the promise for \"personalized medicine.\" In this work, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could potentially influence protein phosphorylation characteristics in human. Here, we defined a phosphorylation-related SNP (phosSNP) as a non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) that affects the protein phosphorylation status. Using an in-house developed kinase-specific phosphorylation site predictor (GPS 2.0), we computationally detected that \u223c70% of the reported nsSNPs are potential phosSNPs. More interestingly, \u223c74.6% of these potential phosSNPs might also induce changes in protein kinase types in adjacent phosphorylation sites rather than creating or removing phosphorylation sites directly. Taken together, we proposed that a large proportion of the nsSNPs might affect protein phosphorylation characteristics and play important roles in rewiring biological pathways. Finally, all phosSNPs were integrated into the PhosSNP 1.0 database, which was implemented in JAVA 1.5 (J2SE 5.0). The PhosSNP 1.0 database is freely available for academic researchers. \u00a9 2010 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", "citationCount": 50, "authors": [{"name": "Ren J."}, {"name": "Jiang C."}, {"name": "Gao X."}, {"name": "Liu Z."}, {"name": "Yuan Z."}, {"name": "Jin C."}, {"name": "Wen L."}, {"name": "Zhang Z."}, {"name": "Xue Y."}, {"name": "Yao X."}], "date": "2010-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Molecular and Cellular Proteomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yu Xue", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "xueyu@mail.hust.edu.cn"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jian Ren", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "renjian.sysu@gmail.com"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Zhaolei Zhang", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Zhaolei.Zhang@utoronto.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:phossnp", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://phossnp.biocuckoo.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling (mutation)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0331"}, {"term": "Genotyping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3196"}, {"term": "Protein post-translation modification site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"}, {"term": "SNP detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0484"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A database of phosphorylation-related SNP (phosSNP) which are non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) that affect the protein phosphorylation status.
