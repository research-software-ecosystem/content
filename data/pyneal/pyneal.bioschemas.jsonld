      "sc:description": "Pyneal is an open source software package to support real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is entirely Python-based and depends exclusively on free, open source neuroimaging libraries.\n\nThis repository contains a set of tutorials to accompany the Pyneal real-time fMRI software package. For more information on Pyneal, please see Pyneal Docs.\n\nIn order to help with the initial setup, as well as test any analysis scripts and network communications later on, Pyneal includes a suite of simulation tools that mimic various inputs and outputs along the data flow path.\n\nThis respository contains representative data from GE, Siemens, and Philips scanning environments. For a detailed, step-by-step walk-through on setting up and running Pyneal across each of these environments, please see link above.",
