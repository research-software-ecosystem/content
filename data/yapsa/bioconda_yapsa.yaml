description: This package provides functions and routines useful in the analysis of
  somatic signatures (cf. L. Alexandrov et al., Nature 2013). In particular, functions
  to perform a signature analysis with known signatures (LCD = linear combination
  decomposition) and a signature analysis on stratified mutational catalogue (SMC
  = stratify mutational catalogue) are provided.
