Since its last publication in the NAR webserver issue in 2008, a new generation of peptide:MHC binding and T-cell epitope predictive tools have been added. As validated by different labs and in the first international competition for predicting peptide:MHC-I binding, their predictive performances have improved considerably. In addition, a new B-cell epitope prediction tool was added, and the homology mapping tool was updated to enable mapping of discontinuous epitopes onto 3D structures. Furthermore, to serve a wider range of users, the number of ways in which IEDB-AR can be accessed has been expanded. Specifically, the predictive tools can be programmatically accessed using a web interface and can also be downloaded as software packages. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 171, "authors": [{"name": "Kim Y."}, {"name": "Ponomarenko J."}, {"name": "Zhu Z."}, {"name": "Tamang D."}, {"name": "Wang P."}, {"name": "Greenbaum J."}, {"name": "Lundegaard C."}, {"name": "Sette A."}, {"name": "Lund O."}, {"name": "Bourne P.E."}, {"name": "Nielsen M."}, {"name": "Peters B."}], "date": "2012-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "IEDB Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "help@iedb.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:iedb-ar", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://tools.immuneepitope.org", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Epitope mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0416"}, {"term": "Mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2429"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The Immune Epitope Database Analysis Resource (IEDB-AR) is a collection of tools for the prediction and analysis of immune epitopes.
