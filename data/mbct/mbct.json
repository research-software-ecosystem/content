    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | the accessibility and implementation of an effective depression relapse prevention programme in UK NHS services | OBJECTIVES:Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based approach for people at risk of depressive relapse to support their long-term recovery. However, despite its inclusion in guidelines, there is an 'implementation cliff'. The study objective was to develop a better explanation of what facilitates MBCT implementation. SETTING:UK primary and secondary care mental health services. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS:A national two-phase, multi-method qualitative study was conducted, which was conceptually underpinned by the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Phase I involved interviews with stakeholders from 40 service providers about current provision of MBCT. Phase II involved 10 purposively sampled case studies to obtain a more detailed understanding of MBCT implementation",
