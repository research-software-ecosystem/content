  "sc:description": "The Alternative Splicing Gallery (ASG) takes an identifier such as an EnsEMBL gene ID or a RefSeq ID as input, and provides a graph mapping splice events to transcript information. The user can also view GO information for the record, and select one or more exons and download the resulting sequence. ASG also links out to other alternative splicing databases like ProSplicer.",
