Results: We present an R/Bioconductor port of a fast novel algorithm for Bayesian agglomerative hierarchical clustering and demonstrate its use in clustering gene expression microarray data. The method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering, using a Dirichlet Process (infinite mixture) to model uncertainty in the data and Bayesian model selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge. Conclusion: Biologically plausible results are presented from a well studied data set: expression profiles of A. thaliana subjected to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. Our method avoids several limitations of traditional methods, for example how many clusters there should be and how to choose a principled distance metric. \u00a9 2009 Savage et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 29, "authors": [{"name": "Savage R.S."}, {"name": "Heller K."}, {"name": "Xu Y."}, {"name": "Ghahramani Z."}, {"name": "Truman W.M."}, {"name": "Grant M."}, {"name": "Denby K.J."}, {"name": "Wild D.L."}], "date": "2009-08-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Rich Savage", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "r.s.savage@warwick.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bhc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.26.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BHC.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This method performs bottom-up hierarchical clustering using a Dirichlet Process to model uncertainty in the data and a Bayesian model selection to decide at each step which clusters to merge.
