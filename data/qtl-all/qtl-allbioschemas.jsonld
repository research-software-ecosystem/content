  "sc:description": "QTL linkage analysis program. It calculates a wide variety of QTL linkage statistics for nuclear families. Score statistics are emphasized, as are statistics appropriate for ascertained (nonpopulation) samples such as concordant and discordant sibling pairs. Currently, only sib-pair and sibship data are supported, but we plan to extend the capability to arbitrary pedigrees soon.",
