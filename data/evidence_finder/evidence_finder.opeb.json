It locates sentences that present evidence in the text of research papers. Sentences from 1.5M papers in the UPMC corpus are indexed based on linguistic analysis and NER.

On selecting a question, the user may review details of the documents containing the evidence, including the indexed sentences.","homepage":"http://www.nactem.ac.uk/UKPMCWS/EvidenceFinder.html","name":"Evidence Finder"}}
