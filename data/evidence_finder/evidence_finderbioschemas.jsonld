Sentences from 1.5M papers in the UPMC corpus are indexed based on linguistic analysis and NER. Initial search results take the form of questions representing the most frequent types of relevant evidence in the index. On selecting a question, the user may review details of the documents containing the evidence, including the indexed sentences.",
