            "abstract": "Gene Ontology (GO) analysis has become a commonly used approach for functional studies of large-scale genomic or transcriptomic data. Although there have been a lot of software with GO-related analysis functions, new tools are still needed to meet the requirements for data generated by newly developed technologies or for advanced analysis purpose. Here, we present a Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis Software Toolkit (GOEAST), an easy-to-use web-based toolkit that identifies statistically overrepresented GO terms within given gene sets. Compared with available GO analysis tools, GOEAST has the following improved features: (i) GOEAST displays enriched GO terms in graphical format according to their relationships in the hierarchical tree of each GO category (biological process, molecular function and cellular component), therefore, provides better understanding of the correlations among enriched GO terms; (ii) GOEAST supports analysis for data from various sources (probe or probe set IDs of Affymetrix, Illumina, Agilent or customized microarrays, as well as different gene identifiers) and multiple species (about 60 prokaryote and eukaryote species); (iii) One unique feature of GOEAST is to allow cross comparison of the GO enrichment status of multiple experiments to identify functional correlations among them. GOEAST also provides rigorous statistical tests to enhance the reliability of analysis results. GOEAST is freely accessible at http://omicslab.genetics.ac.cn/GOEAST/",
