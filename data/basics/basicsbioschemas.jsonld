  "sc:description": "Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model to perform statistical analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets in the context of supervised experiments. It could perform built-in data normalisation and technical noise quantification. BASiCS provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly variable genes within a single group of cells. Also, it can compare gene expression patterns between two or more pre-specified groups of cells.",
