Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: Here, we present MetaBridge, a tool that collates protein interactors (curated metabolite-enzyme interactions) that influence the levels of specific metabolites including both bio-synthetic and degradative enzymes. This enables network-based integrative analysis of metabolomics data with other omics data types. MetaBridge is designed to complement a systems-biology approach to analysis, pairing well with network analysis tools such as NetworkAnalyst.ca, but can be used in any bioinformatics workflow.","authors":["Hinshaw S.J.","Lee A.H.Y.","Gill E.E.","Hancock R.E.W."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty331","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"MetaBridge: Enabling network-based integrative analysis via direct protein interactors of metabolites","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metabridge","biotoolsID":"metabridge","description":"Enabling network-based integrative analysis via direct protein interactors of metabolites.","homepage":"https://www.metabridge.org/","name":"MetaBridge"}}
