      "sc:description": "A Repository of Predicted RNA Modifications in Plants.\n\nEpitranscriptomics is an emerging field that studies the function of RNA base modifications in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expressions. So far, over 150 RNA modifications catalyzed by distinct enzymes have been documented. PRMdb is a plant RNA modification database, which is based on analysis of thousands of RNA-seq datasets, small RNA-seq and degradome-seq datasets from various plant species using the tool HAMR (High-throughput Analysis of Modified Ribonucleotides) (Kuksa et al., 2017; Ryvkin et al., 2013).\n\nThe raw sequencing data used to create PRMdb are downloaded from NCBI SRA/GEO, Plant MPSS db or sRNA db at Danforth Center. Plant genomes and annotations were derived from JGI phytozyme or Ensembl Plants.\n\nFull List of Datasets Used to Create PRMdb.\n\nThe sequencing data used to create PRMdb are derived from NCBI, Plant MPSS db or sRNA data at Danforth Center.",
