        "description": "Chemical map–based prediction of nucleosome positioning using the Bioconductor package nuCpos.\n\nAbstract Background Methods for predicting nucleosome positioning include bioinformatics, biophysical, and combined approaches. An advantage of bioinformatics methods, which are based on in vivo nucleosome maps, is the use of natural sequences that may contain previously unknown elements involved in nucleosome positioning in vivo. The accuracy of such prediction attempts reflects the genomic coordinate resolution of the nucleosome maps applied. Thus, nucleosome maps constructed using Micrococcus nuclease (MNase), which has a strong preference for A T-rich sequences, may not be appropriate for this purpose. In addition to MNase seq based maps, base pair resolution chemical maps of in vivo nucleosomes from three different species (budding and fission yeasts, and mouse) are currently available.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
