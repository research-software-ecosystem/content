  "sc:description": "An automated bioinformatics pipeline for SNP assay development which increases the probability of generating homoeologue-specific assays for polyploid wheat. PolyMarker generates a multiple alignment between the target SNP sequence and the IWGSC chromosome survey sequences (IWGSC, 2014 ) for each of the three wheat genomes. It then generates a mask with informative positions which are highlighted with respect to the target genome.",
