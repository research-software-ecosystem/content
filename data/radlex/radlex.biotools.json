                "abstract": "Background: The implementation of a collective terminology in radiological reporting such as the RSNA radiological lexicon (RadLex) yields many benefits including unambiguous communication of findings, improved education, and fostering data mining for research purposes. While some fields in general radiology have already been evaluated so far, this is the first exploratory approach to assess the applicability of the RadLex terminology to glioblastoma (GBM) MRI reporting. Methods: Preoperative brain MRI reports of 20 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed GBM (mean age 68.4 ± 10.8 years; 12 males) between January and October 2010 were retrospectively identified. All terms related to the tumor as well as their frequencies of mention were extracted from the MRI reports by two independent neuroradiologists. Every item was subsequently analyzed with respect to an equivalent RadLex representation and classified into one of four groups as follows: 1. verbatim RadLex entity, 2. synonymous/multiple equivalent(s), 3. combination of RadLex concepts, or 4. no RadLex equivalent. Additionally, verbatim entities were categorized using the hierarchical RadLex Tree Browser. Results: A total of 160 radiological terms were gathered. 123/160 (76.9%) items showed literal RadLex equivalents, 9/160 (5.6%) items had synonymous (non-verbatim) or multiple counterparts, 21/160 (13.1%) items were represented by means of a combination of concepts, and 7/160 (4.4%) entities could not eventually be transferred adequately into the RadLex ontology. Conclusions: Our results suggest a sufficient term coverage of the RadLex terminology for GBM MRI reporting. If applied extensively, it may improve communication of radiological findings and facilitate data mining for large-scale research purposes.",
