                "abstract": "RNA–RNA interactions are a key feature of post-transcriptional gene regulation in all domains of life. While ever more experimental protocols are being developed to study RNA duplex formation on a genome-wide scale, computational methods for the analysis and interpretation of the underlying data are lagging behind. Here, we present ChimericFragments, an analysis framework for RNA-seq experiments that produce chimeric RNA molecules. ChimericFragments implements a novel statistical method based on the complementarity of the base-pairing RNAs around their ligation site and provides an interactive graph-based visualization for data exploration and interpretation. ChimericFragments detects true RNA–RNA interactions with high precision and is compatible with several widely used experimental procedures such as RIL-seq, LIGR-seq or CLASH. We further demonstrate that ChimericFragments enables the systematic detection of novel RNA regulators and RNA–target pairs with crucial roles in microbial physiology and virulence. ChimericFragments is written in Julia and available at: https://github.com/maltesie/ ChimericFragments.",
