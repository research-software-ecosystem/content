    "description": "a web-based chemical repository of flavonoid compounds.\n\nFlavonoids are richly diverse polyphenolic plant secondary metabolites that are known to be crucial component of human diet. These compounds are attributed with variety of nutritional as well as therapeutic value. Flavonoids are often known for their effective antioxidant nature; however, their various other bioactivities are well established. These bioactivities mainly includes antibacterial, anti-cancer, cardio protective, promotion of immune system, anti-inflammatory and skin protection from ultra violet radiation; these properties are effectively reviewed by Tungmunnithum et al 2018.\n\nPlethora of literature has piled up in recent decades that demonstrates various bioactivities of these flavonoids.\n\nFlavonoids have a typical tri-ringed flavone as a main chemical scaffold consisting fused heterocyclic chromen moiety (Ring A and C) attached to phenyl group (Ring B)",
