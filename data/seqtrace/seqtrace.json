Relatively few nonproprietary software tools are available to assist with this process. SeqTrace is a new, free, and open-source software application that is designed to automate the entire workflow by facilitating easy batch processing of large numbers of trace files. SeqTrace can identify, align, and compute consensus sequences from matching forward and reverse traces, filter low-quality base calls, and end-trim finished sequences. The software features a graphical interface that includes a full-featured chromatogram viewer and sequence editor. SeqTrace runs on most popular operating systems and is freely available, along with supporting documentation, at http://seqtrace. googlecode.com/.\u00a9 2012 ABRF.", "citationCount": 86, "authors": [{"name": "Stucky B.J."}], "date": "2012-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Biomolecular Techniques"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://sites.google.com/site/robgur/home2", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "stuckyb@colorado.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:seqtrace", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://code.google.com/p/seqtrace/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2403"}, {"term": "Chromatogram visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3203"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-11-13T19:49:19Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Application for viewing and processing DNA sequencing chromatograms (trace files).
