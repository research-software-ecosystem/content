The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development of scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R, Bioconductor comprises 934 interoperable packages contributed by a large, diverse community of scientists. Packages cover a range of bioinformatic and statistical applications. They undergo formal initial review and continuous automated testing. We present an overview for prospective users and contributors.","authors":["Huber W.","Carey V.J.","Gentleman R.","Anders S.","Carlson M.","Carvalho B.S.","Bravo H.C.","Davis S.","Gatto L.","Girke T.","Gottardo R.","Hahne F.","Hansen K.D.","Irizarry R.A.","Lawrence M.","Love M.I.","MaCdonald J.","Obenchain V.","Oles A.K.","Pages H.","Reyes A.","Shannon P.","Smyth G.K.","Tenenbaum D.","Waldron L.","Morgan M."],"cit_count":671,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3252","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor","type":"Other","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pwmenrich","biotoolsID":"pwmenrich","description":"A toolkit of high-level functions for DNA motif scanning and enrichment analysis built upon Biostrings. The main functionality is PWM enrichment analysis of already known PWMs (e.g. from databases such as MotifDb), but the package also implements high-level functions for PWM scanning and visualisation. The package does not perform \"de novo\" motif discovery, but is instead focused on using motifs that are either experimentally derived or computationally constructed by other tools.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PWMEnrich.html","name":"PWMEnrich","version":["4.10.0"]}}
