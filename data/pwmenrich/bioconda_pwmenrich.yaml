description: A toolkit of high-level functions for DNA motif scanning and enrichment
  analysis built upon Biostrings. The main functionality is PWM enrichment analysis
  of already known PWMs (e.g. from databases such as MotifDb), but the package also
  implements high-level functions for PWM scanning and visualisation. The package
  does not perform "de novo" motif discovery, but is instead focused on using motifs
  that are either experimentally derived or computationally constructed by other tools.
