                "abstract": "We explored DNA structures of genomes by means of a new tool derived from the 'chaotic dynamical systems' theory (the so-called chaos game representation [CGR]), which allows the depiction of frequencies of oligonucleotides in the form of images. Using CGR, we observe that subsequences of a genome exhibit the main characteristics of the whole genome, attesting to the validity of the genomic signature concept. Base concentrations, stretches (runs of complementary bases or purines/pyrimidines), and patches (over- or underexpressed words of various lengths) are the main factors explaining the variability observed among sequences. The distance between images may be considered a measure of phylogenetic proximity. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes can be identified merely on the basis of their DNA structures.",
