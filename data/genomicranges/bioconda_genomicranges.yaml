description: The ability to efficiently represent and manipulate genomic annotations
  and alignments is playing a central role when it comes to analyzing high-throughput
  sequencing data (a.k.a. NGS data). The GenomicRanges package defines general purpose
  containers for storing and manipulating genomic intervals and variables defined
  along a genome. More specialized containers for representing and manipulating short
  alignments against a reference genome, or a matrix-like summarization of an experiment,
  are defined in the GenomicAlignments and SummarizedExperiment packages, respectively.
  Both packages build on top of the GenomicRanges infrastructure.
