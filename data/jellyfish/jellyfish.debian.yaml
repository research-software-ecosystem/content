description: JELLYFISH is a tool for fast, memory-efficient counting of k-mers in
  DNA. A k-mer is a substring of length k, and counting the occurrences of all such
  substrings is a central step in many analyses of DNA sequence. JELLYFISH can count
  k-mers using an order of magnitude less memory and an order of magnitude faster
  than other k-mer counting packages by using an efficient encoding of a hash table
  and by exploiting the "compare-and-swap" CPU instruction to increase parallelism.
  . JELLYFISH is a command-line program that reads FASTA and multi-FASTA files containing
  DNA sequences. It outputs its k-mer counts in an binary format, which can be translated
  into a human-readable text format using the "jellyfish dump" command. . This is
  the latest version of the 1.x series of jellyfish which is used by some other applications
  that are not compatible with version 2.x which is provided inside the jellyfish
  package.
