These enzymes catalyze the covalent ligation of chromophores (phycobilins) to specific binding sites of phycobiliproteins (PBPs). The latter constitute the building bricks of phycobilisomes, the major light-harvesting systems of cyanobacteria and red algae. Phycobilin lyases sequences are poorly annotated in public databases. Sequences included in CyanoLyase were retrieved from all available genomes of these organisms and a few others by similarity searches using biochemically characterized enzyme sequences and then classified into 3 clans and 32 families. Amino acid motifs were computed for each family using Protomata learner. CyanoLyase also includes BLAST and a novel pattern matching tool (Protomatch) that allow users to rapidly retrieve and annotate lyases from any new genome. In addition, it provides phylogenetic analyses of all phycobilin lyases families, describes their function, their presence/absence in all genomes of the database (phyletic profiles) and predicts the chromophorylation of PBPs in each strain. The site also includes a thorough bibliography about phycobilin lyases and genomes included in the database. This resource should be useful to scientists and companies interested in natural or artificial PBPs, which have a number of biotechnological applications, notably as fluorescent markers. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2012.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Bretaudeau A."}, {"name": "Coste F."}, {"name": "Humily F."}, {"name": "Garczarek L."}, {"name": "Le Corguille G."}, {"name": "Six C."}, {"name": "Ratin M."}, {"name": "Collin O."}, {"name": "Schluchter W.M."}, {"name": "Partensky F."}], "date": "2013-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "GenOuest", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "GenOuest", "url": "http://www.genouest.org", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "support@genouest.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cyanolyase", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://cyanolyase.genouest.org/", "function": [{"note": "Motif occurence detection in protein sequences", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0253"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence signature matches", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0858"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}]}, {"note": "Protein sequence alignment against known family members", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0338"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0863"}, "format": [{"term": "BLAST results", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1333"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Manually curated sequence and amino acid motif database gathering all the different phycobilin lyases and related protein sequences available in public databases.", "toolType": ["Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "cyanolyase", "additionDate": "2015-01-21T15:12:20Z", "name": "CyanoLyase", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://cyanolyase.genouest.org/help", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
