Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: Current methods for motif discovery from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data often identify non-targeted transcription factor (TF) motifs, and are even further limited when peak sequences are similar due to common ancestry rather than common binding factors. The latter aspect particularly affects a large number of proteins from the Cys2His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) class of TFs, as their binding sites are often dominated by endogenous retroelements that have highly similar sequences. Here, we present recognition code-assisted discovery of regulatory elements (RCADE) for motif discovery from C2H2-ZF ChIP-seq data. RCADE combines predictions from a DNA recognition code of C2H2-ZFs with ChIP-seq data to identify models that represent the genuine DNA binding preferences of C2H2-ZF proteins. We show that RCADE is able to identify generalizable binding models even from peaks that are exclusively located within the repeat regions of the genome, where state-of-the-art motif finding approaches largely fail.",
