Published by Oxford University Press. Summary: Current methods for motif discovery from chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) data often identify non-targeted transcription factor (TF) motifs, and are even further limited when peak sequences are similar due to common ancestry rather than common binding factors. The latter aspect particularly affects a large number of proteins from the Cys2His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) class of TFs, as their binding sites are often dominated by endogenous retroelements that have highly similar sequences. Here, we present recognition code-assisted discovery of regulatory elements (RCADE) for motif discovery from C2H2-ZF ChIP-seq data. RCADE combines predictions from a DNA recognition code of C2H2-ZFs with ChIP-seq data to identify models that represent the genuine DNA binding preferences of C2H2-ZF proteins. We show that RCADE is able to identify generalizable binding models even from peaks that are exclusively located within the repeat regions of the genome, where state-of-the-art motif finding approaches largely fail.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Najafabadi H.S."}, {"name": "Albu M."}, {"name": "Hughes T.R."}], "date": "2015-02-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://hsnajafabadi.wordpress.com/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hamed.najafabadi@utoronto.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rcade-recognition", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rcade.ccbr.utoronto.ca/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Recognition Code-Assisted Discovery of regulatory Elements combines predictions from a DNA recognition code of C2H2-ZFs with ChIP-seq data to identify models that represent the genuine DNA binding prefer-ences of C2H2-ZF proteins.", "toolType": ["Library", "Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/rcade-recognition-code-assisted-discovery-of-regulatory-elements.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "rcade-recognition", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:57:31Z", "name": "RCADE", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/hsnajafabadi/rcade", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
