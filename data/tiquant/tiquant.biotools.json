It includes a number of versatile image and volume processing chains tailored to the analysis of different tissue types which have been experimentally verified. TiQuant implements a novel method for the reconstruction of three-dimensional surfaces of biological systems, data that often cannot be obtained experimentally but which is of utmost importance for tissue modelling in systems biology.",
