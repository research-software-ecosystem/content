Motivation: TiQuant is a modular software tool for efficient quantification of biological tissues based on volume data obtained by biomedical image modalities. It includes a number of versatile image and volume processing chains tailored to the analysis of different tissue types which have been experimentally verified. TiQuant implements a novel method for the reconstruction of three-dimensional surfaces of biological systems, data that often cannot be obtained experimentally but which is of utmost importance for tissue modelling in systems biology.", "citationCount": 19, "authors": [{"name": "Friebel A."}, {"name": "Neitsch J."}, {"name": "Johann T."}, {"name": "Hammad S."}, {"name": "Hengstler J.G."}, {"name": "Drasdo D."}, {"name": "Hoehme S."}], "date": "2015-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://msysbio.com/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "dittmann@izbi.uni-leipzig.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tiquant", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.msysbio.com/tiquant", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Image analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A modular software tool for efficient quantification of biological tissues based on volume data obtained by biomedical image modalities.
