We present a threading-recombination approach, COTH, to boost the protein complex structure library by combining tertiary structure templates with complex alignments. The query sequences are first aligned to complex templates using a modified dynamic programming algorithm, guided by ab initio binding-site predictions. The monomer alignments are then shifted to the multimeric template framework by structural alignments. COTH was tested on 500 nonhomologous dimeric proteins, which can successfully detect correct templates for 50% of the cases after homologous templates are excluded, which significantly outperforms conventional homology modeling algorithms. It also shows a higher accuracy in interface modeling than rigid-body docking of unbound structures from ZDOCK although with lower coverage. These data demonstrate new avenues to model complex structures from nonhomologous templates. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", "citationCount": 84, "authors": [{"name": "Mukherjee S."}, {"name": "Zhang Y."}], "date": "2011-07-13T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Structure"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yang Zhang", "url": "http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yangzhanglab@umich.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bspred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/BSpred/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Neural network based algorithm for predicting binding site of proteins from amino acid sequences.
