    "description": "an integrated database and analytic platform for de novo mutations in humans.\n\nDe novo mutations (DNMs) significantly contribute to sporadic diseases, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide effective methods for detecting DNMs and prioritizing candidate genes. However, it remains a challenge for scientists, clinicians, and biologists to conveniently access and analyse data regarding DNMs and candidate genes from scattered publications. To fill the unmet need, we integrated 580 799 DNMs, including 30 060 coding DNMs detected by WES WGS from 23 951 individuals across 24 phenotypes and prioritized a list of candidate genes with different degrees of statistical evidence, including 346 genes with false discovery rates <0.05. We then developed a database called Gene4Denovo (http: www.genemed.tech gene4denovo ), which allowed these genetic data to be conveniently catalogued, searched, browsed, and analysed",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.De novo mutations (DNMs) significantly contribute to sporadic diseases, particularly in neuropsychiatric disorders. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provide effective methods for detecting DNMs and prioritizing candidate genes. However, it remains a challenge for scientists, clinicians, and biologists to conveniently access and analyse data regarding DNMs and candidate genes from scattered publications. To fill the unmet need, we integrated 580 799 DNMs, including 30 060 coding DNMs detected by WES/WGS from 23 951 individuals across 24 phenotypes and prioritized a list of candidate genes with different degrees of statistical evidence, including 346 genes with false discovery rates <0.05. We then developed a database called Gene4Denovo (http://www.genemed.tech/gene4denovo/), which allowed these genetic data to be conveniently catalogued, searched, browsed, and analysed. In addition, Gene4Denovo integrated data from >60 genomic sources to provide comprehensive variant-level and gene-level annotation and information regarding the DNMs and candidate genes. Furthermore, Gene4Denovo provides end-users with limited bioinformatics skills to analyse their own genetic data, perform comprehensive annotation, and prioritize candidate genes using custom parameters. In conclusion, Gene4Denovo conveniently allows for the accelerated interpretation of DNM pathogenicity and the clinical implication of DNMs in humans.",
