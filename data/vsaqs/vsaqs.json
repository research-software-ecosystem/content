    "description": "A Novel Approach To Summative Assessments In Pathology.\n\nBackground:A solid understanding of the science underpinning treatment is essential for all doctors. Pathology teaching and assessment are fundamental components of the undergraduate medicine curriculum. Assessment drives learning and the choice of assessments influences students' learning behaviours. The use of multiple-choice questions is common but is associated with significant cueing and may promote \"rote learning\". Essay-type questions and Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) are resource-intensive in terms of delivery and marking and do not allow adequate sampling of the curriculum.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'VSAQs SBAQs EMQs', 'Very Short Answer questions', 'VSAQs SBAQs', 'SBAQs EMQs'",
