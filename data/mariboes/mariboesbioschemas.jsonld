It has many applications, for example to complete reconstructed metabolic networks, to aid in metabolic engineering or to help identify unknown peaks in mass spectra. It employs structural and stereochemistry similarity measures and molecular fingerprints to generalise enzymatic reactions based on data available in BRENDA.",
