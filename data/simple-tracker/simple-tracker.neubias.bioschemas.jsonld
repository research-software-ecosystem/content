  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>SIMPLETRACKER a simple particle tracking algorithm that can deal with gaps.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTracking , or particle linking, consist in re-building the trajectories of one or several particles as they move along time. Their position is reported at each frame, but their identity is yet unknown: we do not know what particle in one frame corresponding to a particle in the previous&nbsp;frame. Tracking algorithms aim at providing a solution for this problem.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nsimpletracker.m is - as the name says - a simple implementation of a tracking algorithm, that can deal with gaps. A gap happens when one&nbsp;particle that was detected in one frame is not detected in the subsequent one. If not dealt with, this generates a track break, or a gap, in the frame where the particle disappear, and a false new track in the frame&nbsp;where it re-appear.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
