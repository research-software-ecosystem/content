description: "Detects splice junctions from RNA-seq data. This method does not depend\
  \ on any existing annotation of gene structures and is capable of finding novel\
  \ splice junctions with high sensitivity and specificity. It can handle long reads\
  \ (50\u2013100 nt) and can exploit paired-read information to improve mapping accuracy."
