Efficient identity-by-descent (IBD)-based sibpair linkage tests are available that test individual markers or maps of linked markers for linkage to a single putative susceptibility gene. In order to assess the support for linkage to a second putative susceptibility gene that happens to map close to an established susceptibility gene, it is necessary to use a method that correctly allows for the IBD distortion that directly results from the linkage between the two genes. A maximum likelihood-based, multilocus linkage test is proposed, which accounts for this interdependency and evaluates the support for an interaction between constituent susceptibility genes. The size and power of a test for a second linked susceptibility gene is investigated by simulation studies.","authors":["Farrall M."],"cit_count":42,"journal":"Genetic Epidemiology","pmid":"9129957","title":"Affected sibpair linkage tests for multiple linked susceptibility genes","year":"1997-05-06"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:twoloc","biotoolsID":"twoloc","description":"Software package for analyzing two-locus susceptibility gene models in affected sib-pair data.","homepage":"http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~mfarrall/twoloc.htm","name":"TWOLOC"}}
