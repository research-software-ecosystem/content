  "sc:description": "This package allows to reconstruct features of pathways from the nested structure of perturbation effects. It takes as input a set of pathway components, which were perturbed, and a phenotypic readout of these perturbations (e.g. gene expression, protein expression). The output is a directed graph representing the phenotypic hierarchy.",
