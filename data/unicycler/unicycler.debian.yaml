description: Unicycler is an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. It can assemble
  Illumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser. It can also assembly
  long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it runs a miniasm+Racon pipeline.
  For the best possible assemblies, give it both Illumina reads and long reads, and
  it will conduct a hybrid assembly.
