The ABA Application enables users to access an extensive database of high resolution in situ hybridization (ISH) images from over 10,000 genes, reference atlases in both the sagittal and coronal planes, gene expression masks capturing the intensity of gene expression or signal, and the ability to search for gene expression by anatomic region.",
