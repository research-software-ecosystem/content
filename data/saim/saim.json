    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TIRF', 'azimuthal', 'microscopy', 'firmware' | High-speed device synchronization in optical microscopy with an open-source hardware control platform | Check out the preprint at https://doi.org/10.1101/533349 for more details | This project has been developed in house by the Paszek and Zipfel labs at Cornell University over a few years and several revisions. The primary developer has been Marshall Colville (mjc449@cornell.edu) with assistance from Warren Zipfel and Matt Paszek | Given the scope of the project, the multiple revisions and adaptations that the hardware and software have gone through, and the fact that we are not electrical or software engineers the code tends to change styles and not follow typical conventions",
