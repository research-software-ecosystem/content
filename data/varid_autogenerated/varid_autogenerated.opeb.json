Here, I introduce VarID, a computational method that identifies locally homogenous neighborhoods in cell state space, permitting the quantification of local variability in gene expression. VarID delineates neighborhoods with differential gene expression variability and reveals pseudo-temporal dynamics of variability during differentiation.","authors":["Grun D."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1038/S41592-019-0632-3","journal":"Nature Methods","pmid":"31740822","title":"Revealing dynamics of gene expression variability in cell state space","year":"2020-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:VarID_autogenerated","biotoolsID":"VarID_autogenerated","description":"Revealing dynamics of gene expression variability in cell state space.\n\nVarID analysis of murine hematopoietic progenitors and intestinal epithelial cells.
