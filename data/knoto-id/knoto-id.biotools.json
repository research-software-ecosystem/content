To study their entanglement, a common strategy consists in searching for the presence of knots in their backbones using topological invariants. However, this approach requires to close the curve into a loop, which alters the geometry of curve. Knoto-ID allows evaluating the entanglement of open curves without the need to close them, using the recent concept of knotoids which is a generalization of the classical knot theory to open curves. Knoto-ID can analyse the global topology of the full chain as well as the local topology by exhaustively studying all subchains or only determining the knotted core. Knoto-ID permits to localize topologically non-trivial protein folds that are not detected by informatics tools detecting knotted protein folds.",
