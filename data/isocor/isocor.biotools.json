    "description": "IsoCor is a scientific software dedicated to the correction of low- and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) data for naturally occuring isotopes. IsoCor corrects raw MS data (mass fractions) for naturally-occurring isotopes of all elements and purity of the isotopic tracer. The output of IsoCor is the isotopologue distribution of the molecule (i.e. the relative fractions of molecular entities differing only in the number of isotopic substitutions of the tracer). IsoCor also calculates the mean enrichment (i.e. the mean isotopic content in the molecule) in metabolites.",

All rights reserved.Summary: Mass spectrometry (MS) is widely used for isotopic studies of metabolism and other (bio)chemical processes. Quantitative applications in systems and synthetic biology require to correct the raw MS data for the contribution of naturally occurring isotopes. Several tools are available to correct low-resolution MS data, and recent developments made substantial improvements by introducing resolution-dependent correction methods, hence opening the way to the correction of high-resolution MS (HRMS) data. Nevertheless, current HRMS correction methods partly fail to determine which isotopic species are resolved from the tracer isotopologues and should thus be corrected. We present an updated version of our isotope correction software (IsoCor) with a novel correction algorithm which ensures to accurately exploit any chemical species with any isotopic tracer, at any MS resolution. IsoCor v2 also includes a novel graphical user interface for intuitive use by end-users and a command-line interface to streamline integration into existing pipelines. Availability and implementation: IsoCor v2 is implemented in Python 3 and was tested on Windows, Unix and MacOS platforms.
