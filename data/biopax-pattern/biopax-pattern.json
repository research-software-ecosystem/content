Owing to the inherent complexity of a BioPAX model, searching for a specific type of subnetwork can be non-trivial and difficult.Results: We developed an open source and extensible framework for defining and searching graph patterns in BioPAX models. We demonstrate its use with a sample pattern that captures directed signaling relations between proteins. We provide search results for the pattern obtained from the Pathway Commons database and compare these results with the current data in signaling databases SPIKE and SignaLink. Results show that a pattern search in public pathway data can identify a substantial amount of signaling relations that do not exist in signaling databases.Availability: BioPAX-pattern software was developed in Java.
