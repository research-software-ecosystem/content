Coverage can be analyzed per locus, per interval, per gene, or in total; can be partitioned by sample, by read group, by technology, by center, or by library; and can be summarized by mean, median, quartiles, and/or percentage of bases covered to or beyond a threshold. Additionally, reads and bases can be filtered by mapping or base quality score.",
