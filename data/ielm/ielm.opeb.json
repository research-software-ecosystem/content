However, the function of many of these interactions remains elusive. The interactions of Eukaryotic Linear Motif (iELM) web server provides a resource for predicting the function and positional interface for a subset of interactions mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs). The iELM prediction algorithm is based on the annotated SLiM classes from the Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource and allows users to explore both annotated and user-generated PPI networks for SLiM-mediated interactions. By incorporating the annotated information from the ELM resource, iELM provides functional details of PPIs. This can be used in proteomic analysis, for example, to infer whether an interaction promotes complex formation or degradation. Furthermore, details of the molecular interface of the SLiM-mediated interactions are also predicted. This information is displayed in a fully searchable table, as well as graphically with the modular architecture of the participating proteins extracted from the UniProt and Phospho.ELM resources. A network figure is also presented to aid the interpretation of results. The iELM server supports single protein queries as well as large-scale proteomic submissions and is freely available at http://i.elm.eu.org. © 2012 The Author(s).","authors":["Weatheritt R.J.","Jehl P.","Dinkel H.","Gibson T.J."],"cit_count":21,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22638578","title":"iELM-a web server to explore short linear motif-mediated interactions","year":"2012-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ielm","biotoolsID":"ielm","description":"iELM webserver predicts the function and positional interface for short linear motifs important in protein-protein interactions.","homepage":"http://i.elm.eu.org","name":"iELM"}}
