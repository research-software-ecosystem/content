MaxLink, a guilt-by-association network search algorithm, has been made available as a web resource and a stand-alone version. Based on a user-supplied list of query genes, MaxLink identifies and ranks genes that are tightly linked to the query list. This functionality can be used to predict potential disease genes from an initial set of genes with known association to a disease. The original algorithm, used to identify and rank novel genes potentially involved in cancer, has been updated to use a more statistically sound method for selection of candidate genes and made applicable to other areas than cancer. The algorithm has also been made faster by re-implementation in C++, and the Web site uses FunCoup 3.0 as the underlying network. Availability and implementation: MaxLink is freely available at http://maxlink.sbc.su.se both as a web service and a stand-alone application for download.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Guala D."}, {"name": "Sjolund E."}, {"name": "Sonnhammer E.L.L."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dimitri Guala", "url": "http://www.sbc.su.se/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "dimitri.guala@scilifelab.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:maxlink", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://maxlink.sbc.su.se/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3439"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Thus tool find and rank cancer gene candidates by their connectivity to known cancer genes.
