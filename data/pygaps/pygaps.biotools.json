    "description": "pyGAPS is a Python-Based Framework for Adsorption Isotherm Processing and Material Characterisation.\n\nMaterial characterisation through adsorption is a widely-used laboratory technique. The isotherms obtained through volumetric or gravimetric experiments impart insight through their features but can also be analysed to determine material characteristics such as specific surface area, pore size distribution, surface energetics, or used for predicting mixture adsorption. The pyGAPS (python General Adsorption Processing Suite) framework was developed to address the need for high-throughput processing of such adsorption data, independent of the origin, while also being capable of presenting individual results in a user-friendly manner.",
