The studies on lncRNA-protein interactions are of great value to the understanding of lncRNA functional mechanisms. In this paper, we proposed a novel model to predict potential lncRNA-protein interactions using the SKF (similarity kernel fusion) and LapRLS (Laplacian regularized least squares) algorithms. We named this method the LPI-SKF. Various similarities of both lncRNAs and proteins were integrated into the LPI-SKF. LPI-SKF can be applied in predicting potential interactions involving novel proteins or lncRNAs. We obtained an AUROC (area under receiver operating curve) of 0.909 in a 5-fold cross-validation, which outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. A total of 19 out of the top 20 ranked interaction predictions were verified by existing data, which implied that the LPI-SKF had great potential in discovering unknown lncRNA-protein interactions accurately. All data and codes of this work can be downloaded from a GitHub repository (https://github.com/zyk2118216069/LPI-SKF).",
