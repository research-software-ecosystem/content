An automated simulator with stable and reliable performance is especially useful and in great request. Here we introduce the CATKINAS package developed for large-scale microkinetic modeling and analysis. Featuring with a multilevel solver and a multifunctional analyzer, CATKINAS can provide both accurate solutions and various quantitative and automatic analysis for a wide range of catalytic systems. The structure and the basic workflow are overviewed with the multilevel solver particularly illustrated. Also, we take the CO methanation reaction as an example to illustrate the application and efficiency of the CATKINAS package.",
