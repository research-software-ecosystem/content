      "sc:description": "The massive molecular profiling of thousands of cancer patients has led to the identification of many tumor type specific driver genes. However, only a few (or none) of them are present in each individual tumor and, to enable precision oncology, we need to interpret the alterations found in a single patient. Cancer PanorOmics (http://panoromics.irbbarcelona.org) is a web-based resource to contextualize genomic variations detected in a personal cancer genome within the body of clinical and scientific evidence available for 26 tumor types, offering complementary cohort and patient-centric views. Additionally, it explores the cellular environment of mutations by mapping them on the human interactome and providing quasiatomic structural details, whenever available. This ‘PanorOmic’ molecular view of individual tumors should contribute to the identification of actionable alterations ultimately guiding the clinical decision-making process.",
