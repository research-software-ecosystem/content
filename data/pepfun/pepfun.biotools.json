The package has been created under the python scripting language based on built-in functions and methods available in the open source projects BioPython and RDKit. Some of the prediction and characterization tools were tested with two datasets of peptide binders of known protein systems, the MHC class II and the Granzyme B protease.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Peptide research has increased during the last years due to their applications as biomarkers, therapeutic alternatives or as antigenic sub-units in vaccines. The implementation of computational resources have facilitated the identification of novel sequences, the prediction of properties, and the modelling of structures. However, there is still a lack of open source protocols that enable their straightforward analysis. Here, we present PepFun, a compilation of bioinformatics and cheminformatics functionalities that are easy to implement and customize for studying peptides at different levels: sequence, structure and their interactions with proteins. PepFun enables calculating multiple characteristics for massive sets of peptide sequences, and obtaining different structural observables derived from protein-peptide complexes. In addition, random or guided library design of peptide sequences can be customized for screening campaigns. The package has been created under the python language based on built-in functions and methods available in the open source projects BioPython and RDKit. We present two tutorials where we tested peptide binders of the MHC class II and the Granzyme B protease.",
