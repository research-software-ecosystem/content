    "description": "HASTEN is a tool that makes it easier to run machine learning boosted virtual screening workflows. It is written in very general Python without relying in non-standard libraries so it is easy to run in any Python environment\n\nCurrently only chemprop is supported as machine learning method, but it is easy to write Shell-scripts to plug-in your own methods. Glide from Schrodinger is supported in this version, but the same applies here: it should be easy to plug-in your own docking program. Do note that the HASTEN assumes that the smaller the docking score, the better the score.\n\nThere is also simulation mode, which allows you to run benchmarks using existing docking_scores without in reality doing anything in 3D. This mode can be useful when adjusting the machine learning parameters.",

It has been validated using datasets both from literature (12 datasets, each containing three million molecules docked with FRED) and in-house sources (one dataset of four million compounds docked with Glide). HASTEN showed reasonable performance by having the mean recall value of 0.78 of the top one percent scoring molecules after docking 10 % of the dataset for the literature data, whereas excellent recall value of 0.95 was achieved for the in-house data. The program can be used with any docking- and machine learning methodology, and is freely available from https://github.com/TuomoKalliokoski/HASTEN.",
