Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: During lead compound optimization, it is crucial to identify pathways where a drug-like compound is metabolized. Recently, machine learning-based methods have achieved inspiring progress to predict potential metabolic pathways for drug-like compounds. However, they neglect the knowledge that metabolic pathways are dependent on each other. Moreover, they are inadequate to elucidate why compounds participate in specific pathways. Results: To address these issues, we propose a novel Multi-Label Graph Learning framework of Metabolic Pathway prediction boosted by pathway interdependence, called MLGL-MP, which contains a compound encoder, a pathway encoder and a multi-label predictor. The compound encoder learns compound embedding representations by graph neural networks. After constructing a pathway dependence graph by re-trained word embeddings and pathway co-occurrences, the pathway encoder learns pathway embeddings by graph convolutional networks. Moreover, after adapting the compound embedding space into the pathway embedding space, the multi-label predictor measures the proximity of two spaces to discriminate which pathways a compound participates in. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods on KEGG pathways demonstrates the superiority of our MLGL-MP. Also, the ablation studies reveal how its three components contribute to the model, including the pathway dependence, the adapter between compound embeddings and pathway embeddings, as well as the pre-training strategy. Furthermore, a case study illustrates the interpretability of MLGL-MP by indicating crucial substructures in a compound, which are significantly associated with the attending metabolic pathways. It is anticipated that this work can boost metabolic pathway predictions in drug discovery.",
