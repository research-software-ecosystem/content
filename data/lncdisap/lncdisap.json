    "description": "a computation model for LncRNA-disease association prediction based on multiple biological datasets.\n\nBACKGROUND:Over the past decades, a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified. Growing evidence has indicated that the mutation and dysregulation of lncRNAs play a critical role in the development of many complex human diseases. Consequently, identifying potential disease-related lncRNAs is an effective means to improve the quality of disease diagnostics and treatment, which is the motivation of this work. Here, we propose a computational model (LncDisAP) for potential disease-related lncRNA identification based on multiple biological datasets. First, the associations between lncRNA and different data sources are collected from different databases. With these data sources as dimensions, we calculate the functional associations between lncRNAs by the recommendation strategy of collaborative filtering.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
