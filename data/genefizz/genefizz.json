There appears to be a varying degree of coincidence for different genomes between the two types of segmentations, from almost perfect to non-relevant. Following these two extremes, GeneFizz can be used for two purposes: ab initio physics-based identification of new genes (as recently shown for Plasmodium falciparum) or the exploration of possible evolutionary signals revealed by the discrepancies observed between the two types of information.", "citationCount": 18, "authors": [{"name": "Yeramian E."}, {"name": "Jones L."}], "date": "2003-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "11836228", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Physics-based gene identification: Proof of concept for plasmodium falciparum", "abstract": "The ab initio prediction of new genes in eukaryotic genomes represents a difficult task, notably for the identification of complex split genes. A Physics-Based Gene Identification (PBGI) method was formulated recently (Yeramian, Gene, 255, 139-150, 151-168, 2000a,b) to address this problem, taking as a model the Plasmodium falciparum genome. Here, the predictive power of this method is put under experimental test for this genome. The presented results demonstrate the usefulness of the PBGI as a gene-identification tool for P. falciparum, notably for the discovery of new genes with no homology to known genes.
