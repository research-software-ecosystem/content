description: R package for building and running automated end-to-end analysis workflows
  for a wide range of next generation sequence (NGS) applications such as RNA-Seq,
  ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Important features include a uniform workflow interface
  across different NGS applications, automated report generation, and support for
  running both R and command-line software, such as NGS aligners or peak/variant callers,
  on local computers or compute clusters. Efficient handling of complex sample sets
  and experimental designs is facilitated by a consistently implemented sample annotation
  infrastructure. Instructions for using systemPipeR are given in the Overview Vignette
  (HTML). The remaining Vignettes, linked below, are workflow templates for common
  NGS use cases.
