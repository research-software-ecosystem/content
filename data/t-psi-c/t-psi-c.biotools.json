                "abstract": "tRNAs have been widely studied for their role as genetic code decoders in the ribosome during translation, but have recently received new attention due to the discovery of novel roles beyond decoding, often in connection with human diseases. Yet, existing tRNA databases have not been updated for more than a decade, so they do not contain this new functional information and have not kept pace with the rate of discovery in this field. Therefore, a regularly updated database that contains information about newly discovered characteristics of tRNA molecules and can be regularly updated is strongly needed. Here, we report the creation of the T-psi-C database (http://tpsic.igcz.poznan.pl), an up-to-date collection of tRNA sequences that contains data obtained from high-throughput tRNA sequencing, e.g. all isoacceptors and isodecoders for human HEK293 cells. This database also contains 3D tRNA structures obtained from Protein Data Bank and generated using homology modeling. The T-psi-C database can be continuously updated by any member of the scientific community, and contains its own application programming interface (API), which allows users to retrieve or upload data in JSON format. Altogether, T-psi-C is user-friendly, easy to develop and an up-to-date source of knowledge about tRNAs.",
