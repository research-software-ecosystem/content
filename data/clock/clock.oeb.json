        "description": "An epigenetic clock for human skeletal muscle.\n\nAbstract Background Ageing is associated with DNA methylation changes in all human tissues, and epigenetic markers can estimate chronological age based on DNA methylation patterns across tissues. However, the construction of the original pan-tissue epigenetic clock did not include skeletal muscle samples, and hence exhibited a strong deviation between DNA methylation and chronological age in this tissue. Methods To address this, we developed a more accurate, muscle-specific epigenetic clock based on the genome-wide DNA methylation data of 682 skeletal muscle samples from 12 independent datasets (18-89 years old, 22% women, 99% Caucasian), all generated with Illumina HumanMethylation arrays (HM27, HM450 or HMEPIC).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MEAT', 'pan-tissue clock', 'muscle clock', 'muscle'",
