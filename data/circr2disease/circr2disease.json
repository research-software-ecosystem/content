    "description": "Predicting circRNA-Disease Associations Based on Improved Collaboration Filtering Recommendation System With Multiple Data.\n\nMarch 31, 2018, the CircR2Disease has been updated.\n\nCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in diverse eukaryotic species and are characterized by covalently closed RNA loops through backsplicing events. They are known to function as miRNA sponges, regulators of alternative splicing, transcription factors and protein-coding templates for translation. To date, dysregulation of circRNAs have been associated with a group of diseases, i.e. various cancer. Here, CircR2Disease curated a database for experimentally supported associations between circRNAs and diseases, providing a platform for investigating mechanism of the disease-related circRNAs.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ICFCDA'",
