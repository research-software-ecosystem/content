biotools_id: paircompviz
description: This package provides visualization of the results from the multiple
  (i.e. pairwise) comparison tests such as pairwise.t.test, pairwise.prop.test or
  pairwise.wilcox.test. The groups being compared are visualized as nodes in Hasse
  diagram. Such approach enables very clear and vivid depiction of which group is
  significantly greater than which others, especially if comparing a large number
  of groups.
