The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development of scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R, Bioconductor comprises 934 interoperable packages contributed by a large, diverse community of scientists. Packages cover a range of bioinformatic and statistical applications. They undergo formal initial review and continuous automated testing. We present an overview for prospective users and contributors.","authors":["Huber W.","Carey V.J.","Gentleman R.","Anders S.","Carlson M.","Carvalho B.S.","Bravo H.C.","Davis S.","Gatto L.","Girke T.","Gottardo R.","Hahne F.","Hansen K.D.","Irizarry R.A.","Lawrence M.","Love M.I.","MaCdonald J.","Obenchain V.","Oles A.K.","Pages H.","Reyes A.","Shannon P.","Smyth G.K.","Tenenbaum D.","Waldron L.","Morgan M."],"cit_count":671,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3252","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor","type":"Other","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:paircompviz","biotoolsID":"paircompviz","description":"This package provides visualization of the results from the multiple (i.e. pairwise) comparison tests such as pairwise.t.test, pairwise.prop.test or pairwise.wilcox.test. The groups being compared are visualized as nodes in Hasse diagram. Such approach enables very clear and vivid depiction of which group is significantly greater than which others, especially if comparing a large number of groups.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/paircompviz.html","name":"paircompviz","version":["1.12.0"]}}
