For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: The C++ library Highly Optimized Polytope Sampling (HOPS) provides implementations of efficient and scalable algorithms for sampling convex-constrained models that are equipped with arbitrary target functions. For uniform sampling, substantial performance gains were achieved compared to the state-of-the-art. The ease of integration and utility of non-uniform sampling is showcased in a Bayesian inference setting, demonstrating how HOPS interoperates with third-party software. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Source code is available at https://github.com/modsim/hops/, tested on Linux and MS Windows, includes unit tests, detailed documentation, example applications and a Dockerfile. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
