To allow a quick search for components in the mixtures, a special type of display has been developed that shows all the data obtained in an analysis run simultaneously. On the screen, the m/z information from the mass scan (in the x direction) and the time (as scan number, in the y direction) are displayed with mass peaks given as single points. The relative intensity of a signal is colour coded. Thus, it is easy to recognize analyte signals as bright islands in a dark surrounding; even weak signals in the vicinity of strong background ions are identified quite clearly. Additionally, the program incorporates some features to allow a simple operation and very fast investigation of the data.
