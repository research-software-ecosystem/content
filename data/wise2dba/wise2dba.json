This set was used to analyze the degree of conservation of noncoding sequences between mouse and human. A new alignment algorithm was developed to cope with the fact that large parts of noncoding sequences are not alignable in a meaningful way because of genetic drift. This new algorithm, DNA Block Aligner (DBA), finds colinear-conserved blocks that are flanked by nonconserved sequences of varying lengths. The noncoding regions of the data set were aligned with DBA. The proportion of the noncoding regions covered by blocks > 60% identical was 36% for upstream regions, 50% for 5' UTRs, 23% for introns, and 56% for 3' UTRs. These blocks of high identity were more or less evenly distributed across the length of the features, except for upstream regions in which the first 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site was covered in up to 70% of the gene pairs. This data set complements earlier sets on the basis of cDNA sequences and will be useful for further comparative studies.", "citationCount": 158, "authors": [{"name": "Jareborg N."}, {"name": "Birney E."}, {"name": "Durbin R."}], "date": "1999-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Web Production", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Ewan Birney", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "EMBL-EBI", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Web Production", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "es-request@ebi.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:wise2dba", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/wise2dba/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Nucleic acid sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2977"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Pairwise sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0491"}, {"term": "Local alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0495"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence alignment (nucleic acid)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1383"}, "format": []}, {"data": {"term": "Sequence alignment (pair)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1381"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Align two sequences assuming the sequences share colinear conserved blocks separated by gaps.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/", "note": null, "type": "Helpdesk"}], "biotoolsID": "wise2dba", "additionDate": "2015-01-29T15:47:36Z", "name": "Wise2DBA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use", "note": null, "type": "Terms of use"}, {"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/wise2dba/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
