Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Exposome-Explorer (http://exposome-explorer.iarc.fr) is a database of dietary and pollutant biomarkers measured in population studies. In its first release, Exposome-Explorer contained comprehensive information on 692 biomarkers of dietary and pollution exposures extracted from the analysis of 480 peer-reviewed publications. Today, Exposome-Explorer has been further expanded and contains a total of 908 biomarkers. Two additional types of information have been collected. First, 185 candidate dietary biomarkers having 403 associations with food intake (as measured by metabolomic studies) have been identified and added. Second, 1356 associations between dietary biomarkers and cancer risk in epidemiological studies, which were collected from 313 publications, have also been added to the database. Classifications for both foods and compounds have been revised, and new classifications for biospecimens, analytical methods and cancers have been implemented. Finally, the web interface has been redesigned to significantly improve the user experience.",
