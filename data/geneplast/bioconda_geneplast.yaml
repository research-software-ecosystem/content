description: Geneplast is designed for evolutionary and plasticity analysis based
  on orthologous groups distribution in a given species tree. It uses Shannon information
  theory and orthologs abundance to estimate the Evolutionary Plasticity Index. Additionally,
  it implements the Bridge algorithm to determine the evolutionary root of a given
  gene based on its orthologs distribution.
