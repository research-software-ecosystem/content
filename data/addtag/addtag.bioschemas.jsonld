      "sc:description": "AddTag is a two-step approach with supporting software package that facilitates CRISPR/Cas-mediated precision genome editing.\n\nCRISPR Cas-induced genome editing is a powerful tool for genetic engineering, however, targeting constraints limit which loci are editable with this method. Since the length of a DNA sequence impacts the likelihood it overlaps a unique target site, precision editing of small genomic features with CRISPR Cas remains an obstacle. We introduce a two-step genome editing strategy that virtually eliminates CRISPR Cas targeting constraints and facilitates precision genome editing of elements as short as a single base-pair at virtually any locus in any organism that supports CRISPR Cas-induced genome editing. Our two-step approach first replaces the locus of interest with an \"AddTag\" sequence, which is subsequently replaced with any engineered sequence, and thus circumvents the need for direct overlap with a unique CRISPR Cas target site.",
