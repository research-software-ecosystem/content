                "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Genetics Society of America.Eagle is an R package for multi-locus association mapping on a genome-wide scale. It is unlike other multi-locus packages in that it is easy to use for R users and non-users alike. It has two modes of use, command line and graphical user interface. Eagle is fully documented and has its own supporting website, http://eagle.r-forge.r-project.org/index.html. Eagle is a significant improvement over the method-of-choice, single-locus association mapping. It has greater power to detect SNP-trait associations. It is based on model selection, linear mixed models, and a clever idea on how random effects can be used to identify SNP-trait associations. Through an example with real mouse data, we demonstrate Eagle's ability to bring clarity and increased insight to single-locus findings. Initially, we see Eagle complementing single-locus analyses. However, over time, we hope the community will make, increasingly, multi-locus association mapping their method-of-choice for the analysis of genome-wide association study data.",
