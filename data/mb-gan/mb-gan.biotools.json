    "description": "To address the challenge of simulating realistic microbiome data, we designed a novel simulation framework termed MB-GAN, by using a generative adversarial network (GAN) and utilizing methodology advancements from the deep learning community. MB-GAN can automatically learn from a given microbial abundances and compute simulated abundances that are indistinguishable from it. In practice, MB-GAN showed the following advantages. First, MB-GAN avoids explicit statistical modeling assumptions, and it only requires real datasets as inputs. Second, unlike the traditional GANs, MB-GAN is easily applicable and can converge efficiently. MB-GAN is freely available at: https://github.com/zhanxw/MB-GAN",
