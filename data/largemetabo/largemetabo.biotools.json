For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Large-scale metabolomics is a powerful technique that has attracted widespread attention in biomedical studies focused on identifying biomarkers and interpreting the mechanisms of complex diseases. Despite a rapid increase in the number of large-scale metabolomic studies, the analysis of metabolomic data remains a key challenge. Specifically, diverse unwanted variations and batch effects in processing many samples have a substantial impact on identifying true biological markers, and it is a daunting challenge to annotate a plethora of peaks as metabolites in untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Therefore, the development of an out-of-the-box tool is urgently needed to realize data integration and to accurately annotate metabolites with enhanced functions. In this study, the LargeMetabo package based on R code was developed for processing and analyzing large-scale metabolomic data. This package is unique because it is capable of (1) integrating multiple analytical experiments to effectively boost the power of statistical analysis; (2) selecting the appropriate biomarker identification method by intelligent assessment for large-scale metabolic data and (3) providing metabolite annotation and enrichment analysis based on an enhanced metabolite database. The LargeMetabo package can facilitate flexibility and reproducibility in large-scale metabolomics. The package is freely available from https://github.com/LargeMetabo/LargeMetabo.",
