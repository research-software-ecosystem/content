This is achieved by the site-specific integration of a modified plasmid at a chosen locus of the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, through the use of the Cre lox recombination system. In the present work, we have used our method to insert a single UV lesion into the yeast genome, and studied how the balance between error-free and error-prone lesion bypass is regulated. We show that the inhibition of homologous recombination, either directly (by the inactivation of Rad51 recombinase) or through its control by preventing the polyubiquitination of PCNA (ubc13 mutant), leads to a strong increase in the use of Trans Lesion Synthesis (TLS)","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31418026","name":"iDamage"}}
