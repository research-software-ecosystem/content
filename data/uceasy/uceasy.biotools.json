This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY 4.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background The use of Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs) as genetic markers in phylogenomics has become popular and has provided promising results. Although UCE data can be easily obtained from targeted enriched sequencing, the protocol for in silico analysis of UCEs consist of the execution of heterogeneous and complex tools, a challenge for scientists without training in bioinformatics. Developing tools with the adoption of best practices in research software can lessen this problem by improving the execution of computational experiments, thus promoting better reproducibility. New information We present UCEasy, an easy-to-install and easy-to-use software package with a simple command line interface that facilitates the computational analysis of UCEs from sequencing samples, following the best practices of research software. UCEasy is a wrapper that standardises, automates and simplifies the quality control of raw reads, assembly and extraction and alignment of UCEs, generating at the end a data matrix with different levels of completeness that can be used to infer phylogenetic trees. We demonstrate the functionalities of UCEasy by reproducing the published results of phylogenomic studies of the bird genus Turdus (Aves) and of Adephaga families (Coleoptera) containing genomic datasets to efficiently extract UCEs.",
