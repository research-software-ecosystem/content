When done by hand, this characterization can become tedious, especially when many complexes need be analyzed. In order to facilitate the characterization of ligand binding, we here present a novel Python-implemented computer algorithm called BINANA (BINding ANAlyzer), which is freely available for download at http://www.nbcr.net/binana/. To demonstrate the utility of the new algorithm, we use BINANA to confirm that the number of hydrophobic contacts between a ligand and its protein receptor is positively correlated with ligand potency. Additionally, we show how BINANA can be used to search through a large ligand-receptor database to identify those complexes that are remarkable for selected binding features, and to identify lead candidates from a virtual screen with specific, desirable binding characteristics. We are hopeful that BINANA will be useful to computational chemists and structural biologists who wish to automatically characterize many ligand-receptor complexes for key binding characteristics. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "citationCount": 78, "authors": [{"name": "Durrant J.D."}, {"name": "McCammon J.A."}], "date": "2011-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Graphics and Modelling"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jacob Durrant", "url": "https://amarolab.ucsd.edu/~jdurrant/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jdurrant@ucsd.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:binana", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://nbcr.ucsd.edu/data/sw/hosted/binana/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "BINding ANAlyzer is a python-implemented algorithm for analyzing ligand binding.
