description: A sizable genomics study such as microarray often involves the use of
  multiple batches (groups) of experiment due to practical complication. To minimize
  batch effects, a careful experiment design should ensure the even distribution of
  biological groups and confounding factors across batches. OSAT (Optimal Sample Assignment
  Tool) is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples to different
  batches. With minimum steps, it produces setup that optimizes the even distribution
  of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches, reducing the
  confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables of interest.
  It can also optimize the even distribution of confounding factors across batches.
  Our tool can handle challenging instances where incomplete and unbalanced sample
  collections are involved as well as ideal balanced RCBD. OSAT provides a number
  of predefined layout for some of the most commonly used genomics platform. Related
