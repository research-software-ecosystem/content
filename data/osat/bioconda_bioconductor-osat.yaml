  description: A sizable genomics study such as microarray often involves the use
    of multiple batches (groups) of experiment due to practical complication. To minimize
    batch effects, a careful experiment design should ensure the even distribution
    of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. OSAT (Optimal Sample
    Assignment Tool) is developed to facilitate the allocation of collected samples
    to different batches. With minimum steps, it produces setup that optimizes the
    even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest into different batches,
    reducing the confounding or correlation between batches and the biological variables
    of interest. It can also optimize the even distribution of confounding factors
    across batches. Our tool can handle challenging instances where incomplete and
    unbalanced sample collections are involved as well as ideal balanced RCBD. OSAT
    provides a number of predefined layout for some of the most commonly used genomics
    platform. Related paper can be find at http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/689
