  "sc:description": "It is a collection of carbohydrates, artificial sweeteners and other sweet tasting agents like proteins and peptides. Structural information and properties such as number of calories, therapeutic annotations and a sweetness-index are stored in SuperSweet. The database provides a modeled 3D structure of the sweet taste receptor and binding poses of the small sweet molecules. A sweetener classification tree and browsing features allow quick requests to be made to the database.",
