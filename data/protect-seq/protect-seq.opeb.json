        "description": "genome-wide profiling of nuclease inaccessible domains reveals physical properties of chromatin.\n\nIn metazoan cell nuclei, heterochromatin constitutes large chromatin domains that are in close contact with the nuclear lamina. These heterochromatin lamina-associated domains (LADs) domains are difficult to profile and warrants a simpler and direct method. Here we report a new method, Protect-seq, aimed at identifying regions of heterochromatin via resistance to nuclease degradation followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). We performed Protect-seq on the human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 and observed overlap with previously curated LADs. We provide evidence that these protected regions are enriched for and can distinguish between the repressive histone modification H3K9me3, H3K9me2 and H3K27me3. Moreover, in human cells the loss of H3K9me3 leads to an increase in chromatin accessibility and loss of Protect-seq signal.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
