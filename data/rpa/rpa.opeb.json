While existing approaches detect noisy probes based on external information such as genomic alignments, we introduce and validate a targeted probabilistic method for analyzing probe reliability directly from expression data and independently of the noise source. This provides insights into the various sources of probe-level noise and gives tools to guide probe design. © 2011 IEEE.","authors":["Lahti L.","Elo L.L.","Aittokallio T.","Kaski S."],"cit_count":22,"doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2009.38","journal":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pmid":"21071809","title":"Probabilistic analysis of probe reliability in differential gene expression studies with short Oligonucleotide arrays","type":"Primary","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rpa","biotoolsID":"rpa","description":"Probabilistic analysis of probe reliability and differential gene expression on short oligonucleotide arrays.
