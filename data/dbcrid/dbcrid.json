Investigations of diseaseassociated CR events can not only lead to important discoveries about DNA breakage and repair mechanisms, but also offer important clues about the pathologic causes and the diagnostic/therapeutic targets of these diseases. We have developed a database of Chromosomal Rearrangements In Diseases (dbCRID, http://dbCRID.biolead.org), a comprehensive database of human CR events and their associated diseases. For each reported CR event, dbCRID documents the type of the event, the disease or symptoms associated, and-when possible-detailed information about the CR event including precise breakpoint positions, junction sequences, genes and gene regions disrupted and experimental techniques applied to discover/ analyze the CR event. With 2643 records ofdisease-associated CR events curated from 1172 original studies, dbCRID is a comprehensive and dynamic resource useful for studying DNA breakage and repair mechanisms, and for analyzing the genetic basis of human tumor and non-tumor diseases. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 24, "authors": [{"name": "Kong F."}, {"name": "Zhu J."}, {"name": "Wu J."}, {"name": "Peng J."}, {"name": "Wang Y."}, {"name": "Wang Q."}, {"name": "Fu S."}, {"name": "Yuan L.-L."}, {"name": "Li T."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "dbCRID Administrator", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "dbCRID@biolead.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dbcrid", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://c1.accurascience.com/dbCRID/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Indel detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0452"}, {"term": "Gene set testing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3224"}, {"term": "Named-entity and concept recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3280"}, {"term": "Genetic mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0282"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A database of Chromosomal Rearrangements In Diseases (dbCRID, http://dbCRID.biolead.org) is a database of human CR events and their associated diseases.
