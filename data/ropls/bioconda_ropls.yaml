description: Latent variable modeling with Principal Component Analysis(PCA) and Partial
  Least Squares (PLS) are powerful methods for visualization, regression, classification,
  and feature selection of omics data where the number of variables exceeds the number
  of samples and with multicollinearity among variables. Orthogonal Partial Least
  Squares (OPLS) enables to separately model the variation correlated (predictive)
  to the factor of interest and the uncorrelated (orthogonal) variation. While performing
  similarly to PLS, OPLS facilitates interpretation. Successful applications of these
  chemometrics techniques include spectroscopic data such as Raman spectroscopy, nuclear
  magnetic resonance (NMR), mass spectrometry (MS) in metabolomics and proteomics,
  but also transcriptomics data. In addition to scores, loadings and weights plots,
  the package provides metrics and graphics to determine the optimal number of components
  (e.g. with the R2 and Q2 coefficients), check the validity of the model by permutation
  testing, detect outliers, and perform feature selection (e.g. with Variable Importance
  in Projection or regression coefficients). The package can be accessed via a user
  interface on the Workflow4Metabolomics.org online resource for computational metabolomics
  (built upon the Galaxy environment).
