Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: Implementing and combining methods from a diverse range of R/Bioconductor packages into 'omics' data analysis workflows represents a significant challenge in terms of standardization, readability and reproducibility. Here, we present an R/Bioconductor package, named struct (Statistics in R using Class-based Templates), which defines a suite of class-based templates that allows users to develop and implement highly standardized and readable statistical analysis workflows. Struct integrates with the STATistics Ontology to ensure consistent reporting and maximizes semantic interoperability. We also present a toolbox, named structToolbox, which includes an extensive set of commonly used data analysis methods that have been implemented using struct. This toolbox can be used to build data-analysis workflows for metabolomics and other omics technologies.",
