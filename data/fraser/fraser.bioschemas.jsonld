      "sc:description": "Detection of aberrant splicing events in RNA-seq data with FRASER.\n\nFRASER is a tool to detect aberrant splicing events in RNA-seq data. The method is currently avaiable as preprint here.\n\nAccompanying analysis code for the FRASER manuscript.\n\nThe FRASER framework and workflow aims to assist the diagnostics in the field of rare diseases where RNA-seq is performed to identify aberrant splicing defects. For a short tutorial on how to use FRASER on a dataset please use our Colab tutorial at: http://tinyurl.com/RNA-ASHG-colab. This is based on a workshop we presented at ASHG 2019.\n\nFRASER: Find RAre Splicing Events in RNA-seq.\n\nThis folder contains the FRASER paper and supplementary data.\n\nThis project depends on the python package wBuild and the R package FRASER. Further, we use the Leafcutter adaptation used in the Kremer et al paper, which can be found here",
