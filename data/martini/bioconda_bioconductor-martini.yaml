about:
  description: martini deals with the low power inherent to GWAS studies by using
    prior knowledge represented as a network. SNPs are the vertices of the network,
    and the edges represent biological relationships between them (genomic adjacency,
    belonging to the same gene, physical interaction between protein products). The
    network is scanned using SConES, which looks for groups of SNPs maximally associated
    with the phenotype, that form a close subnetwork.
