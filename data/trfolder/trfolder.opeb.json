TRFolder is a command-line Python toolkit for TR-specific structure prediction. We developed a web-version built on the django web framework, leveraging the work done previously, to include enhancements to increase flexibility of usage. To date, there are five core sub-structures commonly found in TR of fungal species, which are the template region, downstream pseudoknot, boundary element, core-closing stem and triple helix. The aim of TRFolder-W is to use the five core structures as fundamental units to predict potential TR genes for yeast, and to provide a user-friendly interface. Moreover, the application of TRFolder-W can be extended to predict the characteristic structure on species other than fungal species. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press.

The common core structure found in all known TRs contains a pseudoknot and a triple helix, which are beyond the capability of existing RNA-structure-profiling techniques. We describe a novel approach to predict the structure of key TR features and to aid the identification of TRs in genomes, using a program we developed, TRFolder. We applied our method to confirm and improve previously studied core structures from Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces TRs. We made novel structural predictions of core elements of the TRs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Candida albicans, and several other yeast species. © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","authors":["Guo L.","Zhang D.","Wang Y.","Malmberg R.L.","McEachern M.J.","Cai L."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1504/IJBRA.2011.039170","journal":"International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications","title":"TRFolder: Computational prediction of novel telomerase RNA structures in yeast genomes","type":"Primary","year":"2011-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:trfolder","biotoolsID":"trfolder","description":"Telomerase RNA (TR) specific structure prediction.
