    "description": "An atom-based analysis and repository of 4M human protein-coding genetic variants.\n\nWelcome to the Missense3D suite of resources, developed by Professor Michael Sternberg's Group. The Missense3D portal hosts resources developed to characterise and prioritise missense variants (amino acid substitutions) using protein three-dimensional structural information from models or experimental coordinates.\n\nMissense3D predicts the structural changes introduced by an amino acid substitution. It is applicable for the analyse both experimental coordinates and predicted structures.\n\nMissense3D-DB is a database of precomputed structural predictions for ~4M human missense variants.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).The interpretation of human genetic variation is one of the greatest challenges of modern genetics. New approaches are urgently needed to prioritize variants, especially those that are rare or lack a definitive clinical interpretation. We examined 10,136,597 human missense genetic variants from GnomAD, ClinVar and UniProt. We were able to perform large-scale atom-based mapping and phenotype interpretation of 3,960,015 of these variants onto 18,874 experimental and 84,818 in house predicted three-dimensional coordinates of the human proteome. We demonstrate that 14% of amino acid substitutions from the GnomAD database that could be structurally analysed are predicted to affect protein structure (n = 568,548, of which 566,439 rare or extremely rare) and may, therefore, have a yet unknown disease-causing effect. The same is true for 19.0% (n = 6266) of variants of unknown clinical significance or conflicting interpretation reported in the ClinVar database. The results of the structural analysis are available in the dedicated web catalogue Missense3D-DB (http://missense3d.bc.ic.ac.uk/). For each of the 4 M variants, the results of the structural analysis are presented in a friendly concise format that can be included in clinical genetic reports. A detailed report of the structural analysis is also available for the non-experts in structural biology. Population frequency and predictions from SIFT and PolyPhen are included for a more comprehensive variant interpretation. This is the first large-scale atom-based structural interpretation of human genetic variation and offers geneticists and the biomedical community a new approach to genetic variant interpretation.",
