It offers functionalities such as free, grid and random point annotation. Annotations may be made following existing classification schemes for marine biota and substrata or with the use of user defined, customised lists of keywords, which broadens the range of potential application of the software to other types of studies (e.g. marine litter distribution assessment). If Internet access is available, PAPARA(ZZ)I can also query and use standardised taxa names directly from the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). Program outputs include abundances, densities and size calculations per keyword (e.g. per taxon). These results are written into text files that can be imported into spreadsheet programs for further analyses. PAPARA(ZZ)I is open-source and is available at http://papara-zz-i.github.io. Compiled versions exist for most 64-bit operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.",
