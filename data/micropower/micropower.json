Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com. Motivation: The variation in community composition between microbiome samples, termed beta diversity, can be measured by pairwise distance based on either presence-absence or quantitative species abundance data. PERMANOVA, a permutation-based extension of multivariate analysis of variance to a matrix of pairwise distances, partitions within-group and between-group distances to permit assessment of the effect of an exposure or intervention (grouping factor) upon the sampled microbiome. Within-group distance and exposure/intervention effect size must be accurately modeled to estimate statistical power for a microbiome study that will be analyzed with pairwise distances and PERMANOVA. Results: We present a framework for PERMANOVA power estimation tailored to marker-gene microbiome studies that will be analyzed by pairwise distances, which includes: (i) a novel method for distance matrix simulation that permits modeling of within-group pairwise distances according to pre-specified population parameters; (ii) a method to incorporate effects of different sizes within the simulated distance matrix; (iii) a simulation-based method for estimating PERMANOVA power from simulated distance matrices; and (iv) an R statistical software package that implements the above. Matrices of pairwise distances can be efficiently simulated to satisfy the triangle inequality and incorporate group-level effects, which are quantified by the adjusted coefficient of determination, omega-squared (x2). From simulated distance matrices, available PERMANOVA power or necessary sample size can be estimated for a planned microbiome study.", "citationCount": 60, "authors": [{"name": "Kelly B.J."}, {"name": "Gross R."}, {"name": "Bittinger K."}, {"name": "Sherrill-Mix S."}, {"name": "Lewis J.D."}, {"name": "Collman R.G."}, {"name": "Bushman F.D."}, {"name": "Li H."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Frederic Bushman", "url": "http://www.bushmanlab.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bushman@mail.med.upenn.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:micropower", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/brendankelly/micropower", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Species frequency estimation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3221"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Package designed to facilitate power estimation for microbiome studies that will be analyzed with pairwise distances (beta diversity) and PERMANOVA (a non-parametric extension of multivariate analysis of variance to a matrix of pairwise distances).", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/micropower-power-estimation-for-microbiome-studies.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "micropower", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:07:09Z", "name": "micropower", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/brendankelly/micropower/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
