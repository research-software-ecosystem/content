  "sc:description": "It finds trascription factor (TF) high accumulation DNA zones, i.e., regions along the genome where there is a high presence of different transcription factors. Starting from a dataset containing the genomic positions of TF binding regions, for each base of the selected chromosome the accumulation of TFs is computed. Two different methods for the search of TF high accumulation DNA zones, called \"binding regions\" and \"overlaps\", are available.",
