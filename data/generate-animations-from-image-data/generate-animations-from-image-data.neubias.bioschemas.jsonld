  "http://schema.org/description": "Imaris is a commercial 3D image visualisation and analysis tool. It can be used to produce complex 3D animations that include multiple volume and surface elements in several channels, as well as clipping planes and annotations such as text and arrows. Movies interpolate seamlessly between user-defined key frames, and properties such as viewing angle, zoom and visibility of each element can be changed during the animation. These features allow effective communication of results based on image data.",
