                "abstract": "Motivation: As an increasing number of protein structures become available, the need for algorithms that can quantify the similarity between protein structures increases as well. Thus, the comparison of proteins' structures, and their clustering accordingly to a given similarity measure, is at the core of today's biomedical research. In this paper, we show how an algorithmic information theory inspired Universal Similarity Metric (USM) can be used to calculate similarities between protein pairs. The method, besides being theoretically supported, is surprisingly simple to implement and computationally efficient. Results: Structural similarity between proteins in four different datasets was measured using the USM. The sample employed represented alpha, beta, alpha-beta, tim-barrel, globins and serpine protein types. The use of the proposed metric allows for a correct measurement of similarity and classification of the proteins in the four datasets. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",

                "abstract": "Protein structure comparison is a fundamental problem for structural genomics, with applications to drug design, fold prediction, protein clustering, and evolutionary studies. Despite its importance, there are very few rigorous methods and widely accepted similarity measures known for this problem. In this paper we describe the last few years of developments on the study of an emerging measure, the contact map overlap (CMO), for protein structure comparison. A contact map is a list of pairs of residues which lie in three-dimensional proximity in the protein's native fold. Although this measure is in principle computationally hard to optimize, we show how it can in fact be computed with great accuracy for related proteins by integer linear programming techniques. These methods have the advantage of providing certificates of near-optimality by means of upper bounds to the optimal alignment value. We also illustrate effective heuristics, such as local search and genetic algorithms. We were able to obtain for the first time optimal alignments for large similar proteins (about 1,000 residues and 2,000 contacts) and used the CMO measure to cluster proteins in families. The clusters obtained were compared to SCOP classification in order to validate the measure. Extensive computational experiments showed that alignments which are off by at most 10% from the optimal value can be computed in a short time. Further experiments showed how this measure reacts to the choice of the threshold defining a contact and how to choose this threshold in a sensible way.",

                "abstract": "Background: We introduce the decision support system for Protein (Structure) Comparison, Knowledge, Similarity and Information (ProCKSI). ProCKSI integrates various protein similarity measures through an easy to use interface that allows the comparison of multiple proteins simultaneously. It employs the Universal Similarity Metric (USM), the Maximum Contact Map Overlap (MaxCMO) of protein structures and other external methods such as the DaliLite and the TM-align methods, the Combinatorial Extension (CE) of the optimal path, and the FAST Align and Search Tool (FAST). Additionally, ProCKSI allows the user to upload a user-defined similarity matrix supplementing the methods mentioned, and computes a similarity consensus in order to provide a rich, integrated, multicriteria view of large datasets of protein structures. Results: We present ProCKSI's architecture and workflow describing its intuitive user interface, and show its potential on three distinct test-cases. In the first case, ProCKSI is used to evaluate the results of a previous CASP competition, assessing the similarity of proposed models for given targets where the structures could have a large deviation from one another. To perform this type of comparison reliably, we introduce a new consensus method. The second study deals with the verification of a classification scheme for protein kinases, originally derived by sequence comparison by Hanks and Hunter, but here we use a consensus similarity measure based on structures. In the third experiment using the Rost and Sander dataset (RS126), we investigate how a combination of different sets of similarity measures influences the quality and performance of ProCKSI's new consensus measure. ProCKSI performs well with all three datasets, showing its potential for complex, simultaneous multi-method assessment of structural similarity in large protein datasets. Furthermore, combining different similarity measures is usually more robust than relying on one single, unique measure. Conclusion: Based on a diverse set of similarity measures, ProCKSI computes a consensus similarity profile for the entire protein set. All results can be clustered, visualised, analysed and easily compared with each other through a simple and intuitive interface.
