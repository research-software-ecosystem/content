summary: flexible barcode and adapter removal for sequencing platforms
description: >
   Flexbar preprocesses high-throughput sequencing data efficiently. It
   demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter sequences. Moreover,
   trimming and filtering features are provided. Flexbar increases mapping
   rates and improves genome and transcriptome assemblies. It supports
   next-generation sequencing data in fasta/q and csfasta/q format from
   Illumina, Roche 454, and the SOLiD platform.
   .
   Parameter names changed in Flexbar. Please review scripts. The recent
   months, default settings were optimised, several bugs were fixed and
   various improvements were made, e.g. revamped command-line interface,
   new trimming modes as well as lower time and memory requirements.
version: 3.5.0
