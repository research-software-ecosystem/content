description: Flexbar preprocesses high-throughput sequencing data efficiently. It
  demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter sequences. Moreover, trimming and
  filtering features are provided. Flexbar increases mapping rates and improves genome
  and transcriptome assemblies. It supports next-generation sequencing data in fasta/q
  and csfasta/q format from Illumina, Roche 454, and the SOLiD platform. . Parameter
  names changed in Flexbar. Please review scripts. The recent months, default settings
  were optimised, several bugs were fixed and various improvements were made, e.g.
  revamped command-line interface, new trimming modes as well as lower time and memory
  requirements.
