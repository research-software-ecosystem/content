MERLot is an R package than can reconstruct complex lineage tree topologies using coordinates for cells in a given manifold(like diffusion maps) as input | A collection of scripts that was used to generate and benchmark the simulations provided with the tool MERLoT.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Advances in single-cell transcriptomics techniques are revolutionizing studies of cellular differentiation and heterogeneity. It has become possible to track the trajectory of thousands of genes across the cellular lineage trees that represent the temporal emergence of cell types during dynamic processes. However, reconstruction of cellular lineage trees with more than a few cell fates has proved challenging. We present MERLoT (https://github.com/soedinglab/merlot), a flexible and user-friendly tool to reconstruct complex lineage trees from single-cell transcriptomics data. It can impute temporal gene expression profiles along the reconstructed tree. We show MERLoT's capabilities on various real cases and hundreds of simulated datasets.",
