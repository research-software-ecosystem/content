Published by Oxford University Press.ConoMode is a database for complex three-dimensional (3D) structures of conopeptides binding with their target proteins. Conopeptides, a large family of peptides from the venom of marine snails of the Conus genus, have exceptionally diverse sequences, and their high specificity to block ion channels makes them crucial as drug leads and tools for physiological studies. ConoMode is a specialized archive for the collection of 3D coordinate data for the conopeptides and their binding target proteins from published literature and the Protein Data Bank. These 3D structures can be determined using experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy and computational methods including docking, homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding modes for the conopeptides determined using computational modeling must be validated based on experimental data. The 3D coordinate data from ConoMode can be searched, visualized, downloaded and uploaded. Currently, ConoMode manages 19 conopeptide sequences (from 10 Conus species), 15 protein sequences and 37 3D structures. ConoMode utilizes a modern technical framework to provide a good user experience on mobile devices with touch interaction features. Furthermore, the database is fully optimized for unstructured data and flexible data models. Database URL: http://conomode.qnlm.ac/conomode/conomode/index.",
