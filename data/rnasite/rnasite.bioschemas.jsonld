      "sc:description": "Recognition of small molecule-RNA binding sites using RNA sequence and structure.\n\nRNA-ligand binding sites prediction.\n\nRNAsite is a novel method to predict small molecule-RNA binding sites. We first developed a structure-based method (RNAsite_str) by designing a group of novel structure-based features that effectively captured the perferences towards small molecule-RNA binding sites. Second, a sequence profile-based predictor (RNAsite_seq) was designed to deal with the cases where no structure is available. These two methods are combined, yielding to the final approach RNAsite.
