While the standard methods for CNA detection (CGH arrays, SNP arrrays, DNA sequencing) rely on DNA, occasionally DNA data are not available, especially in cancer studies (e.g. biopsies, legacy data). CNAPE comes into play by predicting CNAs based on gene expression data from RNA-seq",

Widely used methods, such as DNA arrays and genomic DNA sequencing, are relatively expensive and require DNA samples at a microgram level, which are not avaiblable in certain situations like clinical biopsies or single-cell genomes. Here, we developed an alternative method - CNAPE to computationally infer copy number alterations from gene expression data. A prior knowledge-aided machine learning model was proposed, trained and tested on 9,740 cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We then applied CNAPE to study gliomas, the most common and aggressive brain cancer in adult. Particularly, using RNA sequencing data, CNAPE respectively predicted DNA copy number of chromosomes, chromosomal arms, and 12 commonly altered genes, and achieved over 80 percent accuracy in almost all broad regions and some focal regions. CNAPE was developed as an easy-to-use tool at https://github.com/WangLabHKUST/CNAPE.",
