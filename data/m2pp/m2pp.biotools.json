                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Detecting pathogenic proteins is the origin way to understand the mechanism and resist the invasion of diseases, making pathogenic protein prediction develop into an urgent problem to be solved. Prediction for genome-wide proteins may be not necessarily conducive to rapidly cure diseases as developing new drugs specifically for the predicted pathogenic protein always need major expenditures on time and cost. In order to facilitate disease treatment, computational method to predict pathogenic proteins which are targeted by existing drugs should be exploited. Results: In this study, we proposed a novel computational model to predict drug-targeted pathogenic proteins, named as M2PP. Three types of features were presented on our constructed heterogeneous network (including target proteins, diseases and drugs), which were based on the neighborhood similarity information, drug-inferred information and path information. Then, a random forest regression model was trained to score unconfirmed target-disease pairs. Five-fold cross-validation experiment was implemented to evaluate model’s prediction performance, where M2PP achieved advantageous results compared with other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, M2PP accurately predicted high ranked pathogenic proteins for common diseases with public biomedical literature as supporting evidence, indicating its excellent ability. Conclusions: M2PP is an effective and accurate model to predict drug-targeted pathogenic proteins, which could provide convenience for the future biological researches.",
