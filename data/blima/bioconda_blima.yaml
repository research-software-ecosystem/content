biotools_id: blima
description: Package blima includes several algorithms for the preprocessing of Illumina
  microarray data. It focuses to the bead level analysis and provides novel approach
  to the quantile normalization of the vectors of unequal lengths. It provides variety
  of the methods for background correction including background subtraction, RMA like
  convolution and background outlier removal. It also implements variance stabilizing
  transformation on the bead level. There are also implemented methods for data summarization.
  It also provides the methods for performing T-tests on the detector (bead) level
  and on the probe level for differential expression testing.
