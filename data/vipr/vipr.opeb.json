The NIAID-sponsored Virus Pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR, www.viprbrc.org) supports bioinformatics workflows for a broad range of human virus pathogens and other related viruses, including the entire Coronaviridae family. ViPR provides access to sequence records, gene and protein annotations, immune epitopes, 3D structures, host factor data, and other data types through an intuitive web-based search interface. Records returned from these queries can then be subjected to web-based analyses including: multiple sequence alignment, phylogenetic inference, sequence variation determination, BLAST comparison, and metadata-driven comparative genomics statistical analysis. Additional tools exist to display multiple sequence alignments, view phylogenetic trees, visualize 3D protein structures, transfer existing reference genome annotations to new genomes, and store or share results from any search or analysis within personal private 'Workbench' spaces for future access. All of the data and integrated analysis and visualization tools in ViPR are made available without charge as a service to the Coronaviridae research community to facilitate the research and development of diagnostics, prophylactics, vaccines and therapeutics against these human pathogens. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","authors":["Pickett B.E.","Greer D.S.","Zhang Y.","Stewart L.","Zhou L.","Sun G.","Gu Z.","Kumar S.","Zaremba S.","Larsen C.N.","Jen W.","Klem E.B.","Scheuermann R.H."],"cit_count":34,"journal":"Viruses","pmid":"23202522","title":"Virus pathogen Database and Analysis Resource (ViPR): A comprehensive bioinformatics Database and Analysis Resource for the Coronavirus research community","type":"Other","year":"2012-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vipr","biotoolsID":"vipr","description":"This database supports the research of viral pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogen lists and those causing (re)emerging infectious diseases.
