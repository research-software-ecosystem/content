This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The recent FDA approval of the MiSeqDx platform provides a unique opportunity to develop targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) panels for human disease, including cancer. We have developed a scalable, targeted panel-based assay termed UNCseq, which involves a NGS panel of over 200 cancer-associated genes and a standardized downstream bioinformatics pipeline for detection of single nucleotide variations (SNV) as well as small insertions and deletions (indel). In addition, we developed a novel algorithm, NGScopy, designed for samples with sparse sequencing coverage to detect large-scale copy number variations (CNV), similar to human SNP Array 6.0 as well as small-scale intragenic CNV. Overall, we applied this assay to 100 snap-frozen lung cancer specimens lacking same-patient germline DNA (07-0120 tissue cohort) and validated our results against Sanger sequencing, SNP Array, and our recently published integrated DNA-seq/RNA-seq assay, UNCqeR, where RNA-seq of same-patient tumor specimens confirmed SNV detected by DNA-seq, if RNA-seq coverage depth was adequate. In addition, we applied the UNCseq assay on an independent lung cancer tumor tissue collection with available same-patient germline DNA (11-1115 tissue cohort) and confirmed mutations using assays performed in a CLIA-certified laboratory. We conclude that UNCseq can identify SNV, indel, and CNV in tumor specimens lacking germline DNA in a cost-efficient fashion.", "citationCount": 16, "authors": [{"name": "Zhao X."}, {"name": "Wang A."}, {"name": "Walter V."}, {"name": "Patel N.M."}, {"name": "Eberhard D.A."}, {"name": "Hayward M.C."}, {"name": "Salazar A.H."}, {"name": "Jo H."}, {"name": "Soloway M.G."}, {"name": "Wilkerson M.D."}, {"name": "Parker J.S."}, {"name": "Yin X."}, {"name": "Zhang G."}, {"name": "Siegel M.B."}, {"name": "Rosson G.B."}, {"name": "Earp H.S."}, {"name": "Sharpless N.E."}, {"name": "Gulley M.L."}, {"name": "Weck K.E."}, {"name": "Hayes D.N."}, {"name": "Moschos S.J."}], "date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Xiaobei Zhao", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "xiaobei@binf.ku.dk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ngscopy", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.8.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/NGScopy.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Copy number estimation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3233"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Provides a quantitative caller for detecting copy number variations in next generation sequencing (NGS), including whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WES) and targeted panel sequencing (TPS).
