Created as a means for communicating biomolecule structures to a diverse scientific audience, Proteopedia (http://www.proteopedia.org) presents structural annotation in an intuitive, interactive format and allows members of the scientific community to easily contribute their own annotations. Here, we provide a status report on Proteopedia by describing advances in the web resource since its inception three and a half years ago, focusing on features of potential direct use to the scientific community. We discuss its progress as a collaborative 3D-encyclopedia of structures as well as its use as a complement to scientific publications and PowerPoint presentations. We also describe Proteopedia's use for 3D visualization in structure-related pedagogy. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "citationCount": 31, "authors": [{"name": "Prilusky J."}, {"name": "Hodis E."}, {"name": "Canner D."}, {"name": "Decatur W.A."}, {"name": "Oberholser K."}, {"name": "Martz E."}, {"name": "Berchanski A."}, {"name": "Harel M."}, {"name": "Sussman J.L."}], "date": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Structural Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "Instruct", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ccisb@stfc.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:proteopedia", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.proteopedia.org", "function": [{"note": "Proteopedia is an interactive encyclopedia of proteins, RNA, DNA and other molecules.
