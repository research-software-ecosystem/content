description: 'Designed to call insertions of any size, whether they are novel or duplicated,
  homozygous or heterozygous in the donor genome. It takes as input a set of reads
  and a reference genome. It outputs two sets of FASTA sequences: one is the set of
  breakpoints of detection insertion sites, the other is the set of assembled insertions
  for each breakpoint. MindTheGap can also be used as a genome assembly finishing
  tool. It can fill the gaps between a set of input contigs without any a priori on
  their relative order and orientation. It outputs the results in gfa file.'
