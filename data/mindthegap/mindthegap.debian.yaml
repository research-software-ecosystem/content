description: "Designed to call insertions of any size, whether they are novel or duplicated,\
  \ homozygous or heterozygous in the donor genome. It takes as input a set of reads\
  \ and a reference genome. It outputs two sets of FASTA sequences: one is the set\
  \ of breakpoints of detection insertion sites, the other is the set of assembled\
  \ insertions for each breakpoint. MindTheGap can also be used as a genome assembly\
  \ finishing tool. It can fill the gaps between a set of input contigs without any\
  \ a priori on their relative order and orientation. It outputs the results in gfa\
  \ file.\n"
