Published by Oxford University Press. MOTIVATION: Many bioinformatics areas require us to assign domain matches onto stretches of a query protein. Starting with a set of candidate matches, we want to identify the optimal subset that has limited/no overlap between matches. This may be further complicated by discontinuous domains in the input data. Existing tools are increasingly facing very large data-sets for which they require prohibitive amounts of CPU-time and memory. RESULTS: We present cath-resolve-hits (CRH), a new tool that uses a dynamic-programming algorithm implemented in open-source C++ to handle large datasets quickly (up to ∼1 million hits/second) and in reasonable amounts of memory. It accepts multiple input formats and provides its output in plain text, JSON or graphical HTML. We describe a benchmark against an existing algorithm, which shows CRH delivers very similar or slightly improved results and very much improved CPU/memory performance on large datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: CRH is available at https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-tools; documentation is available at http://cath-tools.readthedocs.io. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","authors":["Lewis T.E.","Sillitoe I.","Lees J.G."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty863","journal":"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","title":"cath-resolve-hits: a new tool that resolves domain matches suspiciously quickly","type":"Primary","year":"2019-05-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CRH","biotoolsID":"CRH","description":"cath-resolve-hits (CRH)- tool that resolves domain matches suspiciously quickly.","homepage":"https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-tools","name":"CRH"}}
