Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short sequences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70%. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel organisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys. \u00a9 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 1266, "authors": [{"name": "Haas B.J."}, {"name": "Gevers D."}, {"name": "Earl A.M."}, {"name": "Feldgarden M."}, {"name": "Ward D.V."}, {"name": "Giannoukos G."}, {"name": "Ciulla D."}, {"name": "Tabbaa D."}, {"name": "Highlander S.K."}, {"name": "Sodergren E."}, {"name": "Methe B."}, {"name": "DeSantis T.Z."}, {"name": "Petrosino J.F."}, {"name": "Knight R."}, {"name": "Birren B.W."}], "date": "2011-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.broadinstitute.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:chimeraslayer", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["20101212"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net/#A_CS", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Chimeric sequence detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0450"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Query", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A chimeric sequence detection utility, compatible with near-full length Sanger sequences and shorter 454-FLX sequences.
