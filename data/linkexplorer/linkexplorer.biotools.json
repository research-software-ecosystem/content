However, many current algorithms are black boxes or lack good user interfaces that could facilitate insight into why predictions are made. We present LinkExplorer, a software suite for predicting, explaining and exploring links in large biomedical knowledge graphs. LinkExplorer integrates our novel, rule-based link prediction engine SAFRAN, which was recently shown to outcompete other explainable algorithms and established black-box algorithms. Here, we demonstrate highly competitive evaluation results of our algorithm on multiple large biomedical knowledge graphs, and release a web interface that allows for interactive and intuitive exploration of predicted links and their explanations.",
