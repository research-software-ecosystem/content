This heterogeneity is a major confounder in standard analysis such as differential expression analysis, where differences in the relative proportions of the constituent cells may prevent or bias the detection of cell-specific differences. Computational deconvolution of global gene expression is an appealing alternative to costly physical sample separation techniques and enables a more detailed analysis of the underlying biological processes at the cell-type level. To facilitate and popularize the application of such methods, we developed CellMix, an R package that incorporates most state-of-the-art deconvolution methods, into an intuitive and extendible framework, providing a single entry point to explore, assess and disentangle gene expression data from heterogeneous samples. Availability and Implementation: The CellMix package builds on R/BioConductor and is available from http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/ \u223crenaud/CRAN/web/CellMix. It is currently being submitted to BioConductor. The package's vignettes notably contain additional information, examples and references. \u00a9 2013 The Author.", "citationCount": 88, "authors": [{"name": "Gaujoux R."}, {"name": "Seoighe C."}], "date": "2013-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cellmix", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.6.2"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~renaud/CRAN/web/CellMix/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Deconvolution", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "CellMix , an R package that incorporates most state-of-the-art deconvolution methods, into an intuitive and extendible framework, providing a single entry point to explore, assess and disentangle gene expression data from heterogeneous samples.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/cellmix-1-6-1-gene-expression-deconvolution.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "cellmix", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:05:05Z", "name": "CellMix", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/~renaud/CRAN/web/CellMix/_MAN.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
