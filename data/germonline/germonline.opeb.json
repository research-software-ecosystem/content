It is thus a source of information for life scientists as well as clinicians who are interested in gene expression and regulatory networks. The GermOnline gateway provides unlimited access to information produced with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (3'-UTR GeneChips), genome-wide protein-DNA binding assays and protein-protein interaction studies in the context of Ensembl genome annotation. Samples used to produce high-throughput expression data and to carry out genome-wide in vivo DNA binding assays are annotated via the MIAME-compliant Multiomics Information Management and Annotation System (MIMAS 3.0). Furthermore, the Saccharomyces Genomics Viewer (SGV) was developed and integrated into the gateway. SGV is a visualization tool that outputs genome annotation and DNA-strand specific expression data produced with high-density oligonucleotide tiling microarrays (Sc_tlg GeneChips) which cover the complete budding yeast genome on both DNA strands. It facilitates the interpretation of expression levels and transcript structures determined for various cell types cultured under different growth and differentiation conditions.
