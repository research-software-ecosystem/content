biotools_id: segmentseq
description: High-throughput sequencing technologies allow the production of large
  volumes of short sequences, which can be aligned to the genome to create a set of
  matches to the genome. By looking for regions of the genome which to which there
  are high densities of matches, we can infer a segmentation of the genome into regions
  of biological significance. The methods in this package allow the simultaneous segmentation
  of data from multiple samples, taking into account replicate data, in order to create
  a consensus segmentation. This has obvious applications in a number of classes of
  sequencing experiments, particularly in the discovery of small RNA loci and novel
  mRNA transcriptome discovery.
