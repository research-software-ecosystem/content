    "description": "This package allows the simultaneous segmentation of data from multiple samples, taking into account replicate data, in order to create a consensus segmentation. This has obvious applications in a number of classes of sequencing experiments, particularly in the discovery of small RNA loci and novel mRNA transcriptome discovery.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are produced from much longer sequences of double-stranded RNA precursors through cleavage by Dicer or a Dicer-like protein. These small RNAs play a key role in genetic and epigenetic regulation; however, a full understanding of the mechanisms by which they operate depends on the characterization of the precursors from which they are derived.Results: High-throughput sequencing of small RNA populations allows the locations of the double-stranded RNA precursors to be inferred. We have developed methods to analyse small RNA sequencing data from multiple biological sources, taking into account replicate information, to identify robust sets of siRNA precursors. Our methods show good performance on both a set of small RNA sequencing data in Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated datasets. \u00a9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.
