                "abstract": "This article describes a method developed for predicting transmembrane \u03b2-barrel regions in membrane proteins using machine learning techniques: artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). The ANN used in this study is a feed-forward neural network with a standard back-propagation training algorithm. The accuracy of the ANN-based method improved significantly, from 70.4% to 80.5%, when evolutionary information was added to a single sequence as a multiple sequence alignment obtained from PSI-BLAST. We have also developed an SVM-based method using a primary sequence as input and achieved an accuracy of 77.4%. The SVM model was modified by adding 36 physicochemical parameters to the amino acid sequence information. Finally, ANN- and SVM-based methods were combined to utilize the full potential of both techniques. The accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of SVM, ANN, and combined method are 78.5%, 80.5%, and 81.8%, and 0.55, 0.63, and 0.64, respectively. These methods were trained and tested on a nonredundant data set of 16 proteins, and performance was evaluated using \"leave one out cross-validation\" (LOOCV). Based on this study, we have developed a Web server, TBBPred, for predicting transmembrane \u03b2-barrel regions in proteins (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbbpred). \u00a9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",
