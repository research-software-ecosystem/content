The ANN used in this study is a feed-forward neural network with a standard back-propagation training algorithm. The accuracy of the ANN-based method improved significantly, from 70.4% to 80.5%, when evolutionary information was added to a single sequence as a multiple sequence alignment obtained from PSI-BLAST. We have also developed an SVM-based method using a primary sequence as input and achieved an accuracy of 77.4%. The SVM model was modified by adding 36 physicochemical parameters to the amino acid sequence information. Finally, ANN- and SVM-based methods were combined to utilize the full potential of both techniques. The accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value of SVM, ANN, and combined method are 78.5%, 80.5%, and 81.8%, and 0.55, 0.63, and 0.64, respectively. These methods were trained and tested on a nonredundant data set of 16 proteins, and performance was evaluated using \"leave one out cross-validation\" (LOOCV). Based on this study, we have developed a Web server, TBBPred, for predicting transmembrane \u03b2-barrel regions in proteins (available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbbpred). \u00a9 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 84, "authors": [{"name": "Natt N.K."}, {"name": "Kaur H."}, {"name": "Raghava G.P.S."}], "date": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr G.P.S.Raghava", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "raghava@imtech.res.in"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ms. Navjyot Kaur", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "navjot@imtech.res.in"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tbbpred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/tbbpred/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Multiple sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0492"}, {"term": "Transmembrane protein visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2241"}, {"term": "Transmembrane protein analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0270"}, {"term": "Transmembrane protein prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0269"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predicts the transmembrane Beta barrel regions in a given protein sequence.
