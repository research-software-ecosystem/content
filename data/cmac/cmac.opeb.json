Unfortunately, commercial methods for myoelectric control, although robust and simple, are unintuitive and cognitively taxing when applied to an advanced multifunctional prosthesis. The state-of-the-art methods developed in academia are based on machine learning and therefore require long training and suffer from a lack of robustness. This work presents a novel closed-loop multi-level amplitude controller (CMAC), which aims at overcoming these drawbacks. The CMAC implements three degrees-of-freedom (DoF) control by thresholding the muscle contraction intensity during wrist flexion and extension movements.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31841418","name":"CMAC"}}
