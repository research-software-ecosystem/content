Multiple testing issues due to the thousands of tests run make some of the more popular methods for doing this problematic. Results: We propose a simple method, Normal Uniform Differential Gene Expression (NUDGE) detection for finding differentially expressed genes in cDNA microarrays. The method uses a simple univariate normal-uniform mixture model, in combination with new normalization methods for spread as well as mean that extend the lowess normalization of Dudoit, Yang, Callow and Speed (2002) [1]. It takes account of multiple testing, and gives probabilities of differential expression as part of its output. It can be applied to either single-slide or replicated experiments, and it is very fast. Three datasets are analyzed using NUDGE, and the results are compared to those given by other popular methods: unadjusted and Bonferroni-adjusted t tests, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), and Empirical Bayes for microarrays (EBarrays) with both Gamma-Gamma and Lognormal-Normal models. Conclusion: The method gives a high probability of differential expression to genes known/suspected a priori to be differentially expressed and a low probability to the others. In terms of known false positives and false negatives, the method outperforms all multiple-replicate methods except for the Gamma-Gamma EBarrays method to which it offers comparable results with the added advantages of greater simplicity, speed, fewer assumptions and applicability to the single replicate case. An R package called nudge to implement the methods in this paper will be made available soon at http://www.bioconductor.org. © 2005 Dean and Raftery; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Dean N.","Raftery A.E."],"cit_count":45,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-6-173","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"Normal uniform mixture differential gene expression detection for cDNA microarrays","type":"Primary","year":"2005-07-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nudge","biotoolsID":"nudge","description":"Package for normalizing microarray data in single and multiple replicate experiments and fitting a normal-uniform mixture to detect differentially expressed genes in the cases where the two samples are being compared directly or indirectly (via a common reference sample).","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/nudge.html","name":"nudge","version":["1.40.0"]}}
