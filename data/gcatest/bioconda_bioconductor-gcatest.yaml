about:
  description: GCAT is an association test for genome wide association studies that
    controls for population structure under a general class of trait models.  This
    test conditions on the trait, which makes it immune to confounding by unmodeled
    environmental factors.  Population structure is modeled via logistic factors,
    which are estimated using the `lfa` package.
