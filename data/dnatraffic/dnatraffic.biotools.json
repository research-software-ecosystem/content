                "abstract": "DNAtraffic (http://dnatraffic.ibb.waw.pl/) is dedicated to be a unique comprehensive and richly annotated database of genome dynamics during the cell life. It contains extensive data on the nomenclature, ontology, structure and function of proteins related to the DNA integrity mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, DNA repair and damage response from eight organisms: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana. DNAtraffic contains comprehensive information on the diseases related to the assembled human proteins. DNAtraffic is richly annotated in the systemic information on the nomenclature, chemistry and structure of DNA damage and their sources, including environmental agents or commonly used drugs targeting nucleic acids and/or proteins involved in the maintenance of genome stability. One of the DNAtraffic database aim is to create the first platform of the combinatorial complexity of DNA network analysis. Database includes illustrations of pathways, damage, proteins and drugs. Since DNAtraffic is designed to cover a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines, it has to be extensively linked to numerous external data sources. Our database represents the result of the manual annotation work aimed at making the DNAtraffic much more useful for a wide range of systems biology applications. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.
