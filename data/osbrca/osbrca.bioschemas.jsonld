However, it is technically challenging for untrained researchers to process high dimensional profiling data to screen and validate the potential prognostic values of genes of interests in multiple cohorts. Our aim is to develop an easy-to-use web server to facilitate the screening, developing, and evaluating of prognostic biomarkers in breast cancers",
