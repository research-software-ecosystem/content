There is currently a lack of tools that would automatically estimate the best k to use and/or quickly generate histograms of k-mer abundances that would allow the user to make an informed decision.Results: We develop a fast and accurate sampling method that constructs approximate abundance histograms with several orders of magnitude performance improvement over traditional methods. We then present a fast heuristic that uses the generated abundance histograms for putative k values to estimate the best possible value of k. We test the effectiveness of our tool using diverse sequencing datasets and find that its choice of k leads to some of the best assemblies.Availability: Our tool KmerGenie is freely available at: http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu/.Contact: \u00a9 2013 The Author 2013.", "citationCount": 196, "authors": [{"name": "Chikhi R."}, {"name": "Medvedev P."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "KmerGenie Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kmergenie@cse.psu.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:kmergenie", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "KmerGenie estimates the best k-mer length for genome de novo assembly. Given a set of reads, KmerGenie first computes the k-mer abundance histogram for many values of k. Then, for each value of k, it predicts the number of distinct genomic k-mers in the dataset, and returns the k-mer length which maximizes this number. Experiments show that KmerGenie's choices lead to assemblies that are close to the best possible over all k-mer lengths.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "C++", "Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "kmergenie", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:15:11Z", "name": "KmerGenie", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://kmergenie.bx.psu.edu/README", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
