The automated assignment of NOESY cross peaks has become a fundamental technique for NMR protein structure analysis. A widely used algorithm for this purpose is implemented in the program CYANA. It has been used for a large number of structure determinations of proteins in solution but was so far not described in full detail. In this paper we present a complete description of the CYANA implementation of automated NOESY assignment, which differs extensively from its predecessor CANDID by the use of a consistent probabilistic treatment, and we discuss its performance in the second round of the critical assessment of structure determination by NMR.", "citationCount": 77, "authors": [{"name": "Guntert P."}, {"name": "Buchner L."}], "date": "2015-08-22T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Biomolecular NMR"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "Instruct", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ccisb@stfc.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cyana", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cyana.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page", "function": [{"note": "Combined assignment and dynamics algorithm for NMR applications CYANA is a program for automated structure calculation of biological macromolecules on the basis of conformational constraints from NMR.
