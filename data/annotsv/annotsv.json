Summary Structural Variations (SV) are a major source of variability in the human genome that shaped its actual structure during evolution. Moreover, many human diseases are caused by SV, highlighting the need to accurately detect those genomic events but also to annotate them and assist their biological interpretation. Therefore, we developed AnnotSV that compiles functionally, regulatory and clinically relevant information and aims at providing annotations useful to (i) interpret SV potential pathogenicity and (ii) filter out SV potential false positive. In particular, AnnotSV reports heterozygous and homozygous counts of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions called within each SV for the analyzed patients, this genomic information being extremely useful to support or question the existence of an SV. We also report the computed allelic frequency relative to overlapping variants from DGV (MacDonald et al., 2014), that is especially powerful to filter out common SV. To delineate the strength of AnnotSV, we annotated the 4751 SV from one sample of the 1000 Genomes Project, integrating the sample information of four million of SNV/indel, in less than 60 s. Availability and implementation AnnotSV is implemented in Tcl and runs in command line on all platforms. The source code is available under the GNU GPL license.
