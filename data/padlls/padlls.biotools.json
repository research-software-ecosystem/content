                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Multiple studies have created state-of-the-art liver segmentation models using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) such as the V-net and H-DenseUnet. Oversegmentation however continues to be a problem. We set forth to address these limitations by developing a an automated workflow that leverages the strengths of different DCNN architectures, resulting in a pipeline that enables fully automated liver segmentation. A Pipeline for Automated Deep Learning Liver Segmentation (PADLLS) was developed and implemented that cascades multiple DCNNs that were trained on more than 200 CT scans. First, a V-net is used to create a rough liver, spleen, and stomach mask. After stomach and spleen pixels are removed using their respective masks and ascites is removed using a morphological algorithm, the scan is passed to a H-DenseUnet to yield the final segmentation. The segmentation accuracy of the pipleline was compared to the H-DenseUnet and the V-net using the SLIVER07 and 3DIRCADb datasets as benchmarks. The PADLLS Dice score for the SLIVER07 dataset was calculated to be 0.957 ± 0.033 and was significantly better than the H-DenseUnet’s score of 0.927 ± 0.044 (p = 0.0219) and the V-net’s score of 0.872 ± 0.121 (p = 0.0067). The PADLLS Dice score for the 3DIRCADb dataset was 0.965 ± 0.016 and was significantly better than the H-DenseUnet’s score of 0.930 ± 0.041 (p = 0.0014) the V-net’s score of 0.874 ± 0.060 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, our pipeline (PADLLS) outperforms existing liver segmentation models, serves as a valuable tool for image-based analysis, and is freely available for download and use.",
