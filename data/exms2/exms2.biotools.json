                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 American Chemical Society.Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX MS) has become an important technique for the analysis of protein structure and dynamics. Data analysis remains a bottleneck in the workflow. Sophisticated computer analysis is required to scan through the voluminous MS output in order to find, identify, and validate many partially deuterated peptides, elicit the HDX information, and extend the results to higher structural resolution. We previously made available two software suites, ExMS for identification and analysis of peptide isotopic envelopes in the HDX MS raw data and HDsite for residue-level resolution. Further experience has led to advances in the usability and performance of both programs. Also, newly added modules deal with ETD/ECD analysis, multimodal mass spectra analysis, and presentation options. These advances have been integrated into a stand-alone software solution named ExMS2. The package has been successfully tested by many workers in fine scale epitope mapping, in protein folding studies, and in dissecting structure and structure change of large protein complexes. A description and tutorial for this major upgrade are given here.",
