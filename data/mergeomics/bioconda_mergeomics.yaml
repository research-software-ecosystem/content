description: The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for integrating
  multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional genomics, canonical pathways
  and gene-gene interaction networks to generate mechanistic hypotheses. It includes
  two main parts, 1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA); 2) Weighted Key Driver
  Analysis (wKDA).
