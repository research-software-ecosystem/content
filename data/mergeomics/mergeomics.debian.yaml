description: "The Mergeomics pipeline serves as a flexible framework for integrating\
  \ multidimensional omics-disease associations, functional genomics, canonical pathways\
  \ and gene-gene interaction networks to generate mechanistic hypotheses. It includes\
  \ two main parts: 1) Marker set enrichment analysis (MSEA); 2) Weighted Key Driver\
  \ Analysis (wKDA).\n"
