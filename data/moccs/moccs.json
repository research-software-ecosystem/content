A single TF can accept ambiguity within its DNA-binding motifs, which comprise both canonical (typical) and non-canonical motifs. Clarification of such DNA-binding motif ambiguity is crucial for revealing gene regulatory networks and evaluating mutations in cis-regulatory elements. Although chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) now provides abundant data on the genomic sequences to which a given TF binds, existing motif discovery methods are unable to directly answer whether a given TF can bind to a specific DNA-binding motif. Results Here, we report a method for clarifying the DNA-binding motif ambiguity, MOCCS. Given ChIP-Seq data of any TF, MOCCS comprehensively analyzes and describes every k-mer to which that TF binds. Analysis of simulated datasets revealed that MOCCS is applicable to various ChIP-Seq datasets, requiring only a few minutes per dataset. Application to the ENCODE ChIP-Seq datasets proved that MOCCS directly evaluates whether a given TF binds to each DNA-binding motif, even if known position weight matrix models do not provide sufficient information on DNA-binding motif ambiguity. Furthermore, users are not required to provide numerous parameters or background genomic sequence models that are typically unavailable. MOCCS is implemented in Perl and R and is freely available via https://github.com/yuifu/moccs. Conclusions By complementing existing motif-discovery software, MOCCS will contribute to the basic understanding of how the genome controls diverse cellular processes via DNA\u2013protein interactions.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Ozaki H."}, {"name": "Iwasaki W."}], "date": "2016-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Computational Biology and Chemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Haruka Ozaki", "url": "http://yuifu.github.io/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "harukao.cb@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:moccs", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/yuifu/moccs", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Differential binding analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3677"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Method for for clarifying DNA-binding motif ambiguity.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/moccs-motif-centrality-analysis-of-chip-seq.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "moccs", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:49:51Z", "name": "MOCCS", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/yuifu/moccs/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
