  "sc:description": "A probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA, codon and amino-acid sequences. It’s based on a novel algorithm that treats insertions correctly and avoids over-estimation of the number of deletion events. In addition, PRANK borrows ideas from maximum likelihood methods used in phylogenetics and correctly takes into account the evolutionary distances between sequences.",
