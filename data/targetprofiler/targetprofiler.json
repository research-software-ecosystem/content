Here, we introduce a novel miRNA target prediction tool called Targetprofiler that utilizes a probabilistic learning algorithm in the form of a hidden Markov model trained on experimentally verified miRNA targets. Using a large scale protein downregulation data set we validate our method and compare its performance to existing tools. We find that Targetprofiler exhibits greater correlation between computational predictions and protein downregulation and predicts experimentally verified miRNA targets more accurately than three other tools. Concurrently, we use primer extension to identify the mature sequence of a novel miRNA gene recently identified within a cancer associated genomic region and use Targetprofiler to predict its potential targets. Experimental verification of the ability of this small RNA molecule to regulate the expression of CC ND2, a gene with documented oncogenic activity, confirms its functional role as a miRNA. These findings highlight the competitive advantage of our tool and its efficacy in extracting biologically significant results. \u00a9 2012 Landes Bioscience.", "citationCount": 13, "authors": [{"name": "Oulas A."}, {"name": "Karathanasis N."}, {"name": "Louloupi A."}, {"name": "Iliopoulos I."}, {"name": "Kalantidis K."}, {"name": "Poirazi P."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "RNA Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://sites.google.com/site/cbgiliopoulos/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "poirazi@dendrites.gr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:targetprofiler", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mirna.imbb.forth.gr/Targetprofiler.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "miRNA expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3792"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A novel miRNA target prediction tool that utilizes a probabilistic learning algorithm in the form of a hidden Markov model trained on experimentally verified miRNA targets.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/targetprofiler-mirna-target-prediction-tool.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "targetprofiler", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:03:08Z", "name": "TargetProfiler", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://mirna.imbb.forth.gr/Targetprofiler.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
