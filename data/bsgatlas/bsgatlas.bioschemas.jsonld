      "sc:description": "An enhanced annotation of genes and transcripts for the Bacillus subtilis genome with improved information access.\n\nOn this website we provide access to our annotation integration efforts for Bacillus subtilis 168. We integrated the gene annotations from BsubCyc, Rfam, RefSeq, SubtiWiki, and some additional resources (see manuscript for details). Each gene indicates from which reources its annotation stem from, and links to the respective resources are provided where applicable. The integration overall improved the annotation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) in B. subtilis. Based on public transcription start sites (TSS) and termination sites (TTS), we created a comprehensive annotation of operons, transcripts, and transcriptional units (TU) for 93% of the genes in the genome. We provide the BSGatlas in form of a UCSC browser hub, a downloadable GFF3 file, and as a light-weight interactive quick browser directly on this side",
