description: The package includes methods for variable modeling as pca or pls, that
  can be useful for visualization, regression, classification, and feature selection
  of omics data where the number of variables exceeds the number of samples and with
  multicollinearity among variables. orthogonal partial least squares (opls) also
  enables to separately model the variation correlated (predictive) to the factor
  of interest and the uncorrelated (orthogonal) variation.
