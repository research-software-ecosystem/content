In this paper we present a domain-independent method for the automatic extraction of multi-word terms, from machine-readable special language corpora. The method, (C-value/NC-value), combines linguistic and statistical information. The first part, C-value, enhances the common statistical measure of frequency of occurrence for term extraction, making it sensitive to a particular type of multi-word terms, the nested terms. The second part, NC-value, gives: 1) a method for the extraction of term context words (words that tend to appear with terms); 2) the incorporation of information from term context words to the extraction of terms. © 2000 Springer-Verlag.","authors":["Frantzi K.","Ananiadou S.","Mima H."],"cit_count":450,"doi":"10.1007/s007999900023","journal":"International Journal on Digital Libraries","title":"Automatic recognition of multi-word terms: The C-value/NC-value method","type":"Primary","year":"2000-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:termine","biotoolsID":"termine","description":"Input some source text and retrieve a list of terms discovered, ranked by their importance within the text.","homepage":"http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine","name":"termine","version":["1"]}}
