Background: Software container technology such as Docker can be used to package and distribute bioinformatics workflows consisting of multiple software implementations and dependencies. However, Docker is a command line-based tool, and many bioinformatics pipelines consist of components that require a graphical user interface. Results: We present a container tool called GUIdock-VNC that uses a graphical desktop sharing system to provide a browser-based interface for containerized software. GUIdock-VNC uses the Virtual Network Computing protocol to render the graphics within most commonly used browsers. We also present a minimal image builder that can add our proposed graphical desktop sharing system to any Docker packages, with the end result that any Docker packages can be run using a graphical desktop within a browser. In addition, GUIdock-VNC uses the Oauth2 authentication protocols when deployed on the cloud. Conclusions: As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated the utility of GUIdock-noVNC in gene network inference. We benchmarked our container implementation on various operating systems and showed that our solution creates minimal overhead.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Mittal V."}, {"name": "Hung L.-H."}, {"name": "Keswani J."}, {"name": "Kristiyanto D."}, {"name": "Lee S.B."}, {"name": "Yeung K.Y."}], "date": "2017-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "GigaScience"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ka Yee Yeung", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kayee@uw.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:guidock-vnc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/BioDepot/GUIdock-VNC", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Service composition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3762"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-06T10:46:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Using a graphical desktop sharing system to provide a browser-based interface for containerized software.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["JavaScript", "Java", "R", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/BioDepot/GUIdock-VNC/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}], "biotoolsID": "guidock-vnc", "additionDate": "2018-07-15T10:12:10Z", "name": "GUIdock-VNC", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/BioDepot/GUIdock-VNC", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
