Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: DNA sequencing of multiple samples from the same tumor provides data to analyze the process of clonal evolution in the population of cells that give rise to a tumor. Results: We formalize the problem of reconstructing the clonal evolution of a tumor using single-nucleotide mutations as the variant allele frequency (VAF) factorization problem. We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is NP-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the VAF factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.","authors":["El-Kebir M.","Oesper L.","Acheson-Field H.","Raphael B.J."],"cit_count":44,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26072510","title":"Reconstruction of clonal trees and tumor composition from multi-sample sequencing data","year":"2015-06-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ancestree","biotoolsID":"ancestree","description":"Algorithm that infers the clonal evolution and tumor composition, including mixing fractions of a tumor from multi-sample DNA sequence data.","homepage":"http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/ancestree/","name":"AncesTree"}}
