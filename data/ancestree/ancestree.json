Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: DNA sequencing of multiple samples from the same tumor provides data to analyze the process of clonal evolution in the population of cells that give rise to a tumor. Results: We formalize the problem of reconstructing the clonal evolution of a tumor using single-nucleotide mutations as the variant allele frequency (VAF) factorization problem. We derive a combinatorial characterization of the solutions to this problem and show that the problem is NP-complete. We derive an integer linear programming solution to the VAF factorization problem in the case of error-free data and extend this solution to real data with a probabilistic model for errors. The resulting AncesTree algorithm is better able to identify ancestral relationships between individual mutations than existing approaches, particularly in ultra-deep sequencing data when high read counts for mutations yield high confidence VAFs.", "citationCount": 44, "authors": [{"name": "El-Kebir M."}, {"name": "Oesper L."}, {"name": "Acheson-Field H."}, {"name": "Raphael B.J."}], "date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Raphael Lab", "url": "http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ancestree", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/ancestree/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0415"}, {"term": "Molecular dynamics simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Algorithm that infers the clonal evolution and tumor composition, including mixing fractions of a tumor from multi-sample DNA sequence data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/ancestree-inferring-clonal-evolution-of-multi-sample-tumor-sequence-data.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "ancestree", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:21Z", "name": "AncesTree", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/raphael-group/AncesTree", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
