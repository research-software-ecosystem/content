For explorative network building, we have added a comprehensive dataset with regulatory relationships of mammalian DNA-binding transcription factors and their target genes, compiled both from curated resources and from a text mining effort. Query results are visualized using the inherent flexibility of the Cytoscape framework, and network links can be checked against curated database records or against the original publication.",
