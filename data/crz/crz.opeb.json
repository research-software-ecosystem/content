In most cases, the software was a stand-alone application and the upgrading, in terms of analysis functions, database and hardware maintenance, was difficult for the National Meteorological Services (NMSs) in charge of agro-hydro-meteorological monitoring. The web-based solution proposed in this work intends to improve and ensure the sustainability of applications to support national Early Warning Systems (EWSs) for food security.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Niger', 'meteorological', 'NMSs', 'RFE'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.2265V2","name":"CRZ"}}
