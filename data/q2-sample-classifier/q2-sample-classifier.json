    "description": "machine-learning tools for microbiome classification and regression | QIIME 2 plugin for machine learning prediction of sample data | Microbiome studies often aim to predict outcomes or differentiate samples based on their microbial compositions, tasks that can be efficiently performed by supervised learning methods. The q2-sample-classifier plugin makes these methods more accessible, reproducible, and interpretable to a broad audience of microbiologists, clinicians, and others who wish to utilize supervised learning methods for predicting sample characteristics based on microbiome composition or other \"omics\" data",
