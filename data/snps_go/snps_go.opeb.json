The most investigated SNPs are missense mutations resulting in residue substitutions in the protein. Here we propose SNPs&GO, an accurate method that, starting from a protein sequence, can predict whether a mutation is disease related or not by exploiting the protein functional annotation. The scoring efficiency of SNPs&GO is as high as 82%, with a Matthews correlation coefficient equal to 0.63 over a wide set of annotated nonsynonymous mutations in proteins, including 16,330 disease-related and 17,432 neutral polymorphisms. SNPs&GO collects in unique framework information derived from protein sequence, evolutionary information, and function as encoded in the Gene Ontology terms, and outperforms other available predictive methods. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","authors":["Calabrese R.","Capriotti E.","Fariselli P.","Martelli P.L.","Casadio R."],"cit_count":301,"journal":"Human Mutation","pmid":"19514061","title":"Functional annotations improve the predictive score of human disease-related mutations in proteins","year":"2009-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snps_go","biotoolsID":"snps_go","description":"A server for the prediction of single point protein mutations likely to be involved in the insurgence of diseases in humans.","homepage":"http://snps-and-go.biocomp.unibo.it/snps-and-go/","name":"SNPs GO"}}
