The most investigated SNPs are missense mutations resulting in residue substitutions in the protein. Here we propose SNPs&GO, an accurate method that, starting from a protein sequence, can predict whether a mutation is disease related or not by exploiting the protein functional annotation. The scoring efficiency of SNPs&GO is as high as 82%, with a Matthews correlation coefficient equal to 0.63 over a wide set of annotated nonsynonymous mutations in proteins, including 16,330 disease-related and 17,432 neutral polymorphisms. SNPs&GO collects in unique framework information derived from protein sequence, evolutionary information, and function as encoded in the Gene Ontology terms, and outperforms other available predictive methods. \u00a9 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 301, "authors": [{"name": "Calabrese R."}, {"name": "Capriotti E."}, {"name": "Fariselli P."}, {"name": "Martelli P.L."}, {"name": "Casadio R."}], "date": "2009-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Human Mutation"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gigi@biocomp.unibo.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:snps_go", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://snps-and-go.biocomp.unibo.it/snps-and-go/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Virulence prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3461"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A server for the prediction of single point protein mutations likely to be involved in the insurgence of diseases in humans.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/snpsgo-predictor-human-disease-related-mutations-proteins-functional-annotations.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "snps_go", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:00:07Z", "name": "SNPs GO", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://snps-and-go.biocomp.unibo.it/snps-and-go/info.htm", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
