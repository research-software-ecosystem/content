description: "The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the most widely used\
  \ sequence similarity tool. There are versions of BLAST that compare protein queries\
  \ to protein databases, nucleotide queries to nucleotide databases, as well as versions\
  \ that translate nucleotide queries or databases in all six frames and compare to\
  \ protein databases or queries. PSI-BLAST produces a position-specific-scoring-matrix\
  \ (PSSM) starting with a protein query, and then uses that PSSM to perform further\
  \ searches. It is also possible to compare a protein or nucleotide query to a database\
  \ of PSSM\u2019s. The NCBI supports a BLAST web page at blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as\
  \ well as a network service."
