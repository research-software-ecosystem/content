summary: next generation suite of BLAST sequence search tools
description: >
   The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) is the most widely
   used sequence similarity tool. There are versions of BLAST that
   compare protein queries to protein databases, nucleotide queries
   to nucleotide databases, as well as versions that translate nucleotide
   queries or databases in all six frames and compare to protein databases
   or queries.
   PSI-BLAST produces a position-specific-scoring-matrix (PSSM) starting
   with a protein query, and then uses that PSSM to perform further searches.
   It is also possible to compare a protein or nucleotide query to a
   database of PSSM’s.
   The NCBI supports a BLAST web page at blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov as well as
   a network service.
