                "abstract": "RNA chaperone activity is one of the many functions of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDRs function without the prerequisite of a stable structure. Instead, their functions arise from structural ensembles. A common theme in IDR function is molecular recognition; IDRs mediate interactions with other proteins, RNA, and DNA. Many computational methods are available to predict IDRs from protein sequence, but relatively few are available for predicting IDR functions. Available methods primarily focus on protein-protein interactions. DisoRDPbind was developed to predict several protein functions including interactions with RNA. This method is available as a user-friendly web interface, located at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/DisoRDPbind/. The development and architecture of DisoRDPbind is briefly presented, and its accuracy relative to other RNA-binding residue predictors is discussed. We explain usage of the web interface in detail and provide an example of prediction results and interpretation. While DisoRDPbind does not identify RNA chaperones directly, we provide a case study of an RNA chaperone, HCV core protein, as an example of the method’s utility in the study of RNA chaperones.",
