All rights reserved.Motivation: The discovery of sequence motifs mediating DNA-protein binding usually implies the determination of binding sites using high-throughput sequencing and peak calling. The determination of peaks, however, depends strongly on data quality and is susceptible to noise. Results: Here, we present a novel approach to reliably identify transcription factor-binding motifs from ChIP-Seq data without peak detection. By evaluating the distributions of sequencing reads around the different k-mers in the genome, we are able to identify binding motifs in ChIP-Seq data that yield no results in traditional pipelines.
