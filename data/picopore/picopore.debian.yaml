  description: lossless compression of Nanopore files
  long_description: " The Nanopore is a device to determine the sequences of single\
    \ moleculres\n of DNA. No amplification. The output is gigantic and tools like\
    \ this\n one help to reduce it.\n .\n Over time, other means have substitute the\
    \ need for this one. Upstream\n has halted development. Some tutorials and pipelines\
    \ of the Nanopore still\n refer to it, though.\n"
