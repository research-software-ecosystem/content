The results from the Genome Annotation Assessment Project (GASP) showed that GeneWise provided reasonably accurate gene predictions. Further investigation indicates that many of the incorrect gene predictions from GeneWise were due to transposons with valid protein-coding genes and the remaining cases are pseudogenes or possible annotation oversights.",
