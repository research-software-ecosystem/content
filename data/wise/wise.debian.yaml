description: "Wise2 is a package focused on comparisons of biopolymers, commonly DNA\
  \ and protein sequences. There are many other packages which do this, probably the\
  \ best known being BLAST package (from NCBI) and the Fasta package (from Bill Pearson).\
  \ There are other packages, such as the HMMER package (Sean Eddy) or SAM package\
  \ (UC Santa Cruz) focused on hidden Markov models (HMMs) of biopolymers. . Wise2's\
  \ particular forte is the comparison of DNA sequence at the level of its protein\
  \ translation. This comparison allows the simultaneous prediction of say gene structure\
  \ with homology based alignment. . Wise2 also contains other algorithms, such as\
  \ the venerable Smith-Waterman algorithm, or more modern ones such as Stephen Altschul's\
  \ generalised gap penalties, or even experimental ones developed in house, such\
  \ as dba. The development of these algorithms is due to the ease of developing such\
  \ algorithms in the environment used by Wise2. . Wise2 has also been written with\
  \ an eye for reuse and maintainability. Although it is a pure C package you can\
  \ access its functionality directly in Perl. Parts of the package (or the entire\
  \ package) can be used by other C or C++ programs without namespace clashes as all\
  \ externally linked variables have the unique identifier Wise2 prepended.\n"
