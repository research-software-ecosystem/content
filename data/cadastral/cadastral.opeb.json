In France, old cadastral maps are regularly published by the “départements”. Such material is relevant to various applications (on-the-field search of specific objects such as old boundary stakes, historical studies of demography, human activities, land cover…). The GeF laboratory is working on the development of a complete methodological toolchain to vectorise, correct and analyse cadastral parcels and their evolution, using open source software and programming language only (QGIS, GDAL, Python). This article details the use of a part of this toolchain - georeferencing old cadastral data - on parcels located near the Loir river, in two villages of southern Sarthe: Vaas and Aubigné-Racan.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'QGIS', 'GDAL', 'toolchain', 'georeferencing'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.2222V3","name":"cadastral"}}
