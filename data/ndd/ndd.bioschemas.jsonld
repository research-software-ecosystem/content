  "sc:description": "Drug-Drug Interaction Predicting by Neural Network Using Integrated Similarity | Link of paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50121-3 A Novel Method For Predicting Drug-Drug Interaction By Neural Network Due to the great importance of this issue in the economy, industry, and health, proposing appropriate computational methods for predicting unknown DDI with high precision is challenging. We propose a novel machine learning method for predicting unknown DDIs called \"NDD\", using a two-layer fully connected neural network. NDD uses various characteristics of drugs to have comprehensive information. Multiple drug similarities are calculated. NDD integrat various drug similarities with a non-linear similarity fusion method called \"SNF\" to achieve high-level features.
