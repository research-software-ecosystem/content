Sensitive variant calling and hap-lotype inference from population sequencing data remain challenging. We describe methods for high-quality discovery, genotyping, and phasing of SNPs for low-coverage (approximately 53) sequencing of populations, implemented in a pipeline called SNPTools. Our pipeline contains several innovations that specifically address challenges caused by low-coverage population sequencing: (1) effective base depth (EBD), a nonparametric statistic that enables more accurate statistical modeling of sequencing data; (2) variance ratio scoring, a variance-based statistic that discovers polymorphic loci with high sensitivity and specificity; and (3) BAM-specific binomial mixture modeling (BBMM), a clustering algorithm that generates robust genotype likelihoods from heterogeneous sequencing data. Last, we develop an imputation engine that refines raw genotype likelihoods to produce high-quality phased genotypes/haplotypes. Designed for large population studies, SNPTools' input/output (I/O) and storage aware design leads to improved computing performance on large sequencing data sets. We apply SNPTools to the International 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) Phase 1 low-coverage data set and obtain genotyping accuracy comparable to that of SNP microarray. \u00a9 2013, Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 40, "authors": [{"name": "Wang Y."}, {"name": "Lu J."}, {"name": "Yu J."}, {"name": "Gibbs R.A."}, {"name": "Yu F."}], "date": "2013-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jy2@bcm.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "fyu@bcm.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:snptools", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/software/snptools", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "SNP detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0484"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A suite of tools that enables integrative SNP analysis in next generation sequencing data with large cohorts.
