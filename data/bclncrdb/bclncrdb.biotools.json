                "abstract": "Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women, is characterized by high morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recent evidence has shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in the development and progression of breast cancer. However, despite increasing data and evidence indicating the implication of lncRNAs in breast cancer, no web resource or database exists primarily for lncRNAs associated with only breast cancer. Therefore, we developed a manually curated, comprehensive database, “BCLncRDB,” for lncRNAs associated with breast cancer. For this, we collected, processed, and analyzed available data on breast cancer-associated lncRNAs from different sources, including previously published research articles, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Ensembl database; subsequently, these data were hosted at BCLncRDB for public access. Currently, the database contains 5324 unique breast cancer-lncRNA associations and has the following features: (i) a user-friendly, easy-to-use web interface for searching and browsing about lncRNAs of the user’s interest, (ii) differentially expressed and methylated lncRNAs, (iii) stage- and subtype-specific lncRNAs, and (iv) drugs, subcellular localization, sequence, and chromosome information of these lncRNAs. Thus, the BCLncRDB provides a one-stop dedicated platform for exploring breast cancer-related lncRNAs to advance and support the ongoing research on this disease. The BCLncRDB is publicly available for use at http://sls.uohyd.ac.in/new/bclncrdb_v1 .",
