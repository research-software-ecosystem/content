Originally designed with the display of microarray data sets in mind, it is a general tool that can be used to make simple visualizations of matrices for use in figures, web pages, slide presentations and the like. It can also be used to generate images 'on the fly' in web applications. Both continuous-valued and discrete-valued (categorical) data sets can be displayed. Many options are available to the user, including the colors used, the display of row and column labels, and scale bars. In this note we describe some of matrix2png's features and describe some places it has been useful in the authors' work.","authors":["Pavlidis P.","Stafford Noble W."],"cit_count":248,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"12538257","title":"Matrix2png: A utility for visualizing matrix data","year":"2003-02-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:matrix2png","biotoolsID":"matrix2png","description":"Matrix2png is a simple but powerful program for making visualizations of microarray data and many other data types. It generates PNG formatted images from text files of data. It is fast,easy to use, and reasonably flexible. It can be used to generate publication-quality images, or to act as a image generator for web applications. A web interface is included.","homepage":"http://chibi.ubc.ca/matrix2png","name":"Matrix2png"}}
