Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: State-of-the-art light and electron microscopes are capable of acquiring large image datasets, but quantitatively evaluating the data often involves manually annotating structures of interest. This process is time-consuming and often a major bottleneck in the evaluation pipeline. To overcome this problem, we have introduced the Trainable Weka Segmentation (TWS), a machine learning tool that leverages a limited number of manual annotations in order to train a classifier and segment the remaining data automatically. In addition, TWS can provide unsupervised segmentation learning schemes (clustering) and can be customized to employ user-designed image features or classifiers.","authors":["Arganda-Carreras I.","Kaynig V.","Rueden C.","Eliceiri K.W.","Schindelin J.","Cardona A.","Seung H.S."],"cit_count":149,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx180","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Trainable Weka Segmentation: A machine learning tool for microscopy pixel classification","type":"Primary","year":"2017-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Trainable_Weka_Segmentation","biotoolsID":"Trainable_Weka_Segmentation","description":"Machine learning tool for microscopy pixel classification.","homepage":"https://imagej.net/Trainable_Weka_Segmentation","name":"Trainable Weka Segmentation","version":["3.2.33"]}}
