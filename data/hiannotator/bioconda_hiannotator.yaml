description: 'hiAnnotator contains set of functions which allow users to annotate
  a GRanges object with custom set of annotations. The basic philosophy of this package
  is to take two GRanges objects (query & subject) with common set of seqnames (i.e.
  chromosomes) and return associated annotation per seqnames and rows from the query
  matching seqnames and rows from the subject (i.e. genes or cpg islands). The package
  comes with three types of annotation functions which calculates if a position from
  query is: within a feature, near a feature, or count features in defined window
  sizes. Moreover, each function is equipped with parallel backend to utilize the
  foreach package. In addition, the package is equipped with wrapper functions, which
  finds appropriate columns needed to make a GRanges object from a common data frame.'
