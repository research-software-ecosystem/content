  "sc:description": "Tool developed to automate visualization, analysis and exploration of complex and highly resolved microbial growth data, as well as standardized extraction of the fitness components it contains. It is hope that this tool will promote simplicity, transparency and standardization in microbial growth phenomics, and provide a portal with the standalone software and online tools so that other microbiology labs can easily upload, assess and visualize their growth data.",
