As with other molecules, like proteins, visualization of the 3D structures of glycans adds valuable information for understanding their biological function. Hence, here we introduce Azahar, a computing environment for the creation, visualization and analysis of glycan molecules. Azahar is implemented in Python and works as a plugin for the well known PyMOL package (Schrodinger in The PyMOL molecular graphics system, version 1.3r1, 2010). Besides the already available visualization and analysis options provided by PyMOL, Azahar includes 3 cartoon-like representations and tools for 3D structure caracterization such as a comformational search using a Monte Carlo with minimization routine and also tools to analyse single glycans or trajectories/ensembles including the calculation of radius of gyration, Ramachandran plots and hydrogen bonds. Azahar is freely available to download from http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Azahar and the source code is available at https://github.com/agustinaarroyuelo/Azahar.","authors":["Arroyuelo A.","Vila J.A.","Martin O.A."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1007/S10822-016-9944-X","journal":"Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design","pmid":"27549814","title":"Azahar: a PyMOL plugin for construction, visualization and analysis of glycan molecules","year":"2016-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:azahar","biotoolsID":"azahar","description":"PyMOL plugin for construction, visualization and analysis of glycan molecules.","homepage":"https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Azahar","name":"Azahar"}}
