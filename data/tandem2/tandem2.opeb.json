However, observed allele lengths are usually inaccurate and may deviate from the expected periodicity of repeats. The common practice of rounding to the nearest whole number frequently results in miscalls and underestimations of allelic richness. Manual sorting of allele lengths into discrete classes, a process called binning, is tedious and error-prone. Here, we present a new program for the automated binning of microsatellite allele lengths to overcome these problems and to facilitate high-throughput allele binning. © The Author 2009.

Therefore, allele binning is not a trivial task. This tool fills a gap of the microsatellite workflow by rounding allele sizes to valid integers, depending on the microsatellite repeat units.","homepage":"http://www.evoinformatics.eu/tandem2.htm","name":"Tandem2"}}
