    "description": "An automation system for a sequencing core facility.\n\nStackStorm packs to automate sequencing center operations.\n\nEvent-driven sequencing center automation.\n\nIt forms the core of the Arteria automation system, which you can read about on our website or preprint. This pack integrates with a series of bioinformatic micro-services, which can be found at https://github.com/arteria-project.\n\nThis pack provides re-usable units for automating tasks at a sequencing core facility using the StackStorm event-driven automation platform.\n\nHandling sequencing data from massive parallel sequencing can be a daunting task! And while the process of handling sequencing data will share many of its characteristics across centers, the current norm is one center one solution. This creates a situation where reuse is difficult to achieve and the wheel is invented over and over again. This is a situation that we hope can be remedied in the form of the Arteria project",
