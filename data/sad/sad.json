    "description": "Efficient algorithms for sampling feasible sets of abundance distributions.\n\nEcological variables such as species richness ( S ) and total abundance ( N ) can strongly influence ecological patterns. For example, the general form of the species abundance distribution (SAD) can often be explained by the majority of possible forms having the same N and S , i.e. the SAD feasible set. The feasible set reveals how variables determine observable variation, whether empirical patterns are exceptional to the majority of possible forms, and provides a constraint-based explanation for the ubiquity of hollow-curve SADs in nature. However, use of the feasible set has been limited to inefficient sampling algorithms that prevent large ecological communities and ecologically realistic combinations of N and S from being examined.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'hollow-curve', 'SADs', 'zero-values', 'constraint-based'",
