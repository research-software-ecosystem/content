Chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry plays an important role in unravelling protein interactions, especially weak and transient ones. Moreover, cross-linking complements several structural determination approaches such as cryo-EM. Although several computational approaches are available for the annotation of spectra obtained from cross-linked peptides, there remains room for improvement. Here, we present Xilmass, a novel algorithm to identify cross-linked peptides that introduces two new concepts: (i) the cross-linked peptides are represented in the search database such that the cross-linking sites are explicitly encoded, and (ii) the scoring function derived from the Andromeda algorithm was adapted to score against a theoretical tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectrum that contains the peaks from all possible fragment ions of a cross-linked peptide pair. The performance of Xilmass was evaluated against the recently published Kojak and the popular pLink algorithms on a calmodulin-plectin complex data set, as well as three additional, published data sets. The results show that Xilmass typically had the highest number of identified distinct cross-linked sites and also the highest number of predicted cross-linked sites.", "citationCount": 11, "authors": [{"name": "Yllmaz S."}, {"name": "Drepper F."}, {"name": "Hulstaert N."}, {"name": "Cernic M."}, {"name": "Gevaert K."}, {"name": "Economou A."}, {"name": "Warscheid B."}, {"name": "Martens L."}, {"name": "Vandermarliere E."}], "date": "2016-10-18T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ugent.be", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "lennart.martens@ugent.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:xilmass", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["0.2"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/compomics/xilmass", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Mass spectrometry data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2536"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Protein-protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2464"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein structure image", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2992"}, "format": []}, {"data": {"term": "Protein sequence record", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2886"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:42:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An algorithm to identify cross-linked peptides.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "xilmass", "additionDate": "2016-05-17T10:18:32Z", "name": "Xilmass", "license": "Apache-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/compomics/xilmass/wiki", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
