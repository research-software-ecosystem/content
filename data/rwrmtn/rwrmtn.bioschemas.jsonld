      "sc:description": "a tool for predicting disease-associated microRNAs based on a microRNA-target gene network.\n\nThe misregulation of microRNA (miRNA) has been shown to cause diseases. Recently, we have proposed a computational method based on a random walk framework on a miRNA-target gene network to predict disease-associated miRNAs. The prediction performance of our method is better than that of some existing state-of-the-art network- and machine learning-based methods since it exploits the mutual regulation between miRNAs and their target genes in the miRNA-target gene interaction networks.\n\nTo facilitate the use of this method, we have developed a Cytoscape app, named RWRMTN, to predict disease-associated miRNAs.",
