Here, we introduce new algorithms for prediction of the minimum free energy pseudoknot-free secondary structure of two or more nucleic acid molecules, and for prediction of alternative low-energy (sub-optimal) secondary structures for two nucleic acid molecules. We provide a comprehensive analysis of our predictions against secondary structures of interacting RNA molecules drawn from the literature. Analysis of our tools on 17 sequences of up to 200 nucleotides that do not form pseudoknots shows that they have 79% accuracy, on average, for the minimum free energy predictions. When the best of 100 sub-optimal foldings is taken, the average accuracy increases to 91%. The accuracy decreases as the sequences increase in length and as the number of pseudoknots and tertiary interactions increases. Our algorithms extend the free energy minimization algorithm of Zuker & Stiegler for secondary structure prediction, and the sub-optimal folding algorithm by Wuchty et al.
