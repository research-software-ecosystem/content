All rights reserved.Elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis is a powerful technique for determining the metabolic capacities and robustness of stoichiometric networks. Recently, several improvements have been made to the algorithm for enumerating the EFMs, making the study of large models possible. However, currently these tools require high performance workstations to perform large-scale EFM computations, thus limiting their applicability. We developed a more time and memory efficient implementation of the algorithm for EFM enumeration in MATLAB, called FluxModeCalculator, which enables large-scale EFM computation on ordinary desktop computers.",
