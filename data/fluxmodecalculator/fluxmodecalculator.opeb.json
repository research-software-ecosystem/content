All rights reserved.Elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis is a powerful technique for determining the metabolic capacities and robustness of stoichiometric networks. Recently, several improvements have been made to the algorithm for enumerating the EFMs, making the study of large models possible. However, currently these tools require high performance workstations to perform large-scale EFM computations, thus limiting their applicability. We developed a more time and memory efficient implementation of the algorithm for EFM enumeration in MATLAB, called FluxModeCalculator, which enables large-scale EFM computation on ordinary desktop computers.","authors":["Van Klinken J.B.","Willems Van Dijk K."],"cit_count":7,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26685305","title":"FluxModeCalculator: An efficient tool for large-scale flux mode computation","year":"2016-04-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fluxmodecalculator","biotoolsID":"fluxmodecalculator","description":"MATLAB toolbox for computing the elementary flux modes, extreme pathways or minimal generating sets in stoichiometric models","homepage":"https://www.lumc.nl/org/humane-genetica/medewerkers/jan-bert-van-klinken","name":"FluxModeCalculator"}}
