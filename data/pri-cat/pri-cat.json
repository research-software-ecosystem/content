                "abstract": "Although several tools for the analysis of ChIP-seq data have been published recently, there is a growing demand, in particular in the plant research community, for computational resources with which such data can be processed, analyzed, stored, visualized and integrated within a single, user-friendly environment. To accommodate this demand, we have developed PRI-CAT (Plant Research International ChIP-seq analysis tool), a web-based workflow tool for the management and analysis of ChIP-seq experiments. PRI-CAT is currently focused on Arabidopsis, but will be extended with other plant species in the near future. Users can directly submit their sequencing data to PRI-CAT for automated analysis. A QuickLoad server compatible with genome browsers is implemented for the storage and visualization of DNA-binding maps. Submitted datasets and results can be made publicly available through PRI-CAT, a feature that will enable community-based integrative analysis and visualization of ChIP-seq experiments. Secondary analysis of data can be performed with the aid of GALAXY, an external framework for tool and data integration. PRI-CAT is freely available at http://www.ab.wur.nl/pricat. No login is required. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).",
