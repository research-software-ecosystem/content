  "sc:description": "A web-based software package for comparative genomics, whose primary goal is to facilitate the analysis and visualization of comparative genome data, with a particular emphasis on protein and gene cluster data. Herein, a two-phase protein clustering algorithm, used to generate protein clusters suitable for analysis through Sybil and a method for creating graphical displays of protein or gene clusters that span multiple genomes are described.",
