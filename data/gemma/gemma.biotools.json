                "abstract": "Motivation: Many microarray datasets are available online with formalized standards describing the probe sequences and expression values. Unfortunately, the description, conditions and parameters of the experiments are less commonly formalized and often occur as natural language text. This hinders searching, high-throughput analysis, organization and integration of the datasets. Results: We use the lexical resources and software tools from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to extract concepts from text. We then link the UMLS concepts to classes in open biomedical ontologies. The result is accessible and clear semantic annotations of gene expression experiments. We applied the method to 595 expression experiments from Gemma, a resource for re-use and meta-analysis of gene expression profiling data. We evaluated and corrected all stages of the annotation process. The majority of missed annotations were due to a lack of cross-references. The most error-prone stage was the extraction of concepts from phrases. Final review of the annotations in context of the experiments revealed 89% precision. A naive system, lacking the phrase to concept corrections is 68% precise. We have integrated this annotation pipeline into Gemma. Â© 2009 The Author(s).",

                "abstract": "Vast amounts of transcriptomic data reside in public repositories, but effective reuse remains challenging. Issues include unstructured dataset metadata, inconsistent data processing and quality control, and inconsistent probe-gene mappings across microarray technologies. Thus, extensive curation and data reprocessing are necessary prior to any reuse. The Gemma bioinformatics system was created to help address these issues. Gemma consists of a database of curated transcriptomic datasets, analytical software, a web interface and web services. Here we present an update on Gemma's holdings, data processing and analysis pipelines, our curation guidelines, and software features. As of June 2020, Gemma contains 10 811 manually curated datasets (primarily human, mouse and rat), over 395 000 samples and hundreds of curated transcriptomic platforms (both microarray and RNA sequencing). Dataset topics were represented with 10 215 distinct terms from 12 ontologies, for a total of 54 316 topic annotations (mean topics/dataset = 5.2). While Gemma has broad coverage of conditions and tissues, it captures a large majority of available brain-related datasets, accounting for 34% of its holdings. Users can access the curated data and differential expression analyses through the Gemma website, RESTful service and an R package. Database URL: https://gemma.msl.ubc.ca/home.html",
