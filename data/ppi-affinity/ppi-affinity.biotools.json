All rights reserved.Virtual screening of protein-protein and protein-peptide interactions is a challenging task that directly impacts the processes of hit identification and hit-to-lead optimization in drug design projects involving peptide-based pharmaceuticals. Although several screening tools designed to predict the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes have been proposed, methods specifically developed to predict protein-peptide binding affinity are comparatively scarce. Frequently, predictors trained to score the affinity of small molecules are used for peptides indistinctively, despite the larger complexity and heterogeneity of interactions rendered by peptide binders. To address this issue, we introduce PPI-Affinity, a tool that leverages support vector machine (SVM) predictors of binding affinity to screen datasets of protein-protein and protein-peptide complexes, as well as to generate and rank mutants of a given structure. The performance of the SVM models was assessed on four benchmark datasets, which include protein-protein and protein-peptide binding affinity data. In addition, we evaluated our model on a set of mutants of EPI-X4, an endogenous peptide inhibitor of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and on complexes of the serine proteases HTRA1 and HTRA3 with peptides.
