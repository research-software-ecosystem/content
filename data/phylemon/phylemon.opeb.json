It has been designed as a response to the increasing demand of molecular sequence analyses for experts and non-expert users. Phylemon 2.0 has several unique features that differentiates it from other similar web resources: (i) it offers an integrated environment that enables evolutionary analyses, format conversion, file storage and edition of results; (ii) it suggests further analyses, thereby guiding the users through the web server; and (iii) it allows users to design and save phylogenetic pipelines to be used over multiple genes (phylogenomics). Altogether, Phylemon 2.0 integrates a suite of 30 tools covering sequence alignment reconstruction and trimming; tree reconstruction, visualization and manipulation; and evolutionary hypotheses testing. © 2011 The Author(s).","authors":["Sanchez R.","Serra F.","Tarraga J.","Medina I.","Carbonell J.","Pulido L.","De Maria A.","Capella-Gutierrez S.","Huerta-Cepas J.","Gabaldon T.","Dopazo J.","Dopazo H."],"cit_count":98,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkr408","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"Phylemon 2.0: A suite of web-tools for molecular evolution, phylogenetics, phylogenomics and hypotheses testing","type":"Primary","year":"2011-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:phylemon","biotoolsID":"phylemon","description":"Suite of web-tools for molecular evolution, phylogenetics, phylogenomics and hypotheses testing.
