      "sc:description": "a novel programmatic tool for deep learning based de novo drug design for a target of interest.\n\nThe on-going data-science and AI revolution offers researchers with fresh set of tools to approach structure-based drug design problems in the computer aided drug design space. A novel programmatic tool that can be used in aid of in silico-deep learning based de novo drug design for any target of interest has been reported. Once the user specifies the target of interest, the programmatic workflow of the tool generates novel SMILES of compounds that are likely to be active against the target. The tool also performs a computationally efficient In-Silico modeling of the target and the newly generated compounds and stores the results in the working folder of the user. A demonstrated use of the tool has been shown with the target signatures of Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha, an important therapeutic target in the case of anti-inflammatory treatment",
