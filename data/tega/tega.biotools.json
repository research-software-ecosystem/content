                "abstract": "© 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Genética.Population genetics studies the distributions and changes in population allele frequencies in response to processes, such as mutation, natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift. Researchers daily manage genetic, biological, and environmental data of the samples, storing them in text files or spreadsheets, which makes it difficult to maintain con-sistency and traceability. Here we present TEGA, a WEB-based stand-alone software developed for the easy analysis and management of population genetics data. It was designed to: 1) facilitate data management, 2) provide a way to execute the analysis procedures, and 3) supply a means to publish data, procedures, and results. TEGA is distributed under the GNU AGPL v3 license. The documentation, source code, and screenshots are available at https://github.com/darioelias/TEGA. In addition, we present Rabid Fish, the first implementation of TEGA in the Genetics Labortory of the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences at the National University of the Litoral, where research focuses on population genetics studies applied to non-model organisms.",
