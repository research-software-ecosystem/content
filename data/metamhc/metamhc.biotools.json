                "abstract": "As antigenic peptides binding to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is the prerequisite of cellular immune responses, an accurate computational predictor will be of great benefit to biologists and immunologists for understanding the underlying mechanism of immune recognition as well as facilitating the process of epitope mapping and vaccine design. Although various computational approaches have been developed, recent experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the development of improved predictors is needed, especially for MHC Class II peptide binding. To make the most of current methods and achieve a higher predictive performance, we developed a new web server, MetaMHC, to integrate the outputs of leading predictors by several popular ensemble strategies. MetaMHC consists of two components: MetaMHCI and MetaMHCII for MHC Class I peptide and MHC Class II peptide binding predictions, respectively. Experimental results by both cross-validation and using an independent data set show that the ensemble approaches outperform individual predictors, being statistically significant.
