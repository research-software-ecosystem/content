Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Kinase-regulated phosphorylation is a ubiquitous type of post-translational modification (PTM) in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Phosphorylation plays fundamental roles in many signalling pathways and biological processes, such as protein degradation and protein-protein interactions. Experimental studies have revealed that signalling defects caused by aberrant phosphorylation are highly associated with a variety of human diseases, especially cancers. In light of this, a number of computational methods aiming to accurately predict protein kinase family-specific or kinase-specific phosphorylation sites have been established, thereby facilitating phosphoproteomic data analysis. Results: In this work, we present Quokka, a novel bioinformatics tool that allows users to rapidly and accurately identify human kinase family-regulated phosphorylation sites. Quokka was developed by using a variety of sequence scoring functions combined with an optimized logistic regression algorithm. We evaluated Quokka based on well-prepared up-to-date benchmark and independent test datasets, curated from the Phospho.ELM and UniProt databases, respectively. The independent test demonstrates that Quokka improves the prediction performance compared with state-of-the-art computational tools for phosphorylation prediction. In summary, our tool provides users with high-quality predicted human phosphorylation sites for hypothesis generation and biological validation.", "citationCount": 22, "authors": [{"name": "Li F."}, {"name": "Li C."}, {"name": "Marquez-Lago T.T."}, {"name": "Leier A."}, {"name": "Akutsu T."}, {"name": "Purcell A.W."}, {"name": "Smith A.I."}, {"name": "Lithgow T."}, {"name": "Daly R.J."}, {"name": "Song J."}, {"name": "Chou K.-C."}], "date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Fuyi Li", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "fuyi.li1@monash.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:Quokka", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://quokka.erc.monash.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Post-translation modification site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"}, {"term": "PTM localisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3755"}, {"term": "Regression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3659"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-06T14:48:05Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for rapid and accurate prediction of kinase family-specific phosphorylation sites in the human proteome.", "toolType": ["Web application", "Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://quokka.erc.monash.edu/index.html#webserver", "note": "Web server", "type": "Other"}], "biotoolsID": "Quokka", "additionDate": "2019-07-06T14:48:05Z", "name": "Quokka", "license": "Unlicense", "documentation": [], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
