Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Meta-Analysis of summary statistics is an essential approach to guarantee the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Application of the fixed or random effects model to single-marker association tests is a standard practice. More complex methods of meta-Analysis involving multiple parameters have not been used frequently, a gap that could be explained by the lack of a respective meta-Analysis pipeline. Meta-Analysis based on combining p-values can be applied to any association test. However, to be powerful, meta-Analysis methods for high-dimensional models should incorporate additional information such as study-specific properties of parameter estimates, their effect directions, standard errors and covariance structure. Results: We modified 'method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes' recently proposed in the educational sciences to the case of multiple logistic regression, and implemented it in a meta-Analysis tool called METAINTER. The software handles models with an arbitrary number of parameters, andcan directly be applied to analyze the results of single-SNP tests, global haplotype tests, tests for and under gene-gene or gene-environment interaction. Via simulations for two-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) models we have shown that the proposed meta-Analysis method has correct type I error rate. Moreover, power estimates come close to that of the joint analysis of the entire sample. We conducted a real data analysis of six GWAS of type 2 diabetes, available from dbGaP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). For each study, a genome-wide interaction analysis of all SNP pairs was performed by logistic regression tests. The results were then metaanalyzed with METAINTER.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Vaitsiakhovich T."}, {"name": "Drichel D."}, {"name": "Herold C."}, {"name": "Lacour A."}, {"name": "Becker T."}], "date": "2015-01-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://metainter.meb.uni-bonn.de/Contact.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:metainter", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://metainter.meb.uni-bonn.de/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Regression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3659"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool to perform meta-analysis of summary statistics obtained from a series of related studies.
