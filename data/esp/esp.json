Accurate variation and genotype-phenotype databases are critical in our ability tomake sense of the vast amount of information thatMPSgenerates. The purpose of this review is to summarize the state of the art of variation and genotype-phenotype databases, how they can be used, and opportunities to improve these resources. Our working assumption is that the objective of the clinical genomicist is to identify highly penetrant variants that could explain existing disease or predict disease risk for individual patients or research participants. We have detailed how current databases contribute to this goal providing frequency data, literature reviews and predictions of causation for individual variants. For variant annotation, databases vary greatly in their ease of use, the use of standard mutation nomenclature, the comprehensiveness of the variant cataloging and the degree of expert opinion. Ultimately, we need a dynamic and comprehensive reference database of medically important variants that is easily cross referenced to exome and genome sequence data and allows for an accumulation of expert opinion.", "citationCount": 36, "authors": [{"name": "Johnston J.J."}, {"name": "Biesecker L.G."}], "date": "2013-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Human Molecular Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "evsserver@uw.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:esp", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "Variant filtering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3675"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-06-16T15:54:17Z", "otherID": [], "description": "NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (ESP): Exome Variant Server (EVS) for browsing single nucleotide variation data from exome sequencing experiments mainly focused on heart, lung and blood disorders.", "toolType": ["Web application", "Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "esp", "additionDate": "2017-09-26T07:49:23Z", "name": "ESP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
