description: This package implements functions to retrieve the nearest genes around
  the peak, annotate genomic region of the peak, statstical methods for estimate the
  significance of overlap among ChIP peak data sets, and incorporate GEO database
  for user to compare the own dataset with those deposited in database. The comparison
  can be used to infer cooperative regulation and thus can be used to generate hypotheses.
  Several visualization functions are implemented to summarize the coverage of the
  peak experiment, average profile and heatmap of peaks binding to TSS regions, genomic
  annotation, distance to TSS, and overlap of peaks or genes.
