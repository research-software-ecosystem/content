    "description": "UCell is an R package for calculating gene signatures in single-cell datasets. UCell scores, based on the Mann-Whitney U statistic, are robust to dataset size and heterogeneity, and their calculation demands relatively less computing time and memory than other available methods, enabling the processing of large datasets. UCell can be applied to any cell vs. gene data matrix, and includes functions to directly interact with Seurat objects.",
