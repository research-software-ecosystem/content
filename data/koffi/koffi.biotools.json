Published by Oxford University Press.The kinetics of featured interactions (KOFFI) database is a novel tool and resource for binding kinetics data from biomolecular interactions. While binding kinetics data are abundant in literature, finding valuable information is a laborious task. We used text extraction methods to store binding rates (association, dissociation) as well as corresponding meta-information (e.g. methods, devices) in a novel database. To date, over 270 articles were manually curated and binding data on over 1705 interactions was collected and stored in the (KOFFI) database. Moreover, the KOFFI database application programming interface was implemented in Anabel (open-source software for the analysis of binding interactions), enabling users to directly compare their own binding data analyses with related experiments described in the database.",
