    "description": "Characterization and Identification of Lysine Succinylation Sites based on Deep Learning Method.\n\nQuick prediction by UniProtKB ID or AC.\n\nCNN-SuccSite is a web server for identifying Succinylation sites. Succinylation is a type of protein post-translational modification (PTM), which involves the attachment of a succinyl group to a lysine residue. It has been reported that protein succinylation can play important roles in a variety of cellular processes. Due to an increasing number of site-specific succinylated peptides obtained from high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS), some tools have been developed for computationally identifying succinylated lysine sites on proteins.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'succinylation', 'succinylated'",
