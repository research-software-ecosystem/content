The BOIN designs are novel “model-assisted” phase I trial designs that can be implemented simply and transparently, similar to the 3 + 3 design, but yield excellent performance comparable to those of more complicated, model-based designs. The BOIN package provides tools for designing, conducting, and analyzing single-agent and drug-combination dose-finding trials.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Despite decades of extensive research, the progress in developing effective treatments for primary brain tumors lags behind that of other cancers, largely due to the unique challenges of brain tumors (eg, the blood-brain barrier and high heterogeneity) that limit the delivery and efficacy of many therapeutic agents. One way to address this issue is to employ novel trial designs to better optimize the treatment regimen (eg, dose and schedule) in early phase trials to improve the success rate of subsequent phase III trials. The objective of this article is to introduce Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) designs as a novel platform to design various types of early phase brain tumor trials, including single-agent and combination regimen trials, trials with late-onset toxicities, and trials aiming to find the optimal biological dose (OBD) based on both toxicity and efficacy. Unlike many novel Bayesian adaptive designs, which are difficult to understand and complicated to implement by clinical investigators, the BOIN designs are self-explanatory and user friendly, yet yield more robust and powerful operating characteristics than conventional designs. We illustrate the BOIN designs using a phase I clinical trial of brain tumor and provide software (freely available at www.trialdesign.org) to facilitate the application of the BOIN design.",

                "abstract": "PURPOSE: Using novel Bayesian adaptive designs has great potential to improve the efficiency of early-phase clinical trials. A major barrier for clinical researchers to adopt novel designs is the lack of easy-to-use software. Our purpose is to develop a user-friendly software platform to implement novel clinical trial designs that address various challenges in early-phase dose-finding trials. METHODS: We used R Shiny to develop a web-based software platform to facilitate the use of recent novel adaptive designs. RESULTS: We developed a web-based software suite, called Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) suite, which includes R Shiny applications to handle various clinical settings, including single-agent phase I trials with and without prior information, trials with late-onset toxicity, trials to find the optimal biological dose based on risk-benefit trade-off, and drug combination trials to find a single maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the MTD contour. The applications are built using the same software architecture to ensure the best and a uniform user experience, and they are developed using a proven software development standard operating procedure to ensure accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility. The suite is freely available with internet access and a web browser without the need of installing any other software. CONCLUSION: The BOIN suite allows clinical researchers to design various types of early-phase clinical trials under a unified framework. This work is extremely important because it not only advances the clinical research and drug development by facilitating the use of novel trial designs with optimal performance but also enhances collaborations between biostatisticians and clinicians by disseminating novel statistical methodology to broader scientific communities through user-friendly software. The BOIN suite establishes a KISS principle: keep it simple, but smart.",
