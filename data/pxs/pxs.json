We analyzed data from 459,613 participants of the UK Biobank to investigate the independent and combined roles of demographics (e.g., sex and age), 96 environmental exposures, and common genetic variants in atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 2 diabetes. We develop an additive modelling approach to estimate and validate a poly-exposure score (PXS) that goes beyond consideration of a handful of factors such as smoking and pollution",
