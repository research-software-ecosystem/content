  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>The smoothing is applied by the way of a bi-exponential filter, itself realized by a pair of one-tap recursions. It is therefore very fast; moreover, its computational cost is truly independent of the amount of smoothing. Meanwhile, the preservation of edges is obtained by a range filter akin to the range filter found in a bilateral filter. More technical details are available&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bigwww.epfl.ch/preprints/thevenaz1201p.html\">here</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plugin allows one to control the amount of smoothing, the type of range filter, its broadness, and to iterate the filter several times if desired. We illustrate in Figure 2 a possible outcome of this filter. Here, we iterated the BEEPS 10 times with a Gaussian range filter, σ = 10, and the spatial decay λ = 0.1.</p>\r\n",
