about:
  description: The Delta-Delta-Ct (ddCt) Algorithm is an approximation method to determine
    relative gene expression with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments.
    Compared to other approaches, it requires no standard curve for each primer-target
    pair, therefore reducing the working load and yet returning accurate enough results
    as long as the assumptions of the amplification efficiency hold. The ddCt package
    implements a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results, for example
    those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the ddCt method. The pipeline can
    be either invoked by a script in command-line or through the API consisting of
    S4-Classes, methods and functions.
