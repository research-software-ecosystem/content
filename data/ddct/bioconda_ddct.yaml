description: The Delta-Delta-Ct (ddCt) Algorithm is an approximation method to determine
  relative gene expression with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments.
  Compared to other approaches, it requires no standard curve for each primer-target
  pair, therefore reducing the working load and yet returning accurate enough results
  as long as the assumptions of the amplification efficiency hold. The ddCt package
  implements a pipeline to collect, analyse and visualize qRT-PCR results, for example
  those from TaqMan SDM software, mainly using the ddCt method. The pipeline can be
  either invoked by a script in command-line or through the API consisting of S4-Classes,
  methods and functions.
