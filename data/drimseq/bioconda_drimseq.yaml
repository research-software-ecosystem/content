biotools_id: drimseq
description: The package provides two frameworks. One for the differential transcript
  usage analysis between different conditions and one for the tuQTL analysis. Both
  are based on modeling the counts of genomic features (i.e., transcripts) with the
  Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. The package also makes available functions for
  visualization and exploration of the data and results.
