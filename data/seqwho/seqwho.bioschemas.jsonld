      "sc:description": "SeqWho is a reliable and extremely rapid program designed to determin a FASTQ(A) sequencing file identity, both sourse protocol and species of origin. This is accomplished using an alignment-free algorithm that leverages a Random Forest classifier that learns from biases in k-mer frequencies and repeat sequence identity. SeqWho is capable of achieving greater than 96% accuracy in it’s ability to classify files.",
