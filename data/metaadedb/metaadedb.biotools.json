Additionally, Compared to the previous version, MetaADEDB 2.0 has an over 40% increase in drug-ADE associations and almost 200% growth in the total number of compounds. Notably, we directly generated a unique identifier for each compound based on the chemical structure, and UMLS ID was used as unique identifier for ADE to ensure the quality of data.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: MetaADEDB is an online database we developed to integrate comprehensive information on adverse drug events (ADEs). The first version of MetaADEDB was released in 2013 and has been widely used by researchers. However, it has not been updated for more than seven years. Here, we reported its second version by collecting more and newer data from the U.S. FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Canada Vigilance Adverse Reaction Online Database, in addition to the original three sources. The new version consists of 744 709 drug-ADE associations between 8498 drugs and 13 193 ADEs, which has an over 40% increase in drug-ADE associations compared to the previous version. Meanwhile, we developed a new and user-friendly web interface for data search and analysis. We hope that MetaADEDB 2.0 could provide a useful tool for drug safety assessment and related studies in drug discovery and development. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The database is freely available at: http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/metaadedb/. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
