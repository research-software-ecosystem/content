  "sc:description": "This tool implements a set of five open-source R functions that allow the user to acquire data from public sources such as GEO, train a set of Lasso models on that data, and directly map one microarray platform to another. It significantly predicts expression levels with higher fidelity than technical replicates of the same RNA pool, demonstrating its utility in the integration of data sets from different platforms.",
