                "abstract": "The polymorphism in microRNA target site (PolymiRTS) database aims to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect miRNA targeting in human and mouse. These polymorphisms can disrupt the regulation of gene expression by miRNAs and are candidate genetic variants responsible for transcriptional and phenotypic variation. The database is therefore organized to provide links between SNPs in miRNA target sites, cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), and the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of human diseases. Here, we describe new features that have been integrated in the PolymiRTS database, including: (i) polymiRTSs in genes associated with human diseases and traits in GWAS, (ii) polymorphisms in target sites that have been supported by a variety of experimental methods and (iii) polymorphisms in miRNA seed regions. A large number of newly identified microRNAs and SNPs, recently published mouse phenotypes, and human and mouse eQTLs have also been integrated into the database. The PolymiRTS database is available at http://compbio.uthsc.edu/miRSNP/. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.",
