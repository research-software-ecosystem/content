    "description": "Single-cell RNA-seq Hyper-fast and Accurate processing via ensemble Random Projection.\n\nSHARP, short for Single-cell RNA-seq Hyper-fast and Accurate processing via ensemble Random Projection, is a bioinformatics tool to process and analyze single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. Algorithmically, SHARP is based on ensemble random projection (RP) and multi-layer meta-clustering which can well preserve cell-to-cell distance in reduced-dimensional space. Compared to other existing tools, it has the following advantages:.\n\nNumber of Random-Projection Applications.\n\nProcessing 1.3 Million Single Cells.",

After six months, it is available under a Creative Commons License (Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International), as described at http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/.To process large-scale single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data effectively without excessive distortion during dimension reduction, we present SHARP, an ensemble random projection-based algorithm that is scalable to clustering 10 million cells. Comprehensive benchmarking tests on 17 public scRNA-seq data sets show that SHARP outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Particularly, for large-size data sets (more than 40,000 cells), SHARP runs faster than other competitors while maintaining high clustering accuracy and robustness. To the best of our knowledge, SHARP is the only R-based tool that is scalable to clustering scRNA-seq data with 10 million cells.",
