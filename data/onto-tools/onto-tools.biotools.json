                "abstract": "Microarrays are at the center of a revolution in biotechnology, allowing researchers to screen tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Typically, they have been used in exploratory research to help formulate hypotheses. In most cases, this phase is followed by a more focused, hypothesis-driven stage in which certain specific biological processes and pathways are thought to be involved. Since a single biological process can still involve hundreds of genes, microarrays are still the preferred approach as proven by the availability of focused arrays from several manufacturers. Because focused arrays from different manufacturers use different sets of genes, each array will represent any given regulatory pathway to a different extent. We argue that a functional analysis of the arrays available should be the most important criterion used in the array selection. We developed Onto-Compare as a database that can provide this functionality, based on the Gene Ontology Consortium nomenclature. We used this tool to compare several arrays focused on apoptosis, oncogenes, and tumor suppressors. We considered arrays from BD Biosciences Clontech, PerkinElmer, Sigma-Genosys, and SuperArray. We showed that among the oncogene arrays, the PerkinElmer MICROMAX\u2122 oncogene microarray has a better representation of oncogenesis, protein phosphorylation, and negative control of cell proliferation. The comparison of the apoptosis arrays showed that most apoptosis-related biological processes are equally well represented on the arrays considered. However, functional categories such as immune response, cell-cell signaling, cell-surface receptor linked signal transduction, and interleukins are better represented on the Sigma-Genosys Panorama\u2122 human apoptosis array. At the same time, processes such as cell cycle control, oncogenesis, and negative control of cell proliferation are better represented on the BD Biosciences Clontech Atlas Select\u2122 human apoptosis array.",

Onto-Express is able to automatically translate lists of genes found to be differentially regulated in a given condition into functional profiles characterizing the impact of the condition studied upon various biological processes and pathways. OE constructs functional profiles (using Gene Ontology terms) for the following categories: biochemical function, biological process, cellular role, cellular component, molecular function and chromosome location. Statistical significance values are calculated for each category. Once the initial exploratory analysis identified a number of relevant biological processes, specific mechanisms of interactions can be hypothesized for the conditions studied. Currently, many commercial arrays are available for the investigation of specific mechanisms. Each such array is characterized by a biological bias determined by the extent to which the genes present on the array represent specific pathways. Onto-Compare is a tool that allows efficient comparisons of any sets of commercial or custom arrays. Using Onto-Compare, a researcher can determine quickly which array, or set of arrays, covers best the hypotheses studied. In many situations, no commercial arrays are available for specific biological mechanisms. Onto-Design is a tool that allows the user to select genes that represent given functional categories. Onto-Translate allows the user to translate easily lists of accession numbers, UniGene clusters and Affymetrix probes into one another. All tools above are seamlessly integrated.

To interpret the biology of these genetic profiles, investigators must analyze this data in the context of other information such as the biological, biochemical, or molecular function of the translated proteins. This is particularly challenging for a human analyst because large quantities of less than relevant data often bury such information. To address this need we implemented an automated routine, called Onto-Express (http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu:8080), to systematically translate genetic fingerprints into functional profiles. Using strings of accession or cluster identification numbers, Onto-Express searches the public databases and returns tables that correlate expression profiles with the cytogenetic locations, biochemical and molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and cellular roles of the translated proteins. The profiles created by Onto-Express fundamentally increase the value of gene expression analyses by facilitating the translation of quantitative value sets to records that contain biological implications.",

Independent of the methods used to select these genes, the common task faced by any researcher is to translate these lists of genes into a better understanding of the biological phenomena involved. Currently, this is done through a tedious combination of searches through the literature and a number of public databases. We developed Onto-Express (OE) as a novel tool able to automatically translate such lists of differentially regulated genes into functional profiles characterizing the impact of the condition studied. OE constructs functional profiles (using Gene Ontology terms) for the following categories: biochemical function, biological process, cellular role, cellular component, molecular function, and chromosome location. Statistical significance values are calculated for each category. We demonstrate the validity and the utility of this comprehensive global analysis of gene function by analyzing two breast cancer datasets from two separate laboratories.

                "abstract": "The Onto-Tools suite is composed of an annotation database and five seamlessly integrated web-accessible data mining tools: Onto-Express (OE), Onto-Compare (OC), Onto-Design (OD), Onto-Translate (OT) and Onto-Miner (OM). OM is a new tool that provides a unified access point and an application programming interface for most annotations available. Our database has been enhanced with more than 120 new commercial microarrays and annotations for Rattus norvegicus, Drosophila melanogaster and Carnorhabditis elegans. The Onto-Tools have been redesigned to provide better biological insight, improved performance and user convenience. The new features implemented in OE include support for gene names, LocusLink IDs and Gene Ontology (GO) IDs, ability to specify fold changes for the input genes, links to the KEGG pathway database and detailed output files. OC allows comparisons of the functional bias of more than 170 commercial microarrays. The latest version of OD allows the user to specify keywords if the exact GO term is not known as well as providing more details than the previous version. OE, OC and OD now have an integrated GO browser that allows the user to customize the level of abstraction for each GO category. The Onto-Tools are available online at http://vortex.cs.wayne.edu/Projects.html. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
