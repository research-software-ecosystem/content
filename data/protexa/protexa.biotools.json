    "description": "A tool for post-processing proteomics data providing differential expression metrics, co-expression networks and functional analytics.\n\nProTExA is a web-tool that provides a post-processing workflow for the analysis of protein and gene expression datasets. Using network-based bioinformatics approaches, ProTExA facilitates differential expression analysis and co-expression network analysis as well as pathway and post-pathway analysis. Specifically, for a given set of protein-gene expression data across samples, ProTExA: (1) performs statistical analysis and filtering to highlight the differentially expressed proteins-genes, (2) performs enrichment analysis to identify top-scored pathways, (3) generates pathway-to-pathway and pathway-to-gene networks (4) generates protein and gene co-expression networks using a variety of methodologies, and (5) applies clustering methodologies to identify sub-networks of co-expressed proteins-genes",
