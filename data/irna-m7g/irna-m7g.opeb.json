However, our knowledge about its biological functions is very limited. In order to reveal its new functions, it is necessary to develop various methods to identify m7G sites. Since experimental methods to detect m7G sites are still expensive, we proposed the first computational method, called iRNA-m7G, to detect m7G sites in Homo Sapiens. iRNA-m7G is developed by fusing multiple features, i.e., nucleotide property & frequency, pseudo dinucleotide composition, and secondary structure composition. The framework of iRNA-m7G is shown as following","homepage":"http://lin-group.cn/server/iRNA-m7G/","name":"iRNA-m7G"}}
