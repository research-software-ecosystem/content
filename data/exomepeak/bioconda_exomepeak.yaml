summary: 'The package is developed for the analysis of affinity-based epitranscriptome
  shortgun sequencing data from MeRIP-seq (maA-seq). It was built on the basis of
  the exomePeak MATLAB package (Meng, Jia, et al. "Exome-based analysis for RNA epigenome
  sequencing data." Bioinformatics 29.12 (2013): 1565-1567.) with new functions for
  differential analysis of two experimental conditions to unveil the dynamics in post-transcriptional
  regulation of the RNA methylome. The exomePeak R-package accepts and statistically
  supports multiple biological replicates, internally removes PCR artifacts and multi-mapping
  reads, outputs exome-based binding sites (RNA methylation sites) and detects differential
  post-transcriptional RNA modification sites between two experimental conditions
  in term of percentage rather the absolute amount. The package is still under active
  development, and we welcome all biology and computation scientist for all kinds
  of collaborations and communications. Please feel free to contact Dr. Jia Meng <jia.meng@hotmail.com>
  if you have any questions.'
