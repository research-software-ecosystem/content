  description: Transcript assembly, differential expression and regulation for RNA-Seq
  long_description: " Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances,
    and\n tests for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples.\n It
    accepts aligned RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a\n parsimonious
    set of transcripts. Cufflinks then estimates the\n relative abundances of these
    transcripts based on how many reads\n support each one.\n .\n This package provides
    the binary of cufflinks and associated tools, i.e.\n compress_gtf, cuffcompare,
    cuffdiff, cuffmerge, cuffnorm, cuffquant and\n gtf_to_sam.\n"
