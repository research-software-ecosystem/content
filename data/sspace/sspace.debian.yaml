summary: scaffolding pre-assembled contigs after extension
description: >
   SSAKE-based Scaffolding of Pre-Assembled Contigs after Extension (SSPACE)
   is a script able to extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs using one or
   more mate pairs or paired-end libraries, or even a combination.
   .
   SSPACE is built based on SSAKE. Code of SSAKE is changed to be able to
   extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs for multiple paired reads
   libraries.
   .
   This is the free 'basic' version of SSPACE. The non-free 'standard' version is
   available directly from Baseclear.
version: 2.1.1
