  "sc:description": "It is a novel automated protein functional assignment method based on the neural response algorithm, which simulates the neuronal behavior of the visual cortex in the human brain. The main idea of this algorithm is to define a distance metric that corresponds to the similarity of the subsequences and reflects how the human brain can distinguish between different sequences.",
