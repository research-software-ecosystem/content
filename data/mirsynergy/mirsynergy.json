Existing methods are stochastic or require a fixed number of regulatory modules.Results: We propose Mirsynergy, an efficient deterministic overlapping clustering algorithm adapted from a recently developed framework. Mirsynergy operates in two stages: it first forms MiRMs based on co-occurring microRNA (miRNA) targets and then expands each MiRM by greedily including (excluding) mRNAs into (from) the MiRM to maximize the synergy score, which is a function of miRNA-mRNA and gene-gene interactions. Using expression data for ovarian, breast and thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared Mirsynergy with internal controls and existing methods. Mirsynergy-MiRMs exhibit significantly higher functional enrichment and more coherent miRNA-mRNA expression anti-correlation. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we proposed several prognostically promising MiRMs and envisioned their utility in cancer research.Availability and implementation: Mirsynergy is implemented/available as an R/Bioconductor package at www.cs.utoronto.ca/\u223cyueli/Mirsynergy.html.", "citationCount": 37, "authors": [{"name": "Li Y."}, {"name": "Liang C."}, {"name": "Wong K.-C."}, {"name": "Luo J."}, {"name": "Zhang Z."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yue Li", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yueli@cs.toronto.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mirsynergy", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.10.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Mirsynergy.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-01-10T15:09:28Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Detect synergistic miRNA regulatory modules by overlapping neighbourhood expansion.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~yueli/Mirsynergy.html", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "mirsynergy", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:00:46Z", "name": "Mirsynergy", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Mirsynergy.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
