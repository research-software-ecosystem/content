Existing methods are stochastic or require a fixed number of regulatory modules.Results: We propose Mirsynergy, an efficient deterministic overlapping clustering algorithm adapted from a recently developed framework. Mirsynergy operates in two stages: it first forms MiRMs based on co-occurring microRNA (miRNA) targets and then expands each MiRM by greedily including (excluding) mRNAs into (from) the MiRM to maximize the synergy score, which is a function of miRNA-mRNA and gene-gene interactions. Using expression data for ovarian, breast and thyroid cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we compared Mirsynergy with internal controls and existing methods. Mirsynergy-MiRMs exhibit significantly higher functional enrichment and more coherent miRNA-mRNA expression anti-correlation. Based on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, we proposed several prognostically promising MiRMs and envisioned their utility in cancer research.Availability and implementation: Mirsynergy is implemented/available as an R/Bioconductor package at www.cs.utoronto.ca/∼yueli/Mirsynergy.html.","authors":["Li Y.","Liang C.","Wong K.-C.","Luo J.","Zhang Z."],"cit_count":37,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu373","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24894504","title":"Mirsynergy: Detecting synergistic miRNA regulatory modules by overlapping neighbourhood expansion","type":"Primary","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mirsynergy","biotoolsID":"mirsynergy","description":"Detect synergistic miRNA regulatory modules by overlapping neighbourhood expansion.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Mirsynergy.html","name":"Mirsynergy","version":["1.10.0"]}}
