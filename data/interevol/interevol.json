                "abstract": "Capturing how the structures of interacting partners evolved at their binding interfaces is a fundamental issue for understanding interactomes evolution. In that scope, the InterEvol database was designed for exploring 3D structures of homologous interfaces of protein complexes. For every chain forming a complex in the protein data bank (PDB), close and remote structural interologs were identified providing essential snapshots for studying interfaces evolution. The database provides tools to retrieve and visualize these structures. In addition, pre-computed multiple sequence alignments of most likely interologs retrieved from a wide range of species can be downloaded to enrich the analysis. The database can be queried either directly by pdb code or keyword but also from the sequence of one or two partners. Interologs multiple sequence alignments can also be recomputed online with tailored parameters using the InterEvolAlign facility. Last, an InterEvol PyMol plugin was developed to improve interactive exploration of structures versus sequence alignments at the interfaces of complexes. Based on a series of automatic methods to extract structural and sequence data, the database will be monthly updated. Structures coordinates and sequence alignments can be queried and downloaded from the InterEvol web interface at http://biodev.cea.fr/ interevol/. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.
