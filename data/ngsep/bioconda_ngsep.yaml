description: 'NGSEP provides an object model to enable different kinds of

  analysis of DNA high throughput sequencing (HTS) data. The classic

  use of NGSEP is a reference guided construction and downstream analysis of

  large datasets of genomic variation. NGSEP performs accurate detection and

  genotyping of Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), small and large indels, short

  tandem repeats (STRs), inversions, and Copy Number Variants (CNVs). NGSEP also

  provides utilities for downstream analysis of variation in VCF files, including

  functional annotation of variants, filtering, format conversion, comparison,

  clustering, imputation, introgression analysis and different kinds of

  statistics.
