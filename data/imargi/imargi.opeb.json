However, analyses of chromatin-associated RNAs (caRNAs) are often limited to one caRNA at a time. Here, we describe the iMARGI (in situ mapping of RNA–genome interactome) technique, which is used to discover caRNAs and reveal their respective genomic interaction loci. iMARGI starts with in situ crosslinking and genome fragmentation, followed by converting each proximal RNA–DNA pair into an RNA–linker–DNA chimeric sequence. These chimeric sequences are subsequently converted into a sequencing library suitable for paired-end sequencing. A standardized bioinformatic software package, iMARGI-Docker, is provided to decode the paired-end sequencing data into caRNA–DNA interactions. Compared to its predecessor MARGI (mapping RNA–genome interactions), the number of input cells for iMARGI is 3–5 million (a 100-fold reduction), experimental time is reduced, and clear checkpoints have been established. It takes a few hours a day and a total of 8 d to complete the construction of an iMARGI sequencing library and 1 d to carry out data processing with iMARGI-Docker.","authors":["Wu W.","Yan Z.","Nguyen T.C.","Bouman Chen Z.","Chien S.","Zhong S."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1038/S41596-019-0229-4","journal":"Nature Protocols","pmid":"31619811","title":"Mapping RNA–chromatin interactions by sequencing with iMARGI","year":"2019-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:iMARGI","biotoolsID":"iMARGI","description":"Mapping RNA-chromatin interactions by sequencing with iMARGI.\n\nOverview — iMARGI Pipeline 1.1 documentation.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/ReDU (UCSD.EDU), bio.tools/ICLabel (UCSD.EDU), bio.tools/EpiAlignment (UCSD.EDU), bio.tools/dcell (UCSD.EDU), bio.tools/biolit (UCSD.EDU).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'iMARGI-Docker'","homepage":"https://sysbio.ucsd.edu/imargi_pipeline","name":"iMARGI"}}
