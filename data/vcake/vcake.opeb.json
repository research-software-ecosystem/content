Some of these technologies such as that from Illumina's Solexa Sequencing, produce high genomic coverage by generating a very large number of small reads (∼30 bp). While prior work shows that partial assembly can be performed by k-mer extension in error-free reads, this algorithm is unsuccessful with the sequencing error rates found in practice. We present VCAKE (Verified Consensus Assembly by K-mer Extension), a modification of simple k-mer extension that overcomes error by using high depth coverage. Though it is a simple modification of a previous approach, we show significant improvements in assembly results on simulated and experimental datasets that include error. © 2007 The Author(s).","authors":["Jeck W.R.","Reinhardt J.A.","Baltrus D.A.","Hickenbotham M.T.","Magrini V.","Mardis E.R.","Dangl J.L.","Jones C.D."],"cit_count":160,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"17893086","title":"Extending assembly of short DNA sequences to handle error","year":"2007-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vcake","biotoolsID":"vcake","description":"De novo assembly of short reads with robust error correction.
