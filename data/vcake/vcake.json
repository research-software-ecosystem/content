Some of these technologies such as that from Illumina's Solexa Sequencing, produce high genomic coverage by generating a very large number of small reads (\u223c30 bp). While prior work shows that partial assembly can be performed by k-mer extension in error-free reads, this algorithm is unsuccessful with the sequencing error rates found in practice. We present VCAKE (Verified Consensus Assembly by K-mer Extension), a modification of simple k-mer extension that overcomes error by using high depth coverage. Though it is a simple modification of a previous approach, we show significant improvements in assembly results on simulated and experimental datasets that include error. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 160, "authors": [{"name": "Jeck W.R."}, {"name": "Reinhardt J.A."}, {"name": "Baltrus D.A."}, {"name": "Hickenbotham M.T."}, {"name": "Magrini V."}, {"name": "Mardis E.R."}, {"name": "Dangl J.L."}, {"name": "Jones C.D."}], "date": "2007-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "William Jeck", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "william.jeck@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:vcake", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcake/files/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}, {"term": "k-mer counting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3472"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "De novo assembly of short reads with robust error correction.
