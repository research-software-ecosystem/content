description: GenoSet provides an extension of the RangedSummarizedExperiment class
  with additional API features. This class provides convenient and fast methods for
  working with segmented genomic data. Additionally, GenoSet provides the class RleDataFrame
  which stores runs of data along the genome for multiple samples and provides very
  fast summaries of arbitrary row sets (regions of the genome).
