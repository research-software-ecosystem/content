Mixture models of mutagenetic trees have been used to describe disease progression in cancer and in HIV. In cancer, progression is modeled by the accumulation of chromosomal gains and losses in tumor cells; in HIV, the accumulation of drug resistance-associated mutations in the viral genome is known to be associated with disease progression. From such evolutionary models, genetic progression scores can be derived that assign measures for the disease state to single patients. Rtreemix is an R package for estimating mixture models of evolutionary pathways from observed cross-sectional data and for estimating associated genetic progression scores. The package also provides extended functionality for estimating confidence intervals for estimated model parameters and for evaluating the stability of the estimated evolutionary mixture models. \u00a9 2008 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Bogojeska J."}, {"name": "Alexa A."}, {"name": "Altmann A."}, {"name": "Lengauer T."}, {"name": "Rahnenfuhrer J."}], "date": "2008-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jasmina Bogojeska", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jasmina.bogojeska@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rtreemix", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.36.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rtreemix.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Package that offers an environment for estimating the mutagenetic trees mixture models from cross-sectional data and using them for various predictions.
