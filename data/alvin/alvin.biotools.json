    "description": "Interactive, visual simulation of a spatio-temporal model of gas exchange in the human alveolus.\n\nIn interdisciplinary fields such as systems biology, close collaboration between experimentalists and theorists is crucial for the success of a project. Theoretical modeling in physiology usually describes complex systems with many interdependencies. On one hand, these models have to be grounded on experimental data. On the other hand, experimenters must be able to penetrate the model in its dependencies in order to correctly interpret the results in the physiological context. When theorists and experimenters collaborate, communicating results and ideas is sometimes challenging. We promote interactive, visual simulations as an engaging way to communicate theoretical models in physiology and to thereby advance our understanding of the process of interest",
