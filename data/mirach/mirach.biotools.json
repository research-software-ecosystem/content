In this article we report the release of an efficient model checker MIRACH 1.0, which supports any model written in popular formats such as CSML and SBML. MIRACH is integrated with a Petri-net-based simulation engine, enabling efficient online (on-the-fly) checking. In our experiment, by using Levchenko et al. model, we reveal that timesaving gains by using MIRACH easily surpass 400% compared with its offline-based counterpart. \u00a9 The Author 2011.
