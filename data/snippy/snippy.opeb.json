It will find both substitutions (snps) and insertions/deletions (indels). It will use as many CPUs as you can give it on a single computer (tested to 64 cores). It is designed with speed in mind, and produces a consistent set of output files in a single folder. It can then take a set of Snippy results using the same reference and generate a core SNP alignment (and ultimately a phylogenomic tree).","operation":[{"term":"Phylogenetic tree visualisation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0567"},{"term":"Phylogenetic tree generation","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_0323"},{"term":"Variant calling","uri":"http://edamontology.org/operation_3227"}]}],"labels":{"language":["Python"],"license":"GPL-3.0","operatingSystem":["Linux","Mac"],"toolType":["Command-line tool"],"topic":[{"term":"Genomics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0622"},{"term":"Model organisms","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_0621"},{"term":"DNA polymorphism","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_2885"},{"term":"Phylogenetics","uri":"http://edamontology.org/topic_3293"}]},"link":[{"type":"REPOSITORY","url":"https://github.com/tseemann/snippy/"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snippy","biotoolsID":"snippy","description":"Rapid haploid variant calling and core SNP phylogeny generation.","homepage":"https://github.com/tseemann/snippy","name":"snippy","version":["1"]}}
