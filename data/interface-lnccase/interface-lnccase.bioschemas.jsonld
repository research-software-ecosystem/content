      "sc:description": "Identification and comprehensive characterization of lncRNAs with copy number variations and their driving transcriptional perturbed subpathways reveal functional significance for cancer.\n\nIn recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that aberrant long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) copy number variation may contribute to the onset of human cancers. LncRNAs function in variety of biological pathways and processes. Investigating the functions of lncRNAs are important in uncovering the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. Here we identified lncRNAs related subpathways (sub-regions of pathways) throughout 14 cancer types for characterizing functions of 4115 lncRNAs.",
