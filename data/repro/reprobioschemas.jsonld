  "sc:description": "The web application is able to recognise distant repeats in a single query sequence. The technique relies on a variation of the Smith-Waterman local alignment strategy to find non-overlapping top-scoring local alignments, followed by a graph-based iterative clustering procedure to delineate the repeat set(s) based on consistency of the pairwise top-alignments.",
