Frustration is a useful concept for gaining insight to the proteins biological behavior by analyzing how the energy is distributed in protein structures and how mutations or conformational changes shift the energetics. Sites of high local frustration often indicate biologically important regions involved in binding or allostery. In contrast, minimally frustrated linkages comprise a stable folding core of the molecule that is conserved in conformational changes.
