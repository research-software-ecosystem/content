            "abstract": "© the authors, publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Limited. Alternative splicing is a key regulatory mechanism for gene expression, vital for the proper functioning of eukaryotic cells. Disruption of normal pre-mRNA splicing has the potential to cause and reinforce human disease. Owing to rapid advances in high-throughput technologies, it is now possible to identify novel mRNA isoforms and detect aberrant splicing patterns on a genome scale, across large data sets. Analogous to the genomic types of instability describing cancer genomes (eg, chromosomal instability and microsatellite instability), transcriptome instability (TIN) has recently been proposed as a splicing-related genome-wide characteristic of certain solid cancers. We present the R package TIN, available from Bioconductor, which implements a set of methods for TIN analysis based on exon-level microarray expression profiles. TIN provides tools for estimating aberrant exon usage across samples and for analyzing correlation patterns between TIN and splicing factor expression levels.",

Deviating exon usage is studied in the context of splicing factors to analyse to what degree transcriptome instability is correlated to splicing factor expression. In the transcriptome instability correlation analysis, the data is compared to both random permutations of alternative splicing scores and expression of random gene sets.",
