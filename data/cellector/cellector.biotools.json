                "abstract": "© 2020 The AuthorsCELLector is a computational tool aiding the selection of clinically relevant cancer cell lines in a patient-genomics-guided fashion. CELLector allows selecting cell lines within user-defined contexts, by focusing on biological pathways of interests. It also identifies combinations of molecular alterations underlying disease subtypes lacking representative cell lines, providing guidance for future cancer models’ development. Further, CELLector links patient-genomics data to findings and results from cell-line-based pharmacogenomic screens, allowing in silico prescription of drugs to precisely defined patient segments. © 2020 The AuthorsSelecting appropriate cancer models is a key prerequisite for maximizing translational potential and clinical relevance of in vitro oncology studies. We developed CELLector: an R package and R Shiny application allowing researchers to select the most relevant cancer cell lines in a patient-genomic-guided fashion. CELLector leverages tumor genomics to identify recurrent subtypes with associated genomic signatures. It then evaluates these signatures in cancer cell lines to prioritize their selection. This enables users to choose appropriate in vitro models for inclusion or exclusion in retrospective analyses and future studies. Moreover, this allows bridging outcomes from cancer cell line screens to precisely defined sub-cohorts of primary tumors. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness and applicability of CELLector, showing how it can aid prioritization of in vitro models for future development and unveil patient-derived multivariate prognostic and therapeutic markers.
