description: This package is an implementation the Quantitative Set Analysis for Gene
  Expression (QuSAGE) method described in (Yaari G. et al, Nucl Acids Res, 2013).
  This is a novel Gene Set Enrichment-type test, which is designed to provide a faster,
  more accurate, and easier to understand test for gene expression studies. qusage
  accounts for inter-gene correlations using the Variance Inflation Factor technique
  proposed by Wu et al. (Nucleic Acids Res, 2012). In addition, rather than simply
  evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a single number (a P value),
  qusage quantifies gene set activity with a complete probability density function
  (PDF). From this PDF, P values and confidence intervals can be easily extracted.
  Preserving the PDF also allows for post-hoc analysis (e.g., pair-wise comparisons
  of gene set activity) while maintaining statistical traceability. Finally, while
  qusage is compatible with individual gene statistics from existing methods (e.g.,
  LIMMA), a Welch-based method is implemented that is shown to improve specificity.
