                "abstract": "miRNAs are small non coding RNA structures which play important roles in biological processes. Finding miRNA precursors in genomes is therefore an important task, where computational methods are required. The goal of these methods is to select potential pre-miRNAs which could be validated by experimental methods. With the new generation of sequencing techniques, it is important to have fast algorithms that are able to treat whole genomes in acceptable times. We developed an algorithm based on an original method where an approximation of miRNA hairpins are first searched, before reconstituting the pre-miRNA structure. The approximation step allows a substantial decrease in the number of possibilities and thus the time required for searching. Our method was tested on different genomic sequences, and was compared with CID-miRNA, miRPara and VMir. It gives in almost all cases better sensitivity and selectivity. It is faster than CID-miRNA, miRPara and VMir: it takes \u223c30s to process a 1 MB sequence, when VMir takes 30min, miRPara takes 20h and CID-miRNA takes 55h. We present here a fast ab-initio algorithm for searching for pre-miRNA precursors in genomes, called miRNAFold. miRNAFold is available at http://EvryRNA.ibisc.univ-evry.fr/. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).",
