To aid strategic planning, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute convened key stakeholders at its home university, Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), to survey the local landscape of physician scientists. Surprisingly, few consensus methods were available to measure and benchmark OHSU with respect to national comparators.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'OHSU', 'RGP-holding physician-scientists OHSU', 'physician-scientists', 'physician-scientist workforce'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6798687/","name":"physician-scientists OHSU"}}
