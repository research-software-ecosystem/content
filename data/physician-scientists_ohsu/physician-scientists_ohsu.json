    "description": "A physician-scientist workforce dashboard for biomedical research institutions.\n\nOBJECTIVES SPECIFIC AIMS: A growing concern about the declining physician-scientist workforce prompted the 2014 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Physician Scientist Workforce to recommended that \u201ctools for assessing the strength of the biomedical workforce\u201d be developed. To aid strategic planning, the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute convened key stakeholders at its home university, Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), to survey the local landscape of physician scientists. Surprisingly, few consensus methods were available to measure and benchmark OHSU with respect to national comparators.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'OHSU', 'RGP-holding physician-scientists OHSU', 'physician-scientists', 'physician-scientist workforce'",
