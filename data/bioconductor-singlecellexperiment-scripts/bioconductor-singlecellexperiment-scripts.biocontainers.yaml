description: A set of wrappers for operations associated with the singlecellexperiment
  package. functions in r packages are hard to call when building workflows outside
  of r, so this package adds a set of simple wrappers with robust argument parsing.
  intermediate steps are currently mainly serialized r objects, but the ultimate objective
  is to have language-agnostic intermediate formats allowing composite workflows using
  a variety of software packages.
