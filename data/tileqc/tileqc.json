However, they also present novel analytical challenges that must be met for their effective application to biological questions. Results: Here we report the availability of tileQC, a tile-based quality control system for Solexa data written in the R language. TileQC provides a means of recognizing bias and error in Solexa output by graphically representing data generated by flow cell tiles. The data represented in the images is then made available in the R environment for further analysis and automation of error detection. Conclusion: TileQC offers a highly adaptable and powerful tool for the quality control of Solexa-based DNA sequence data. \u00a9 2008 Dolan and Denver; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 27, "authors": [{"name": "Dolan P.C."}, {"name": "Denver D.R."}], "date": "2008-05-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tileqc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://denverlab.science.oregonstate.edu/tileqc/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequencing quality control", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3218"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-11T18:42:09Z", "otherID": [], "description": "System for tile-based quality control of Solexa data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "tileqc", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:16:52Z", "name": "TileQC", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
