This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.The sharing and re-use of data has become a cornerstone of modern science. Multiple platforms now allow easy publication of datasets. So far, however, platforms for data sharing offer limited functions for distributing and interacting with evolving datasets\u2014 those that continue to grow with time as more records are added, errors fixed, and new data structures are created. In this article, we describe a workflow for maintaining and distributing successive versions of an evolving dataset, allowing users to retrieve and load different versions directly into the R platform. Our workflow utilizes tools and platforms used for development and distribution of successive versions of an open source software program, including version control, GitHub, and semantic versioning, and applies these to the analogous process of developing successive versions of an open source dataset. Moreover, we argue that this model allows for individual research groups to achieve a dynamic and versioned model of data delivery at no cost.",
