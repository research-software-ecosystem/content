Currently, EVAcon is monitoring nine servers, four of which are specialized in contact prediction and five are general structure prediction servers. Results are compared for all newly determined experimental structures deposited into PDB (∼5-50 per week). EVAcon allows for a precise comparison of the results based on a system of common protein subsets and the commonly accepted evaluation criteria that are also used in the corresponding category of the CASP assessment. EVAcon is a new service added to the functionality of the EVA system for the continuous evaluation of protein structure prediction servers. The new service is accesible from any of the three EVA mirrors: PDG (CNB-CSIC, Madrid) (http://www.pdg.cnb.uam.es/ eva/con/index.html); CUBIC (Columbia University, NYC) (http://cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/eva/con/index.html); and Sali Lab (UCSF, San Francisco) (http://eva.compbio.ucsf.edu/~eva/con/index.html). © 2005 University Press.","authors":["Grana O.","Eyrich V.A.","Pazos F.","Rost B.","Valencia A."],"cit_count":14,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15980486","title":"EVAcon: A protein contact prediction evaluation service","year":"2005-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:evacon","biotoolsID":"evacon","description":"Automate the continuous evaluation of inter-residue contact prediction servers.
