      "sc:description": "Metagenomic analysis through the extended Burrows-Wheeler transform.\n\nLiME is a novel lightweight alignment-free and assembly-free framework for metagenomic classification that is combinatorial by nature and allows us to use little internal memory. In [1], a preliminary version of LiME has been introduced together with a new sequence similarity measure based on the properties of the extended Burrows–Wheeler transform. In [2], we now implement two variants of the above similarity measure and improve the overall classification. In addition, the new version of our tool allows to use multiple processors/cores.",
