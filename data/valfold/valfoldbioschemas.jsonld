  "sc:description": "The program is capable of predicting secondary structures with improved accuracy based on unique aptamer characteristics. It predicts not only the canonical Watson-Crick pairs but also G-G pairs derived from G-quadruplex (known structure for many aptamers) using the stem candidate selection algorithm.",
