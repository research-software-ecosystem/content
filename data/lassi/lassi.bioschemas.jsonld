      "sc:description": "A lattice model for simulating phase transitions of multivalent proteins.\n\nMany biomolecular condensates form via spontaneous phase transitions that are driven by multivalent proteins. These molecules are biological instantiations of associative polymers that conform to a so-called stickers-and-spacers architecture. The stickers are protein-protein or protein-RNA interaction motifs and or domains that can form reversible, non-covalent crosslinks with one another. Spacers are interspersed between stickers and their preferential interactions with solvent molecules determine the cooperativity of phase transitions. Here, we report the development of an open source computational engine known as LASSI (LAttice simulation engine for Sticker and Spacer Interactions) that enables the calculation of full phase diagrams for multicomponent systems comprising of coarse-grained representations of multivalent proteins.",
