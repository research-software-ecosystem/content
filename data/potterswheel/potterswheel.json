The program PottersWheel has been developed to provide an intuitive and yet powerful framework for data-based modeling of dynamical systems like biochemical reaction networks. Its key functionality is multi-experiment fitting, where several experimental data sets from different laboratory conditions are fitted simultaneously in order to improve the estimation of unknown model parameters, to check the validity of a given model, and to discriminate competing model hypotheses. New experiments can be designed interactively. Models are either created text-based or using a visual model designer. Dynamically generated and compiled C files provide fast simulation and fitting procedures. Each function can either be accessed using a graphical user interface or via command line, allowing for batch processing within custom Matlab scripts. PottersWheel is designed as a Matlab toolbox, comprises 250,000 lines of Matlab and C code, and is freely available for academic usage at www.potterswheel.de.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Maiwald T."}, {"name": "Eberhardt O."}, {"name": "Blumberg J."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.potterswheel.de/Pages/contact.php", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:potterswheel", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.potterswheel.de/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "MATLAB toolbox for mechanistic mathematical modeling.
