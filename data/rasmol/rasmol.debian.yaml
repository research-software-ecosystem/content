summary: visualization of biological macromolecules
description: >
   RasMol is a molecular graphics program intended for the visualisation of
   proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules. The program is aimed at
   display, teaching and generation of publication quality images.
   .
   The program reads in a molecule coordinate file and interactively displays
   the molecule on the screen in a variety of colour schemes and molecule
   representations. Currently available representations include depth-cued
   wireframes, 'Dreiding' sticks, spacefilling (CPK) spheres, ball and stick,
   solid and strand biomolecular ribbons, atom labels and dot surfaces.
   .
   Supported input file formats include Protein Data Bank (PDB), Tripos
   Associates' Alchemy and Sybyl Mol2 formats, Molecular Design Limited's
   (MDL) Mol file format, Minnesota Supercomputer Center's (MSC) XYZ (XMol)
   format, CHARMm format, CIF format and mmCIF format files.
   .
   This package installs two versions of RasMol, rasmol-gtk has a modern
   GTK-based user interface and rasmol-classic is the version with the old
   Xlib GUI.
version: 2.7.6.0
