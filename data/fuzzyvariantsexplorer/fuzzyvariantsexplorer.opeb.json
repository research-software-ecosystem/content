        "description": "Graded exploration of genomic data and fuzzy queries.\n\nAbstract Summary FuzzyVariantExplorer is a web interface and a fuzzy search system for exploring richly annotated genomes in a flexible way. The application allows combining vague constraints in expressive logical queries to retrieve graded sets of genes and their associated variants. Results can be further refined in a visual way by selecting keywords and categories that are extracted from the underlying annotations and weighted with a statistical significance score; keywords can then be clustered using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and explored visually. The system has been applied to a set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome annotations and a few variants. Availability FuzzyVariantExplorer source code is available at the URL https: bitbucket.org mfalda fuzzyvariantsexplorer src and has been developed in Scala, TypeScript and R. Contact marco.falda@unipd.it.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'FuzzyVariantExplorer'",
