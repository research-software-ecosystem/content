      "sc:description": "Automated analysis program for MVCT quality assurance of helical tomotherapy.\n\nTomoMQA is written in MATLAB and contains three steps for analysis: (a) open the DICOM dataset folder generated via helical tomotherapy (i.e., TomoTherapy® and Radixact™), (b) call the baseline data for the consistency test and click the \"Analysis\" button (or click the \"Analysis\" button without the baseline data and export the results as the baseline data), and (c) print an analyzed report. The overall procedure for the QA analysis included in TomoMQA is referred from the TG-148 recommendation. Here, the tolerances for MVCT QA were implemented from TG-148 recommended values as default; however, it can be modified by a user manually",
