                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s).Efflux proteins are transport proteins, which are involved in transporting different substrates from the cell to the external environment, including antibiotics. The efflux mechanism and efflux pumps are a major reason underlying emerging rampant antibiotic resistance (AR) in microbes. To reduce the resources required and time of identification, characterization and classification of bacterial efflux proteins, we have developed a fast and accurate support vector machine based two-tier prediction system, BacEffluxPred, which can predict bacterial efflux proteins responsible for AR and identify their corresponding families. A leave-one-out cross-validation also called jackknife procedure was used for performance evaluation. The accuracy to discriminate bacterial AR efflux from non-AR efflux was obtained as 85.81% (at tier-I) while accuracies for prediction of efflux pump families like ABC, MFS, RND and MATE family were found 92.13%, 85.39%, 91.01% and 99.44%, respectively (at tier-II). Benchmarking on an independent dataset also showed that BacEffluxPred had comparable accuracy for prediction of bacterial AR efflux pumps and their families. This is the first in-silico tool for predicting bacterial AR efflux proteins and their families and is freely available as both web-server and standalone versions at http://proteininformatics.org/mkumar/baceffluxpred/.",
