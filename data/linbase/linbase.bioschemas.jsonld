      "sc:description": "A Web service for genome-based identification of microbes as members of crowdsourced taxa | Abstract The development of next generation and third generation DNA sequencing technologies in combination with new efficient algorithms allows scientists to economically, quickly, and precisely identify microbes at all taxonomic levels and even attribute pathogen isolates to specific disease outbreaks. However, current taxonomic practice has not kept up with the sequencing revolution and continues to rely on cumbersome journal publications to describe new species. Here we introduce a Web service that allows any user to genomically circumscribe any monophyletic group of bacteria as a taxon and associate with each taxon a name and short description. Any other user can immediately identify their unknown microbe as a member of any of these crowdsourced taxa using gene or genome sequences. The Web service is called LINbase",
