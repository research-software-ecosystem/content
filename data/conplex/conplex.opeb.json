For protein complex structures, sequence conservation has been applied to determine protein oligomerization states, to characterize native interfaces from non-specific crystal contacts, and to discriminate near-native structures from docking artifacts. However, a user-friendly web-based service for evolutionary conservation analysis of protein complexes has not been available. Therefore, we developed ConPlex (http://sbi .postech.ac.kr/ConPlex/) a web application that enables evolutionary conservation analyses of protein interactions within protein quaternary structures. Users provide protein complex structures; ConPlex automatically identifies protein interfaces and carries out evolutionary conservation analyses for the interface regions. Moreover, ConPlex allows the results of the residue-specific conservation analysis to be displayed on the protein complex structure and provides several options to customize the display output to fit each user's needs. We believe that ConPlex offers a convenient platform to analyze protein complex structures based on evolutionary conservation of protein-protein interface residues. © The Author(s) 2010.
