biotools_id: doppelgangr
description: The main function is doppelgangR(), which takes as minimal input a list
  of ExpressionSet object, and searches all list pairs for duplicated samples.  The
  search is based on the genomic data (exprs(eset)), phenotype/clinical data (pData(eset)),
  and "smoking guns" - supposedly unique identifiers found in pData(eset).
