Challenges for the processing of such reads are the accurate identification of the adaptor sequence and accurate reconstruction of the original sequence most likely to have given rise to the observed read(s). We introduce an algorithm that removes the adaptors and reconstructs the original DNA sequences using a Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability approach. Our algorithm is faster, and provides a more accurate reconstruction of the original sequence for both simulated and ancient DNA data sets, than other approaches. leeHom is released under the GPLv3 and is freely available from: https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/leehom/.", "citationCount": 55, "authors": [{"name": "Renaud G."}, {"name": "Stenzel U."}, {"name": "Kelso J."}], "date": "2014-10-13T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/index.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gabriel_renaud@eva.mpg.de"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kelso@eva.mpg.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:leehom", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://bioinf.eva.mpg.de/leehom/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Ancestral reconstruction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3745"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-08-16T09:27:28Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Program for the Bayesian reconstruction of ancient DNA.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/leehom-bayesian-reconstruction-of-ancient-dna-fragments.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "leehom", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:48:22Z", "name": "LeeHom", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/grenaud/leeHom/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
