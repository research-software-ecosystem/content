description: 'NORSnet can distinguish between very long contiguous segments with non-regular
  secondary structure (NORS regions) and well-folded proteins. . NORSnet was trained
  on predicted information rather than on experimental data. This allows NORSnet to
  reach into regions in sequence space that are not covered by specialized disorder
  predictors. One disadvantage of this approach is that it is not optimal for the
  identification of the "average" disordered region. . NORSnet takes the following
  input, further described on norsnet(1): * a protein sequence in a FASTA file * secondary
  structure and solvent accessibility prediction by prof(1) * an HSSP file * flexible/rigid
  residues prediction by profbval(1)'
