However, obtaining information about these interactions with experimental or computational methods remains difficult. The computational tool presented in this article, MoMA-LigPath, is based on a mechanistic representation of the molecular system, considering partial flexibility, and on the application of a robotics-inspired algorithm to explore the conformational space. Such a purely geometric approach, together with the efficiency of the exploration algorithm, enables the simulation of ligand unbinding within short computing time. Ligand unbinding pathways generated by MoMA-LigPath are a first approximation that can provide useful information about protein-ligand interactions. When needed, this approximation can be subsequently refined and analyzed using state-of-the-art energy models and molecular modeling methods. MoMA-LigPath is available at http://moma.laas.fr. The web server is free and open to all users, with no login requirement.","authors":["Devaurs D.","Bouard L.","Vaisset M.","Zanon C.","Al-Bluwi I.","Iehl R.","Simeon T.","Cortes J."],"cit_count":15,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23671332","title":"MoMA-LigPath: a web server to simulate protein-ligand unbinding.","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:moma-ligpath","biotoolsID":"moma-ligpath","description":"Web server for simulating protein-ligand unbinding.
