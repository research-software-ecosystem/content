description: "EncyclopeDIA is library search engine comprised of several algorithms\
  \ for DIA data analysis\nand can search for peptides using either DDA-based spectrum\
  \ libraries or\nDIA-based chromatogram libraries.\nCheck out our manuscript describing\
  \ EncyclopeDIA at Nature Communications (Searle et al, 2018)\nfor more information.\
  \ EncyclopeDIA contains Walnut, an implementation of \nthe PECAN (Ting et al, 2017)\
  \ scoring system, to enable chromatogram library generation\nfrom FASTA protein\
  \ sequence databases when spectrum libraries are unavailable.\n"
