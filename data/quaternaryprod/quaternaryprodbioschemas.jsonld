It is a free alternative to commercial products such as Quiagen and Inginuity pathway analysis. For a given a set of differentially expressed genes, it computes the significance of upstream regulators in the network by performing causal reasoning using the Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic, Ternary Dot product Scoring Statistic and Fisher's exact test.",
