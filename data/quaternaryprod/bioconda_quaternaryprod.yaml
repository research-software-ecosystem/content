description: QuaternaryProd is an R package that performs causal reasoning on biological
  networks, including publicly available networks such as STRINGdb. QuaternaryProd
  is an open-source alternative to commercial products such as Inginuity Pathway Analysis.
  For a given a set of differentially expressed genes, QuaternaryProd computes the
  significance of upstream regulators in the network by performing causal reasoning
  using the Quaternary Dot Product Scoring Statistic (Quaternary Statistic), Ternary
  Dot product Scoring Statistic (Ternary Statistic) and Fisher's exact test (Enrichment
  test). The Quaternary Statistic handles signed, unsigned and ambiguous edges in
  the network. Ambiguity arises when the direction of causality is unknown, or when
  the source node (e.g., a protein) has edges with conflicting signs for the same
  target gene. On the other hand, the Ternary Statistic provides causal reasoning
  using the signed and unambiguous edges only. The Vignette provides more details
  on the Quaternary Statistic and illustrates an example of how to perform causal
  reasoning using STRINGdb.
