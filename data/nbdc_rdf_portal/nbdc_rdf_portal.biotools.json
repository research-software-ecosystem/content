                "abstract": "In the life sciences, researchers increasingly want to access multiple databases in an integrated way. However, different databases currently use different formats and vocabularies, hindering the proper integration of heterogeneous life science data. Adopting the Resource Description Framework (RDF) has the potential to address such issues by improving database interoperability, leading to advances in automatic data processing. Based on this idea, we have advised many Japanese database development groups to expose their databases in RDF. To further promote such activities, we have developed an RDF-based life science dataset repository called the National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) RDF portal. All the datasets in this repository have been reviewed by the NBDC to ensure interoperability and queryability. As of July 2018, the service includes 21 RDF datasets, comprising over 45.5 billion triples. It provides SPARQL endpoints for all datasets, useful metadata and the ability to download RDF files. The NBDC RDF portal can be accessed at https://integbio.jp/rdf/.",
