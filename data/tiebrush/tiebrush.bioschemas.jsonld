      "sc:description": "TieBrush is an efficient method for aggregating and summarizing mapped reads across large datasets. TieBrush is a simple yet efficient method for merging redundant information from multiple alignment files, designed to enable rapid manipulation of extremely large sequencing datasets. The method is specifically designed to optimize investigations of RNA, whole-genome, exome and other types of sequencing experiments. TieBrush preserves much of the original information in a greatly condensed representation as a BAM file, which allows manipulation and extraction of dataset and subset-specific statistics using tools within the package, and which is also compatible with other common utilities.",
