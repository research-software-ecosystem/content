    "description": "Long Term Homogeneity, Trend and Change-Point Analysis of Rainfall in the Arid District of Ananthapuramu, Andhra Pradesh State, India.\n\nDaily rainfall data was collected for the arid district of Ananthapuramu, Andhra Pradesh state, India from 1981 to 2016 at the sub-district level and aggregated to monthly, annual and seasonal rainfall totals and the number of rainy days. The objective of this study is to evaluate the homogeneity, trend, and trend change points in the rainfall data. After quality checks and homogeneity analysis, a total of 27 rain gauge locations were considered for trend analysis. A serial correlation test was applied to all the time series to identify serially independent series. Non-Parametric Mann-Kendall test and Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation tests were applied to serially independent series.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Pre-Whitening', 'Ananthapuramu Andhra Pradesh', 'arid district Ananthapuramu Andhra Pradesh', 'rainfall'",
