The objective of this study is to evaluate the homogeneity, trend, and trend change points in the rainfall data. After quality checks and homogeneity analysis, a total of 27 rain gauge locations were considered for trend analysis. A serial correlation test was applied to all the time series to identify serially independent series. Non-Parametric Mann-Kendall test and Spearman&rsquo;s rank correlation tests were applied to serially independent series.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Pre-Whitening', 'Ananthapuramu Andhra Pradesh', 'arid district Ananthapuramu Andhra Pradesh', 'rainfall'",
