To help reverse this trend, we converted BIND to a standard format, Proteomics Standard Initiative-Molecular Interaction 2.5, starting from the last curated data release (from 2005) available in a custom XML format and made the core components (interactions and complexes) plus additional valuable curated information available for download (http://download.baderlab.org/ BINDTranslation/). Major work during the conversion process was required to update out of date molecule identifiers resulting in a more comprehensive conversion of BIND, by measures including number of species and interactor types covered, than what is currently accessible elsewhere. This work also highlights issues of data modeling, controlled vocabulary adoption and data cleaning that can serve as a general case study on the future compatibility of interaction databases. © The Author(s) 2011.",
