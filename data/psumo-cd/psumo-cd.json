It is critical to many different biological processes such as replicating genome, expressing gene, localizing and stabilizing proteins; unfortunately, it is also involved with many major disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, for both basic research and drug development, it is important to identify the sumoylation sites in proteins. Results: To address such a problem, we developed a predictor called pSumo-CD by incorporating the sequence-coupled information into the general pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) and introducing the covariance discriminant (CD) algorithm, in which a bias-adjustment term, which has the function to automatically adjust the errors caused by the bias due to the imbalance of training data, had been incorporated. Rigorous cross-validations indicated that the new predictor remarkably outperformed the existing state-of-the-art prediction method for the same purpose.", "citationCount": 92, "authors": [{"name": "Jia J."}, {"name": "Zhang L."}, {"name": "Liu Z."}, {"name": "Xiao X."}, {"name": "Chou K.-C."}], "date": "2016-10-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jdzxiaoxuan@163.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:psumo-cd", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pSumo-CD", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predicting sumoylation sites in proteins with covariance discriminant algorithm by incorporating sequence-coupled effects into general PseAAC.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "psumo-cd", "additionDate": "2018-05-19T16:29:29Z", "name": "pSumo-CD", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/pSumo/pSumo_readme.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
