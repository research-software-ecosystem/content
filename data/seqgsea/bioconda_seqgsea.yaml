description: The package generally provides methods for gene set enrichment analysis
  of high-throughput RNA-Seq data by integrating differential expression and splicing.
  It uses negative binomial distribution to model read count data, which accounts
  for sequencing biases and biological variation. Based on permutation tests, statistical
  significance can also be achieved regarding each gene's differential expression
  and splicing, respectively.
