Instructions: Load a bedpe file and a bam file first, set the settings below and in the right-side panel as you want them and click Run!.\n\nMargin around a variant or manually entered coordinate where reads will be pulled from a bam file (use this parameter carefully as importing too much data can crash your web browser due to memory overload).",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: Ribbon is an alignment visualization tool that shows how alignments are positioned within both the reference and read contexts, giving an intuitive view that enables a better understanding of structural variants and the read evidence supporting them. Ribbon was born out of a need to curate complex structural variant calls and determine whether each was well supported by long-read evidence, and it uses the same intuitive visualization method to shed light on contig alignments from genome-to-genome comparisons. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Ribbon is freely available online at http://genomeribbon.com/ and is open-source at https://github.com/marianattestad/ribbon. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
