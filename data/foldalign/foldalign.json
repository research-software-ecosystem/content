The server can be used to scan two sequences for a common structural RNA motif of limited size, or the entire sequences can be aligned locally or globally. The web server offers a graphical interface, which makes it simple to make alignments and manually browse the results.

                "abstract": "Motivation: Searching for non-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes and structural RNA elements (eleRNA) are major challenges in gene finding today as these often are conserved in structure rather than in sequence. Even though the number of available methods is growing, it is still of interest to pairwise detect two genes with low sequence similarity, where the genes are part of a larger genomic region. Results: Here we present such an approach for pairwise local alignment which is based on FOLDALIGN and the Sankoff algorithm for simultaneous structural alignment of multiple sequences. We include the ability to conduct mutual scans of two sequences of arbitrary length while searching for common local structural motifs of some maximum length. This drastically reduces the complexity of the algorithm. The scoring scheme includes structural parameters corresponding to those available for free energy as well as for substitution matrices similar to RIBOSUM. The new FOLDALIGN implementation is tested on a dataset where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs have sequence similarity <40% and where the ncRNAs and eleRNAs are energetically indistinguishable from the surrounding genomic sequence context. The method is tested in two ways: (1) its ability to find the common structure between the genes only and (2) its ability to locate ncRNAs and eleRNAs in a genomic context. In case (1), it makes sense to compare with methods like Dynalign, and the performances are very similar, but FOLDALIGN is substantially faster. The structure prediction performance for a family is typically around 0.7 using Matthews correlation coefficient. In case (2), the algorithm is successful at locating RNA families with an average sensitivity of 0.8 and a positive predictive value of 0.9 using a BLAST-like hit selection scheme. \u00a9 The Author 2005.

Motivation: Structured RNAs can be hard to search for as they often are not well conserved in their primary structure and are local in their genomic or transcriptomic context. Thus, the need for tools which in particular can make local structural alignments of RNAs is only increasing. Results: To meet the demand for both large-scale screens and hands on analysis through web servers, we present a new multithreaded version of Foldalign. We substantially improve execution time while maintaining all previous functionalities, including carrying out local structural alignments of sequences with low similarity. Furthermore, the improvements allow for comparing longer RNAs and increasing the sequence length. For example, lengths in the range 2000-6000 nucleotides improve execution up to a factor of five.",
