                "abstract": "Umami is an important widely-used taste component of food seasoning. Umami peptides are specific structural peptides endowing foods with a favorable umami taste. Laboratory approaches used to identify umami peptides are time-consuming and labor-intensive, which are not feasible for rapid screening. Here, we developed a novel peptide sequence-based umami peptide predictor, namely iUP-BERT, which was based on the deep learning pretrained neural network feature extraction method. After optimization, a single deep representation learning feature encoding method (BERT: bidirectional encoder representations from transformer) in conjugation with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and support vector machine (SVM) methods was adopted for model creation to generate predicted probabilistic scores of potential umami peptides. Further extensive empirical experiments on cross-validation and an independent test showed that iUP-BERT outperformed the existing methods with improvements, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness. Finally, an open-access iUP-BERT web server was built. To our knowledge, this is the first efficient sequence-based umami predictor created based on a single deep-learning pretrained neural network feature extraction method. By predicting umami peptides, iUP-BERT can help in further research to improve the palatability of dietary supplements in the future.",
