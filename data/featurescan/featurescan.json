                "abstract": "We present an implementation of the signal theory-based approach for detection of novel types of DNA similarity which are based on physical properties of DNA. Systematic study of the sensitivity of the new similarity measure revealed qualitative differences to letter-based similarity. A variety of physical parameters of DNA double strands, which in a straightforward way reflect different kinds of information hidden behind the primary structure of DNA, showed a wide range of recognition power of the signal similarity measure. We applied the novel DNA similarity measure for the analysis of promoters of E. coli genes. We found that promoter similarities revealed by our approach correlate with their transcription regulatory responsivenesses to different antibiotic and osmotic treatments. Accelerated by special hardware for fast Fourier transformations, the method is easily applicable for the analysis of entire eukaryotic genomes in minutes. © 2005 - IOS Press and Bioinformation Systems e.V. and the authors.

                "title": "FeatureScan: Revealing property-dependent similarity of nucleotide sequences", 
                "abstract": "FeatureScan is a software package aiming to reveal novel types of DNA sequence similarity by comparing physico-chemical properties. Thirty-eight different parameters of DNA double strands such as charge, melting enthalpy, conformational parameters and the like are provided. As input FeatureScan requires two sequences, a pattern sequence and a target sequence, search conditions are set by selecting a specific DNA parameter and a threshold value. Search results are displayed in FASTA format and directly linked to external genome databases/browsers (ENSEMBL, NCBI, UCSC). An Internet version of FeatureScan is accessible at http://genome.gbf.de/featurescan/. As part of the HOBIT initiative (http://hobit.sourceforge.net/) FeatureScan is also accessible as a web service at its above home page. Currently, several preloaded genomes are provided at this Internet website (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and four strains of Escherichia coli) as target sequences. Standalone executables of FeatureScan are available on request. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
