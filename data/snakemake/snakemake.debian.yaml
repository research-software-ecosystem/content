summary: pythonic workflow management system
description: >
   Build systems like GNU Make are frequently used to create complicated
   workflows, e.g. in bioinformatics. This project aims to reduce the
   complexity of creating workflows by providing a clean and modern domain
   specific language (DSL) in Python style, together with a fast and
   comfortable execution environment.
