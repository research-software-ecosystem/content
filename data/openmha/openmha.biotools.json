The software offers a flexible framework that allows the users to conduct hearing aid research using tools and a number of signal processing plugins provided with the software as well as the implementation of own methods. The openMHA software is independent of a specific hardware and supports Linux, macOS and Windows operating systems as well as 32-bit and 64-bit ARM-based architectures such as used in small portable integrated systems. www.openmha.org",
