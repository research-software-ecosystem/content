Firstly, support vector machine (SVM) modules were developed using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition for predicting oxygen-binding proteins, and achieved maximum accuracy of 85.5% and 87.8%, respectively. Secondly, an SVM module was developed based on amino acid composition, classifying the predicted oxygen-binding proteins into six classes with accuracy of 95.8%, 97.5%, 97.5%, 96.9%, 99.4%, and 96.0% for erythrocruorin, hemerythrin, hemocyanin, hemoglobin, leghemoglobin, and myoglobin proteins, respectively. Finally, an SVM module was developed using dipeptide composition for classifying the oxygen-binding proteins, and achieved maximum accuracy of 96.1%, 98.7%, 98.7%, 85.6%, 99.6%, and 93.3% for the above six classes, respectively. All modules were trained and tested by five-fold cross validation. Based on the above approach, a web server Oxypred was developed for predicting and classifying oxygen-binding proteins (available from http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/oxypred/). \u00a9 2008 Beijing Genomics Institute.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Muthukrishnan S."}, {"name": "Garg A."}, {"name": "Raghava G.P.S."}], "date": "2007-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr Gajendra P.S.
