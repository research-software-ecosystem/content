Firstly, support vector machine (SVM) modules were developed using amino acid composition and dipeptide composition for predicting oxygen-binding proteins, and achieved maximum accuracy of 85.5% and 87.8%, respectively. Secondly, an SVM module was developed based on amino acid composition, classifying the predicted oxygen-binding proteins into six classes with accuracy of 95.8%, 97.5%, 97.5%, 96.9%, 99.4%, and 96.0% for erythrocruorin, hemerythrin, hemocyanin, hemoglobin, leghemoglobin, and myoglobin proteins, respectively. Finally, an SVM module was developed using dipeptide composition for classifying the oxygen-binding proteins, and achieved maximum accuracy of 96.1%, 98.7%, 98.7%, 85.6%, 99.6%, and 93.3% for the above six classes, respectively. All modules were trained and tested by five-fold cross validation. Based on the above approach, a web server Oxypred was developed for predicting and classifying oxygen-binding proteins (available from http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/oxypred/). © 2008 Beijing Genomics Institute.","authors":["Muthukrishnan S.","Garg A.","Raghava G.P.S."],"cit_count":6,"journal":"Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics","pmid":"18267306","title":"Oxypred: Prediction and Classification of Oxygen-Binding Proteins","year":"2007-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:oxypred","biotoolsID":"oxypred","description":"Predict the Oxygen Binding Proteins, Which is carrying Erythrocruorin, Hemoglobin, Myoglobin, Hemerithrin, Leghemoglobin and Hemocyanin.","homepage":"http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/oxypred/","name":"Oxypred"}}
