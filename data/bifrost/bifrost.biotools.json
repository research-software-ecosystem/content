                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s).Memory consumption of de Bruijn graphs is often prohibitive. Most de Bruijn graph-based assemblers reduce the complexity by compacting paths into single vertices, but this is challenging as it requires the uncompacted de Bruijn graph to be available in memory. We present a parallel and memory-efficient algorithm enabling the direct construction of the compacted de Bruijn graph without producing the intermediate uncompacted graph. Bifrost features a broad range of functions, such as indexing, editing, and querying the graph, and includes a graph coloring method that maps each k-mer of the graph to the genomes it occurs in.
