                "abstract": "Background: Bioinformatics and high-throughput technologies such as microarray studies allow the measure of the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously, thus helping us to understand the molecular mechanisms of various biological processes in a cell. Findings: We calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r-value) between probe set signal values from Affymetrix Human Genome Microarray samples and cluster the human genes according to the r-value correlation matrix using the Neighbour Joining (NJ) clustering method. A hyper-geometric distribution is applied on the text annotations of the probe sets to quantify the term overrepresentations. The aim of the tool is the identification of closely correlated genes for a given gene of interest and/or the prediction of its biological function, which is based on the annotations of the respective gene cluster. Conclusion: Human Gene Correlation Analysis (HGCA) is a tool to classify human genes according to their coexpression levels and to identify overrepresented annotation terms in correlated gene groups.

                "abstract": "Gene coexpression analysis constitutes a widely used practice for gene partner identification and gene function prediction, consisting of many intricate procedures. The analysis begins with the collection of primary transcriptomic data and their preprocessing, continues with the calculation of the similarity between genes based on their expression values in the selected sample dataset and results in the construction and visualisation of a gene coexpression network (GCN) and its evaluation using biological term enrichment analysis. As gene coexpression analysis has been studied ex-tensively, we present most parts of the methodology in a clear manner and the reasoning behind the selection of some of the techniques. In this review, we offer a comprehensive and comprehensi-ble account of the steps required for performing a complete gene coexpression analysis in eukary-otic organisms. We comment on the use of RNA‐Seq vs. microarrays, as well as the best practices for GCN construction. Furthermore, we recount the most popular webtools and standalone applications performing gene coexpression analysis, with details on their methods, features and outputs.",

Human Gene Coexpression Analysis 2.0 (HGCA2.0) is a webtool which studies the global coexpression landscape of human genes. The website is based on the hierarchical clustering of 55,431 Homo sapiens genes based on a large-scale coexpression analysis of 3500 GTEx bulk RNA-Seq samples of healthy individuals, which were selected as the best representative samples of each tissue type. HGCA2.0 presents subclades of coexpressed genes to a gene of interest, and performs various built-in gene term enrichment analyses on the coexpressed genes, including gene ontologies, biological pathways, protein families, and diseases, while also being unique in revealing enriched transcription factors driving coexpression. HGCA2.0 has been successful in identifying not only genes with ubiquitous expression patterns, but also tissue-specific genes. Benchmarking showed that HGCA2.0 belongs to the top performing coexpression webtools, as shown by STRING analysis. HGCA2.0 creates working hypotheses for the discovery of gene partners or common biological processes that can be experimentally validated. It offers a simple and intuitive website design and user interface, as well as an API endpoint.",
