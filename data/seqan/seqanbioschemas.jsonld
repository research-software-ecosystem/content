  "sc:description": "An open source C++ library of efficient algorithms and data structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on biological data. Our library applies a unique generic design that guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and integration with other libraries. The library is easy to use and simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss of performance. Additionally, it includes several ready-made command line tools for common tasks in sequence analysis.",
