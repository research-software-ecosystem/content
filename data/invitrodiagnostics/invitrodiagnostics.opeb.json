In NGS-detected genes from cancer patients, driver and passenger mutations can be distinguished. The former provides a proliferative advantage to cancer cells and are commonly found, the latter do not provide proliferative fitness and are different in different patients. However, some passenger mutations might occur in genes involved in metabolism and could be mildly deleterious for cancer cells.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'passenger', 'DrugBank' (bio.tools/drugbank), 'ucm584603.pdf', 'NGS-detected'","homepage":"https://www.fda.gov/downloads/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/invitrodiagnostics/","name":"invitrodiagnostics"}}
