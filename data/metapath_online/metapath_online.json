In this work, the evolution of functional properties of metabolism in relation with metabolic network structure is investigated. The metabolism of ancestral species is inferred from the metabolism of contemporary species using a Bayesian network model for metabolism evolution. Subsequently, these networks are analysed with the recently developed method of network expansion. This method allows for a structural analysis of metabolic networks as well as a quantification of network functions in terms of their synthesising capacities when they are provided with certain external resources. The evolutionary dynamics of one particular network function: the metabolic expansion of glucose is investigated. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2006.",

                "abstract": "A new method for the mathematical analysis of large metabolic networks is presented. Based on the fact that the occurrence of a metabolic reaction generally requires the existence of other reactions providing its substrates, series of metabolic networks are constructed. In each step of the corresponding expansion process those reactions are incorporated whose substrates are made available by the networks of the previous generations. The method is applied to the set of all metabolic reactions included in the KEGG database. Starting with one or more seed compounds, the expansion results in a final network whose compounds define the scope of the seed. Scopes of all metabolic compounds are calculated and it is shown that large parts of cellular metabolism can be considered as the combined scope of simple building blocks. Analyses of various expansion processes reveal crucial metabolites whose incorporation allows for the increase in network complexity. Among these metabolites are common cofactors such as NAD+, ATP, and coenzyme A. We demonstrate that the outcome of network expansion is in general very robust against elimination of single or few reactions. There exist, however, crucial reactions whose elimination results in a dramatic reduction of scope sizes. It is hypothesized that the expansion process displays characteristics of the evolution of metabolism such as the temporal order of the emergence of metabolic pathways. \u00a9 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2005.",

Scopes are defined as sets of metabolites that can be synthesised by a metabolic network when it is provided with given seeds (Sets of initial metabolic compounds). Thus, scopes represent synthesising capacities of the seeds in the network. A hierarchy is discussed in the sense that compounds, which are part of the scope of another compound, possess scopes themselves that are subsets of the former scope. This hierarchy is analysed by means of a directed acyclic graph. Using a simple chemical model, it is found that this hierarchy contains specific structures that can, to a large extent, be explained by the chemical composition of the participating compounds. In this way, it represents a new kind of map of metabolic networks, arranging the metabolic compounds according to their chemical capacity. \u00a9 The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2006.",

Expansion proceeds in consecutive generations in which new reactions are attached to the network produced in the previous stage. Different rules are applied resulting in various modes of expansion. Expansion is performed on the set of glycolytic reactions as well as on a very large set of reactions taken from the KEGG database. It is shown that reactions and compounds strongly differ in the generation in which they are attached to the network allowing conclusions for the temporal order of the acquisition during network evolution.

We measure such functions in terms of the synthesizing capacity of a network when it is provided with a few small chemical substances as external resources. We call this measure the scope and show that it is generally robust against structural alterations of the reaction network. Organisms can be separated into two groups, one with a small and one with a large scope. Networks with a high synthesizing capacity also show a high degree of robustness against structural changes, indicating that this network function has been a target in the evolutionary past of the corresponding organisms. A comparison between structural and functional similarities reveals that organisms with a similar structure do not necessarily show similar biological functions. The presented concepts allow for a systematic investigation of structure-function relationships of metabolic networks and may put forth valuable hints on the evolution of metabolic pathways.",
