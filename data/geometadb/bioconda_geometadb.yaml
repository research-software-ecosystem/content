description: 'The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) represents the largest public
  repository of microarray data. However, finding data of interest can be challenging
  using current tools. GEOmetadb is an attempt to make access to the metadata associated
  with samples, platforms, and datasets much more feasible. This is accomplished by
  parsing all the NCBI GEO metadata into a SQLite database that can be stored and
  queried locally. GEOmetadb is simply a thin wrapper around the SQLite database along
  with associated documentation. Finally, the SQLite database is updated regularly
  as new data is added to GEO and can be downloaded at will for the most up-to-date
  metadata. GEOmetadb paper: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/short/24/23/2798
