We collect 20 sequence alignment algorithms, 10 published and 10 newly developed, which cover all representative sequence- and profile-based alignment approaches. These algorithms are benchmarked on 538 non-redundant proteins for protein fold-recognition on a uniform template library. Results demonstrate dominant advantage of profile-profile based methods, which generate models with average TM-score 26.5% higher than sequence-profile methods and 49.8% higher than sequence-sequence alignment methods. There is no obvious difference in results between methods with profiles generated from PSI-BLAST PSSM matrix and hidden Markov models. Accuracy of profile-profile alignments can be further improved by 9.6% or 21.4% when predicted or native structure features are incorporated. Nevertheless, TM-scores from profile-profile methods including experimental structural features are still 37.1% lower than that from TM-align, demonstrating that the fold-recognition problem cannot be solved solely by improving accuracy of structure feature predictions.", "citationCount": 48, "authors": [{"name": "Yan R."}, {"name": "Xu D."}, {"name": "Yang J."}, {"name": "Walker S."}, {"name": "Zhang Y."}], "date": "2013-09-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Scientific Reports"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:psspred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["v2"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A simple neural network training algorithm for accurate protein secondary structure prediction.
