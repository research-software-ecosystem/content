The implications of synthetic lethal screens have been discussed in the context of drug development as synthetic lethal pairs could be used to selectively kill cancer cells, but leave normal cells relatively unharmed. A challenge is to assess genome-wide experimental data and integrate the results to better understand the underlying biological processes. We propose statistical and computational tools that can be used to find relationships between synthetic lethality and cellular organizational units. Results: In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we identified multi-protein complexes and pairs of multi-protein complexes that share an unusually high number of synthetic genetic interactions. As previously predicted, we found that synthetic lethality can arise from subunits of an essential multi-protein complex or between pairs of multi-protein complexes. Finally, using multi-protein complexes allowed us to take into account the pleiotropic nature of the gene products. Conclusions: Modeling synthetic lethality using current estimates of the yeast interactome is an efficient approach to disentangle some of the complex molecular interactions that drive a cell. Our model in conjunction with applied statistical methods and computational methods provides new tools to better characterize synthetic genetic interactions. \u00a9 2008 Le Meur and Gentleman; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 39, "authors": [{"name": "Le Meur N."}, {"name": "Gentleman R."}], "date": "2008-09-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Nolwenn Le Meur", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "nlemeur@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:slgi", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.34.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SLGI.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-06-27T08:51:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A variety of data files and functions for the analysis of genetic interactions.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "slgi", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:03:53Z", "name": "SLGI", "license": "Artistic-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SLGI.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
