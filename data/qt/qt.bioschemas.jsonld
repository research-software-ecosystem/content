      "sc:description": "Quality Threshold Clustering of Molecular Dynamics | Clustering Molecular Dynamics trajectories is a common analysis that allows grouping together similar conformations. Several algorithms have been designed and optimized to perform this routine task and among them, Quality Threshold (QT) stands as a very attractive option. QT guarantees that in retrieved clusters, no pair of frames will have a similarity value greater than a specified threshold and hence a set of strongly correlated frames is obtained for each cluster. For more information about QT, please refer to Heyer et. al. work (Heyer, L. J.; Kruglyak, S.; Yooseph, S. Exploring Expression Data: Identification and Analysis of Coexpressed Genes. 1999, No. 213, 1106–1115. Genome Research) | Python Implementation of Quality Threshold Clustering for Molecular Dynamics | A python implementation of Heyer, 1999's Quality Threshold clustering algorithm specialized for molecular dynamics trajectories",
