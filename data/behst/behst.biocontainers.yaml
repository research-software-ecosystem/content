description: 'Behst reads an input dataset of chromosome regions, and intersects them
  with the chromatin interactions available in the hi-c dataset. of these chromosome
  regions, behst selects those that are presentthe regulatory regions of genes of
  appris, a dataset of principal isoform annotations. we defined these cis-regulatory
  regions upon the position of their nearest transcription start site of the appris
  genes'' principal transcripts (obtained through gencode), plus an upstream and downstream
  extension. afterwards, behst takes the genes of the resulting partner loci found
  in gene regulatory regions, and performs a gene set enrichment analysis on them
  through g:profiler. behst, finally, outputs the list of the most significant gene
  ontology terms detected by g:profiler. citation: davide chicco, haixin sarah bi,

  through integration of chromatin long-range interactions'', 2018. in preparation.'
