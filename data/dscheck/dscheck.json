Here, we present dsCheck (http://dsCheck.RNAi.jp/), web-based online software for estimating off-target effects caused by the long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) used in RNAi studies. In the biochemical process of RNAi, the long dsRNA is cleaved by Dicer into short-interfering RNA (siRNA) cocktails. The software simulates this process and investigates individual 19 nt substrings of the long dsRNA. Subsequently, the software promptly enumerates a list of potential off-target gene candidates based on the order of off-target effects using its novel algorithm, which significantly improves both the efficiency and the sensitivity of the homology search. The website not only provides a rigorous off-target search to verify previously designed dsRNA sequences but also presents 'off-target minimized' dsRNA design, which is essential for reliable experiments in RNAi-based functional genomics. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 101, "authors": [{"name": "Naito Y."}, {"name": "Yamada T."}, {"name": "Matsumiya T."}, {"name": "Ui-Tei K."}, {"name": "Saigo K."}, {"name": "Morishita S."}], "date": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dscheck", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://dscheck.rnai.jp/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Design", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2430"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-23T09:12:33Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Takes a nucleotide sequence as input and estimates off-target effects caused by dsRNA (double-stranded RNA) employed in RNAi studies.
