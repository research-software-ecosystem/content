Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Two-component systems (TCS) are the main signalling pathways of prokaryotes, and control a wide range of biological phenomena. Their functioning depends on interactions between TCS proteins, the specificity of which is poorly understood. Results: The MetaPred2CS web-server interfaces a sequence-based meta-predictor specifically designed to predict pairing of the histidine kinase and response-regulator proteins forming TCSs. MetaPred2CS integrates six sequence-based methods using a support vector machine classifier and has been intensively tested under different benchmarking conditions: (i) species specific gene sets; (ii) neighbouring versus orphan pairs; and (iii) k-fold cross validation on experimentally validated datasets.","authors":["Kara A.","Vickers M.","Swain M.","Whitworth D.E.","Fernandez-Fuentes N."],"cit_count":0,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"27378293","title":"MetaPred2CS: A sequence-based meta-predictor for protein-protein interactions of prokaryotic two-component system proteins","year":"2016-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metapred2cs","biotoolsID":"metapred2cs","description":"Web server is a meta-predictor based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) that combines 6 individual sequence based protein-protein interaction prediction methods to predict prokaryotic two-component system protein-protein interactions (PPIs).","homepage":"http://metapred2cs.ibers.aber.ac.uk/","name":"MetaPred2CS"}}
