Annotation of succinylation in proteomes is the first-crucial step to decipher physiological roles of succinylation implicated in the pathological processes. In this work, we developed a novel succinylation site online prediction tool, called SuccFind, which is constructed to predict the lysine succinylation sites based on two major categories of characteristics: sequence-derived features and evolutionary-derived information of sequence and via an enhanced feature strategy for further optimizations. The assessment results obtained from cross-validation suggest that SuccFind can provide more instructive guidance for further experimental investigation of protein succinylation.",
