Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Lysine succinylation orchestrates a variety of biological processes. Annotation of succinylation in proteomes is the first-crucial step to decipher physiological roles of succinylation implicated in the pathological processes. In this work, we developed a novel succinylation site online prediction tool, called SuccFind, which is constructed to predict the lysine succinylation sites based on two major categories of characteristics: sequence-derived features and evolutionary-derived information of sequence and via an enhanced feature strategy for further optimizations. The assessment results obtained from cross-validation suggest that SuccFind can provide more instructive guidance for further experimental investigation of protein succinylation.", "citationCount": 23, "authors": [{"name": "Xu H.-D."}, {"name": "Shi S.-P."}, {"name": "Wen P.-P."}, {"name": "Qiu J.-D."}], "date": "2015-06-18T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "HaoDong Xu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "18702528152@163.com"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "JianDing Qiu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jdqiu@ncu.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:succfind", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/SuccFind.aspx", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}, {"term": "Protein feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Novel succinylation site online prediction tool which is constructed to predict the lysine succinylation sites based on two major categories of characteristics: sequence-derived features and evolutionary-derived information of sequence and via an enhanced feature strategy for further optimizations.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/succfind-computational-prediction-of-succinylation-sites-in-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "succfind", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:02:12Z", "name": "SuccFind", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/SuccFind_Help.aspx", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
