EuGène'Hom is able to take into account multiple homologous sequences from more or less closely related organisms. It integrates the results of TBLASTX analysis, splice site and start codon prediction and a robust coding/non-coding probabilistic model which allows EuGène'Hom to handle sequences from a variety of organisms. The current target of EuGène'Hom is plant sequences.","authors":["Foissac S.","Bardou P.","Moisan A.","Cros M.-J.","Schiex T."],"cit_count":27,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"12824408","title":"EUGÈNE'HOM: A generic similarity-based gene finder using multiple homologous sequences","year":"2003-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:eugene_hom","biotoolsID":"eugene_hom","description":"Gene prediction software for eukaryotic organisms based on comparative analysis.
