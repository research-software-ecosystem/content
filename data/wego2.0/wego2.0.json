Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. WEGO (Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot), created in 2006, is a simple but useful tool for visualizing, comparing and plotting GO (Gene Ontology) annotation results. Owing largely to the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing and the increasing acceptance of GO, WEGO has benefitted from outstanding performance regarding the number of users and citations in recent years, which motivated us to update to version 2.0. WEGO uses the GO annotation results as input. Based on GO's standardized DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structured vocabulary system, the number of genes corresponding to each GO ID is calculated and shown in a graphical format. WEGO 2.0 updates have targeted four aspects, aiming to provide a more efficient and up-to-date approach for comparative genomic analyses. First, the number of input files, previously limited to three, is now unlimited, allowing WEGO to analyze multiple datasets. Also added in this version are the reference datasets of nine model species that can be adopted as baselines in genomic comparative analyses. Furthermore, in the analyzing processes each Chi-square test is carried out for multiple datasets instead of every two samples. At last, WEGO 2.0 provides an additional output graph along with the traditional WEGO histogram, displaying the sorted P-values of GO terms and indicating their significant differences. At the same time, WEGO 2.0 features an entirely new user interface.
