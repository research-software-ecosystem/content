description: Tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridization of a long and
  a short rna. the hybridization is performed in a kind of domain mode, ie. the short
  sequence is hybridized to the best fitting part of the long one. the tool is primarily
  meant as a means for microrna target prediction.
