summary: Fast and effective prediction of microRNA/target duplexes
description: >
   RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridisation of a
   long and a short RNA. The hybridisation is performed in a kind of domain mode,
   ie. The short sequence is hybridised to the best fitting part of the long one.
   The tool is primarily meant as a means for microRNA target prediction.
