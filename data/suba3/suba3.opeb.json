More than 14500 new experimental locations have been added since its first release in 2007. Overall, nearly 650 000 new calls of subcellular location for 35388 non-redundant Arabidopsis proteins are included (almost six times the information in the previous SUBA version). A re-designed interface makes the SUBA3 site more intuitive and easier to use than earlier versions and provides powerful options to search for PPIs within the context of cell compartmentation. SUBA3 also includes detailed localization information for reference organelle datasets and incorporates green fluorescent protein (GFP) images for many proteins. To determine as objectively as possible where a particular protein is located, we have developed SUBAcon, a Bayesian approach that incorporates experimental localization and targeting prediction data to best estimate a protein's location in the cell. The probabilities of subcellular location for each protein are provided and displayed as a picto-graphic heat map of a plant cell in SUBA3. © The Author(s) 2012.","authors":["Tanz S.K.","Castleden I.","Hooper C.M.","Vacher M.","Small I.","Millar H.A."],"cit_count":198,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gks1151","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"SUBA3: A database for integrating experimentation and prediction to define the SUBcellular location of proteins in Arabidopsis","type":"Primary","year":"2013-01-01"},{"abstract":"© The Author 2014.

Motivation: Knowing the subcellular location of proteins is critical for understanding their function and developing accurate networks representing eukaryotic biological processes. Many computational tools have been developed to predict proteome-wide subcellular location, and abundant experimental data from green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging or mass spectrometry (MS) are available in the model plant, Arabidopsis. None of these approaches is error-free, and thus, results are often contradictory. Results: To help unify these multiple data sources, we have developed the SUBcellular Arabidopsis consensus (SUBAcon) algorithm, a naive Bayes classifier that integrates 22 computational prediction algorithms, experimental GFP and MS localizations, protein-protein interaction and co-expression data to derive a consensus call and probability. SUBAcon classifies protein location in Arabidopsis more accurately than single predictors.","authors":["Hooper C.M.","Tanz S.K.","Castleden I.R.","Vacher M.A.","Small I.D.","Millar A.H."],"cit_count":74,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu550","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"SUBAcon: A consensus algorithm for unifying the subcellular localization data of the Arabidopsis proteome","type":"Other","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:suba3","biotoolsID":"suba3","description":"A subcellular localisation database for Arabidopsis proteins, with online search interface.","homepage":"http://suba3.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/","name":"SUBA3"}}
