      "sc:description": "TRInc is a comprehensive database for human transcriptional regulatory information of lncRNAs.\n\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to play important roles in transcriptional processes and biological functions. With the increasing study of human diseases and biological processes, information in human H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and DNase-seq datasets is accumulating rapidly, resulting in an urgent need to collect and process data to identify transcriptional regulatory regions of lncRNAs. We therefore developed a comprehensive database for human regulatory information of lncRNAs (TRlnc, http: bio.licpathway.net TRlnc), which aimed to collect available resources of transcriptional regulatory regions of lncRNAs and to annotate and illustrate their potential roles in the regulation of lncRNAs in a cell type-specific manner",
