      "sc:description": "End-to-end Deep Learning using raw Multiple Sequence Alignments | In the last decades, huge efforts have been made in the bioinformatics community to develop machine learning-based methods for the prediction of structural features of proteins in the hope of answering fundamental questions about the way proteins function and their involvement in several illnesses. The recent advent of Deep Learning has renewed the interest in neural networks, with dozens of methods being developed taking advantage of these new architectures. However, most methods are still heavily based pre-processing of the input data, as well as extraction and integration of multiple hand-picked, and manually designed features. Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are the most common source of information in de novo prediction methods. Deep Networks that automatically refine the MSA and extract useful features from it would be immensely powerful",
