                "abstract": "© 2019, The Author(s).In the analysis of clustered or hierarchical data, a variety of statistical techniques can be applied. Most of these techniques have assumptions that are crucial to the validity of their outcome. Mixed models rely on the correct specification of the random effects structure. Generalized estimating equations are most efficient when the working correlation form is chosen correctly and are not feasible when the within-subject variable is non-factorial. Assumptions and limitations of another common approach, ANOVA for repeated measurements, are even more worrisome: listwise deletion when data are missing, the sphericity assumption, inability to model an unevenly spaced time variable and time-varying covariates, and the limitation to normally distributed dependent variables. This paper introduces ClusterBootstrap, an R package for the analysis of hierarchical data using generalized linear models with the cluster bootstrap (GLMCB). Being a bootstrap method, the technique is relatively assumption-free, and it has already been shown to be comparable, if not superior, to GEE in its performance. The paper has three goals. First, GLMCB will be introduced. Second, there will be an empirical example, using the ClusterBootstrap package for a Gaussian and a dichotomous dependent variable. Third, GLMCB will be compared to mixed models in a Monte Carlo experiment. Although GLMCB can be applied to a multitude of hierarchical data forms, this paper discusses it in the context of the analysis of repeated measurements or longitudinal data. It will become clear that the GLMCB is a promising alternative to mixed models and the ClusterBootstrap package an easy-to-use R implementation of the technique.",
