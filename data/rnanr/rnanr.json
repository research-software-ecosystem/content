Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Kinetics is key to understand many phenomena involving RNAs, such as co-transcriptional folding and riboswitches. Exact out-of-equilibrium studies induce extreme computational demands, leading state-of-the-art methods to rely on approximated kinetics landscapes, obtained using sampling strategies that strive to generate the key landmarks of the landscape topology. However, such methods are impeded by a large level of redundancy within sampled sets. Such a redundancy is uninformative, and obfuscates important intermediate states, leading to an incomplete vision of RNA dynamics. Results: We introduce RNANR, a new set of algorithms for the exploration of RNA kinetics landscapes at the secondary structure level. RNANR considers locally optimal structures, a reduced set of RNA conformations, in order to focus its sampling on basins in the kinetic landscape. Along with an exhaustive enumeration, RNANR implements a novel non-redundant stochastic sampling, and offers a rich array of structural parameters. Our tests on both real and random RNAs reveal that RNANR allows to generate more unique structures in a given time than its competitors, and allows a deeper exploration of kinetics landscapes.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Michalik J."}, {"name": "Touzet H."}, {"name": "Ponty Y."}], "date": "2017-07-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yann Ponty", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yann.ponty@lix.polytechnique.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rnanr", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://project.inria.fr/rnalands/software/rnanr/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid folding analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0279"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Exhaustively generate all locally optimal secondary structures of given RNA sequence using Nussinov energy model.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "rnanr", "additionDate": "2018-06-15T13:27:12Z", "name": "RNANR", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/JurMich/RNANR", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
