This method was used to delineate coiled-coil domains in otherwise globular proteins, such as the leucine zipper domains in transcriptional regulators, and to predict regions of discontinuity within coiled-coil structures, such as the hinge region in myosin. More than 200 proteins that probably have coiled-coil domains were identified in GenBank, including \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulins, flagellins, G protein \u03b2 subunits, some bacterial transfer RNA synthetases, and members of the heat shock protein (Hsp70) family.", "citationCount": 3125, "authors": [{"name": "Lupas A."}, {"name": "Van Dyke M."}, {"name": "Stock J."}], "date": "1991-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Science"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Gr\u00e9goire Rossier", "url": "http://embnet.vital-it.ch/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "projects@vital-it.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:coils", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Program that compares a sequence to a database of known parallel two-stranded coiled-coils and derives a similarity score.
