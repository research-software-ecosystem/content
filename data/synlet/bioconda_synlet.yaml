description: Select hits from synthetic lethal RNAi screen data. For example, there
  are two identical celllines except one gene is knocked-down in one cellline. The
  interest is to find genes that lead to stronger lethal effect when they are knocked-down
  further by siRNA. Quality control and various visualisation tools are implemented.
  Four different algorithms could be used to pick up the interesting hits. This package
  is designed based on 384 wells plates, but may apply to other platforms with proper
  configuration.
