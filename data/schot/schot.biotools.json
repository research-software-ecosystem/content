    "description": "Investigating higher-order interactions in single-cell data with scHOT.\n\nSingle cell Higher Order Testing (scHOT) is an R package that facilitates testing changes in higher order structure of gene expression along either a developmental trajectory or across space. scHOT is general and modular in nature, can be run in multiple data contexts such as along a continuous trajectory, between discrete groups, and over spatial orientations; as well as accommodate any higher order measurement such as variability or correlation. scHOT meaningfully adds to first order effect testing, such as differential expression, and provides a framework for interrogating higher order interactions from single cell data.",

Examining cells along a computationally ordered ‘pseudotime’ offers the potential to unpick subtle changes in variability and covariation among key genes. We describe an approach, scHOT—single-cell higher-order testing—which provides a flexible and statistically robust framework for identifying changes in higher-order interactions among genes. scHOT can be applied for cells along a continuous trajectory or across space and accommodates various higher-order measurements including variability or correlation. We demonstrate the use of scHOT by studying coordinated changes in higher-order interactions during embryonic development of the mouse liver. Additionally, scHOT identifies subtle changes in gene–gene correlations across space using spatially resolved transcriptomics data from the mouse olfactory bulb. scHOT meaningfully adds to first-order differential expression testing and provides a framework for interrogating higher-order interactions using single-cell data.",
