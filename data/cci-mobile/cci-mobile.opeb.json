The societal need for assistive hearing devices has increased exponentially over the past two decades; however, actual human performance with such devices has only seen modest gains relative to advancements in digital signal processing (DSP) technology. A major challenge with clinical hearing technologies is the limited ability to run complex signal processing algorithms requiring high computation power.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'UT-Dallas', 'speech', 'hearing', 'software-mediated'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31763625","name":"CCi-MOBILE"}}
