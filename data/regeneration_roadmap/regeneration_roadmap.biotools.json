    "description": "Regeneration Roadmap aims to compile large datasets for gene expression and regulation created by a broad spectrum of high-throughput omics technologies. This one-stop service provides user-friendly functionalities to explore annotated regeneration-related changes in gene expression, as well as raw data downloads from these multi-omics studies. The current implementation includes five modules: Regeneration-related genes, Transcriptomics, Single-cell Transcriptomics, Epigenomics and Pharmacogenomics.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Regeneration plays an instrumental role in biological development and damage repair by constructing and replacing cells, tissues, and organs. Since regenerative capacity declines with age, promoting regeneration is heralded as a potential strategy for delaying aging. On this premise, mechanisms that regulate regeneration have been extensively studied across species and in different tissues. However, an open and comprehensive database collecting and standardizing the abundant data generated in regeneration research, such as high-throughput sequencing data, remains to be developed. In this work, we constructed Regeneration Roadmap to systematically and comprehensively collect such information over 2.38 million data entries across 11 species and 36 tissues, including regeneration-related genes, bulk and single-cell transcriptomics, epigenomics, and pharmacogenomics data. In this database, users can explore regulatory and expression changes of regeneration-associated genes in different species and tissues. Regeneration Roadmap provides the research community with a long-awaited and valuable data resource featuring convenient computing and visualizing tools, which is publicly available at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/regeneration/index.",
