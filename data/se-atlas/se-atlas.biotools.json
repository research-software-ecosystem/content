The website www.se-atlas.de provides an overview of health care providers and support groups focusing on rare diseases in Germany. Since the start of se-atlas in 2013, several strategies are being developed and evaluated. This paper gives an overview about the expectations and visions for se-atlas at the beginning of the project, the challenges and lessons learned within the project period and how se-atlas is implemented today.",
