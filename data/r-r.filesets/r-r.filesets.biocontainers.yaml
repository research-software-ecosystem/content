description: A file set refers to a set of files located in one or more directories
  on the file system. This package provides classes and methods to locate, setup,
  subset, navigate and iterate such sets. The API is designed such that these classes
  can be extended via inheritance to provide a richer API for special file formats.
  Moreover, a specific name format is defined such that filenames and directories
  can be considered to have full names which consists of a name followed by comma-separated
  tags. This adds additional flexibility to identify file sets and individual files.
