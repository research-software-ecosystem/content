                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The AuthorPlant genome sequencing has dramatically increased, and some species even have multiple high-quality reference versions. Demands for clade-specific homology inference and analysis have increased in the pangenomic era. Here we present a novel method, GeneTribe (https://chenym1.github.io/genetribe/), for homology inference among genetically similar genomes that incorporates gene collinearity and shows better performance than traditional sequence-similarity-based methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. The Triticeae tribe is a typical allopolyploid-rich clade with complex species relationships that includes many important crops, such as wheat, barley, and rye. We built Triticeae-GeneTribe (http://wheat.cau.edu.cn/TGT/), a homology database, by integrating 12 Triticeae genomes and 3 outgroup model genomes and implemented versatile analysis and visualization functions. With macrocollinearity analysis, we were able to construct a refined model illustrating the structural rearrangements of the 4A-5A-7B chromosomes in wheat as two major translocation events. With collinearity analysis at both the macro- and microscale, we illustrated the complex evolutionary history of homologs of the wheat vernalization gene Vrn2, which evolved as a combined result of genome translocation, duplication, and polyploidization and gene loss events. Our work provides a useful practice for connecting emerging genome assemblies, with awareness of the extensive polyploidy in plants, and will help researchers efficiently exploit genome sequence resources. \u00a9 2020 The AuthorThis work reports the development of a novel method incorporating collinearity for homology inference among genetically similar genomes, with improved performance and scalability. A comprehensive homology database is built for the tribe Triticeae. With macro- and microcollinearity analysis, the authors proposed a refined model of the chromosome 4A-5A-7B translocations and illustrated the complex evolutionary history of the TaVrn2 homologs.",
