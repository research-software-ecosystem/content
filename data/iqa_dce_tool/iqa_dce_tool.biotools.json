    "description": "The purpose of the tool is to provide a complete framework for automatic detection of image quality for Breast DCE MR images. The assessment is performed on the first post-contrast dynamic phase in order to assess the most clinically relevant sequence among a number of identical acquisitions. Two categories are available for image classification, i.e. high and low quality, depending on the level of noise, degree of blurring and presence of artifacts.",
