                "abstract": "Motivation: Query-based biclustering techniques allow interrogating a gene expression compendium with a given gene or gene list. They do so by searching for genes in the compendium that have a profile close to the average expression profile of the genes in this query-list. As it can often not be guaranteed that the genes in a long query-list will all be mutually coexpressed, it is advisable to use each gene separately as a query. This approach, however, leaves the user with a tedious post-processing of partially redundant biclustering results. The fact that for each query-gene multiple parameter settings need to be tested in order to detect the 'most optimal bicluster size' adds to the redundancy problem. Results: To aid with this post-processing, we developed an ensemble approach to be used in combination with query-based biclustering. The method relies on a specifically designed consensus matrix in which the biclustering outcomes for multiple querygenes and for different possible parameter settings are merged in a statistically robust way. Clustering of this matrix results in distinct, non-redundant consensus biclusters that maximally reflect the information contained within the original query-based biclustering results. The usefulness of the developed approach is illustrated on a biological case study in Escherichia coli. \u00a9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
