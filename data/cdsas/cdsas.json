    "description": "A target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms combined with point-of-care diagnostic test results to support evidence-based decisions during patient consultations by health workers.\n\nHealth workers in low-resource settings often lack the support and tools to follow evidence-based clinical recommendations for diagnosing, treating and managing sick patients. Digital technologies, by combining patient health information and point of care diagnostics with evidence-based clinical protocols, can help improve the quality of care, the rational use of resources (humans, diagnostics and medicines) and save patient lives.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CDSA', 'LMICs', 'evidence-based', 'consultations'",
