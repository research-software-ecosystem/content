Digital technologies, by combining patient health information and point of care diagnostics with evidence-based clinical protocols, can help improve the quality of care, the rational use of resources (humans, diagnostics and medicines) and save patient lives.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CDSA', 'LMICs', 'evidence-based', 'consultations'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/19008433","name":"CDSAs"}}
