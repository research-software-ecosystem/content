    "description": "Ms2 basEd saMple vectOrization (MEMO) is a method allowing a Retention Time (RT) agnostic alignment of metabolomics samples using the fragmentation spectra (MS2) of their consituents. The occurence of MS2 peaks and neutral losses (to the precursor) in each sample is counted and used to generate an MS2 fingerprint of the sample. These fingerprints can in a second stage be aligned to compare different samples.",
