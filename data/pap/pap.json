Although computational approaches have been proposed for this purpose, there is no integrated and user-friendly software application that allows experimental biologists to tackle this problem in higher eukaryotes. We have previously reported a systematic, statistical model of mammalian transcriptional regulatory sequence analysis. We have now made crucial extensions to this model and have developed a comprehensive, user-friendly web application suite termed the Promoter Analysis Pipeline (PAP).

Two important tasks are often encountered when studying transcription regulation, i.e., (1) the identification of common transcriptional regulators of a set of coexpressed genes; (2) the identification of genes that are regulated by one or several transcription factors. In this study, a systematic and statistical approach was taken to accomplish these tasks by establishing an integrated model considering all of the promoters and characterized transcription factors (TFs) in the genome. A promoter analysis pipeline (PAP) was developed to implement this approach. PAP was tested using coregulated gene clusters collected from the literature. In most test cases, PAP identified the transcription regulators of the input genes accurately. When compared with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment data, PAP's predictions are consistent with the experimental observations. When PAP was used to analyze one published expression-profiling data set and two novel coregulated gene sets, PAP was able to generate biologically meaningful hypotheses. Therefore, by taking a systematic approach of considering all promoters and characterized TFs in our model, we were able to make more reliable predictions about the regulation of gene expression in mammalian organisms. \u00a92006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 58, "authors": [{"name": "Chang L.-W."}, {"name": "Nagarajan R."}, {"name": "Magee J.A."}, {"name": "Milbrandt J."}, {"name": "Stormo G.D."}], "date": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pap", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.wustl.edu/webTools/portalModule/PromoterSearch.do", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Transcription factor binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0445"}, {"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}, {"term": "Regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}, {"term": "Promoter prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0440"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Identify potential transcriptional regulators for sets of co-expressed genes and identify potential regulatory targets of transcription factors.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "pap", "additionDate": "2017-02-14T09:34:52Z", "name": "PAP", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
