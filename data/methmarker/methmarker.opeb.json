To confirm the biological or clinical relevance of such changes, gene-specific DNA methylation changes need to be validated in multiple samples. We have developed the MethMarker http://methmarker.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ software to help design robust and cost-efficient DNA methylation assays for six widely used methods. Furthermore, MethMarker implements a bioinformatic workflow for transforming disease-specific differentially methylated genomic regions into robust clinical biomarkers.© 2009 Schüffler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

It also implements a systematic workflow for design, optimization and (computational) validation of DNA methylation biomarkers. This workflow starts from a preselected differentially methylated region (DMR) and results in an optimized DNA methylation assay that is ready to be tested in a large-scale clinical trial.",
