To confirm the biological or clinical relevance of such changes, gene-specific DNA methylation changes need to be validated in multiple samples. We have developed the MethMarker http://methmarker.mpi-inf.mpg.de/ software to help design robust and cost-efficient DNA methylation assays for six widely used methods. Furthermore, MethMarker implements a bioinformatic workflow for transforming disease-specific differentially methylated genomic regions into robust clinical biomarkers.\u00a9 2009 Sch\u00fcffler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 20, "authors": [{"name": "Schuffler P."}, {"name": "Mikeska T."}, {"name": "Waha A."}, {"name": "Lengauer T."}, {"name": "Bock C."}], "date": "2009-10-05T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "MethMarker Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "methmarker@mpi-inf.mpg.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:methmarker", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://methmarker.mpi-inf.mpg.de/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Methylation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3204"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-11T19:18:38Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Design of DNA methylation assays for COBRA, bisulfite SNuPE, bisulfite pyrosequencing, MethyLight and MSP.
