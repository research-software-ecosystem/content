Nucleic Acids Search for Substructures and Motifs (NASSAM) is a graph theoretical program that can search for 3D patterns of base arrangements by representing the bases as pseudo-atoms. The geometric relationship of the pseudo-atoms to each other as a pattern can be represented as a labeled graph where the pseudo-atoms are the graph's nodes while the edges are the inter-pseudo-atomic distances. The input files for NASSAM are PDB formatted 3D coordinates. This web server can be used to identify matches of base arrangement patterns in a query structure to annotated patterns that have been reported in the literature or that have possible functional and structural stabilization implications. The NASSAM program is freely accessible without any login requirement at http://mfrlab.org/grafss/nassam/. © 2012 The Author(s).","authors":["Hamdani H.Y.","Appasamy S.D.","Willett P.","Artymiuk P.J.","Firdaus-Raih M."],"cit_count":10,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22661578","title":"NASSAM: A server to search for and annotate tertiary interactions and motifs in three-dimensional structures of complex RNA molecules","year":"2012-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nassam","biotoolsID":"nassam","description":"The NASSAM webserver searches for 3D patterns in nucleic acid structures.
