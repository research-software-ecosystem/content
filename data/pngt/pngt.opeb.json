PnGT was developed using the Python scripting language and developed the user interface using Tkinter. The software currently calculates 33 physicochemical descriptors along with the sequence length for the given protein primary sequence. The descriptor generated by this tool can be directly utilized as the feature vector for the development of proteomics statistical or machine learning predictive model.","authors":["Vishnoi S.","Garg P.","Arora P."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1111/CBDD.13617","journal":"Chemical Biology and Drug Design","pmid":"31483930","title":"Physicochemical n-Grams Tool: A tool for protein physicochemical descriptor generation via Chou’s 5-step rule","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:PnGT","biotoolsID":"PnGT","description":"PnGT stand for 'Physicochemical n-Grams Tool' | A tool for protein physicochemical descriptor generation | A tool for protein physicochemical descriptor generation | Physicochemical n-Grams Tool (PnGT) Tutorial | Physicochemical n-Grams Tool (PnGT) is an open source standalone software for calculating physicochemical descriptors of protein developed using the Python scripting language | Assessment of the physicochemical n-Grams properties of the protein: With the help of this PnGT tool, the analysis of proteomics data in the term of physicochemical n-Grams statistics is easy-to-do with the only primary sequence as feeding","homepage":"http://14.139.57.41/pngt/home.html","name":"PnGT"}}
