description: LOBSTAHS is a multifunction package for screening, annotation, and putative
  identification of mass spectral features in large, HPLC-MS lipid datasets. In silico
  data for a wide range of lipids, oxidized lipids, and oxylipins can be generated
  from user-supplied structural criteria with a database generation function. LOBSTAHS
  then applies these databases to assign putative compound identities to features
  in any high-mass accuracy dataset that has been processed using xcms and CAMERA.
  Users can then apply a series of orthogonal screening criteria based on adduct ion
  formation patterns, chromatographic retention time, and other properties, to evaluate
  and assign confidence scores to this list of preliminary assignments. During the
  screening routine, LOBSTAHS rejects assignments that do not meet the specified criteria,
  identifies potential isomers and isobars, and assigns a variety of annotation codes
  to assist the user in evaluating the accuracy of each assignment.
