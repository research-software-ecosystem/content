The database currently contains experimentally supported non-interacting protein pairs derived from two distinct sources: by manual curation of literature and by analyzing protein complexes with known 3D structure. It can be used to evaluate protein and domain interactions from new experiments and improve the training of interaction prediction algorithms.",
