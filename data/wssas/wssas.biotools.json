The tool generates sequence annotated by structure (SAS) files, applying structural information derived from structural analyses to a given protein sequence. A World Wide Web interface allows a given sequence to be submitted either for structural annotation or, where its structure is unknown, for search and alignment against sequences of known structure. In both cases, SAS will colour residues in the sequence of known structure according to a selection of properties, including secondary structure, interatomic contacts and active site information. SAS can also be used to inspect properties of a single structure.",
