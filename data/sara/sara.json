However, a characterization and functional classification of the RNA structure and function space have only been partially addressed. Here, we introduce the SARA program for pair-wise alignment of RNA structures as a web server for structure-based RNA function assignment. The SARA server relies on the SARA program, which aligns two RNA structures based on a unit-vector root-mean-square approach. The likely accuracy of the SARA alignments is assessed by three different P-values estimating the statistical significance of the sequence, secondary structure and tertiary structure identity scores, respectively. Our benchmarks, which relied on a set of 419 RNA structures with known SCOR structural class, indicate that at a negative logarithm of mean P-value higher or equal than 2.5, SARA can assign the correct or a similar SCOR class to 81.4% and 95.3% of the benchmark set, respectively. The SARA server is freely accessible via the World Wide Web at http://sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/services/ SARA/.", "citationCount": 27, "authors": [{"name": "Capriotti E."}, {"name": "Marti-Renom M.A."}], "date": "2009-08-04T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sara", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sgu.bioinfo.cipf.es/services/SARA/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pairwise sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0491"}, {"term": "Pairwise structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0503"}, {"term": "Structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0295"}, {"term": "RNA secondary structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0502"}, {"term": "RNA structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2441"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:40Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Based on the homonimous program, this server computes pairwise alignment of RNA structures for structure based assignment of RNA function.
