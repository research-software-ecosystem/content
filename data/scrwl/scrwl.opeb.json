Many such methods have been presented, although only a small number are in widespread use. SCWRL is one such method, and the SCWRL3 program (2003) has remained popular because of its speed, accuracy, and ease-of-use for the purpose of homology modeling. However, higher accuracy at comparable speed is desirable. This has been achieved in a new program SCWRL4 through: (1) a new backbone-dependent rotamer library based on kernel density estimates; (2) averaging over samples of conformations about the positions in the rotamer library; (3) a fast anisotropic hydrogen bonding function; (4) a short-range, soft van der Waals atom-atom interaction potential; (5) fast collision detection using k-discrete oriented polytopes; (6) a tree decomposition algorithm to solve the combinatorial problem; and (7) optimization of all parameters by determining the interaction graph within the crystal environment using symmetry operators of the crystallographic space group. Accuracies as a function of electron density of the side chains demonstrate that side chains with higher electron density are easier to predict than those with low-electron density and presumed conformational disorder. For a testing set of 379 proteins, 86% of χ 1 angles and 75% of χ 1+2 angles are predicted correctly within 408 of the X-ray positions. Among side chains with higher electron density (25-100th percentile), these numbers rise to 89 and 80%. The new program maintains its simple command-line interface, designed for homology modeling, and is now available as a dynamic-linked library for incorporation into other software programs. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","authors":["Krivov G.G.","Shapovalov M.V.","Dunbrack Jr. R.L."],"cit_count":625,"doi":"10.1002/prot.22488","journal":"Proteins: Structure, Function and Bioinformatics","title":"Improved prediction of protein side-chain conformations with SCWRL4","year":"2009-11-25"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:scrwl","biotoolsID":"scrwl","description":"SCWRL4.0 is the most recent version of the SCWRL program for prediction of protein side-chain conformations.
