It allows users to discover, explore and recommend CellML models of interest. This tool is deployed at this address: http://model-discovery-tool.nectar.auckland.ac.nz; as a demonstration of the capabilities described is the paper: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2987-y","homepage":"https://github.com/dewancse/model-discovery-tool","name":"Model_autogenerated"}}
