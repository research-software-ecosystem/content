  "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/elprep | Comparing Ease of Programming in C++, Go, and Java for Implementing a Next-Generation Sequencing Tool | elPrep is an extensible multithreaded software framework for efficiently processing Sequence Alignment Map (SAM) Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files in next-generation sequencing pipelines. Similar to other SAM BAM tools, a key challenge in elPrep is memory management, as such programs need to manipulate large amounts of data. We therefore investigated 3 programming languages with support for assisted or automated memory management for implementing elPrep, namely C++, Go, and Java. We implemented a nontrivial subset of elPrep in all 3 programming languages and compared them by benchmarking their runtime performance and memory use to determine the best language in terms of computational performance",
