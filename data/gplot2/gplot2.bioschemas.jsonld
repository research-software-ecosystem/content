The pathogenesis of IA remains unclear and the treatment limited. The purpose of the present study was to identify the key genes expressed in IAs and provide the basis for further research and treatment. The raw dataset GSE75436 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 15 IA samples and 15 matched superficial temporal artery (STA) samples. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R software. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the DEGs using the gplot2 package in R",
