                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.As immunotherapy is evolving into an essential armamentarium against cancers, numerous translational studies associated with relevant biomarkers, targets, and clinical effects have been reported in recent years. However, a large amount of associated experimental data remains unexplored due to the difficulty in accessibility and utilization. Here, we established a comprehensive high-quality database for cancer immunotherapy called CanImmunother (http://www.biomedical-web.com/cancerit/) through manual curation on 4515 publications. CanImmunother contains 3267 experimentally validated associations between 218 cancer sub-types across 34 body parts and 484 immunotherapies with 642 biomarkers, 108 targets, and 121 control therapies. Each association was manually curated by professional curators, incorporated with valuable annotation and cross references, and assigned with an association score for prioritization. To help clinicians and researchers in identifying and discovering better cancer immunotherapy and their respective biomarkers and targets, CanImmunother offers user-friendly web applications including search, browse, excel table, association prioritization, and network visualization. CanImmunother presents a landscape of experimental cancer immunotherapy association data, serving as a useful resource to improve our insight and to facilitate further discovery of advanced immunotherapy options for cancer patients.",
