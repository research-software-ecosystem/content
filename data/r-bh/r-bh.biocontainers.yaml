description: 'Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries. A large
  part of Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved entirely at compile-time
  without linking.  This  package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost
  libraries  for template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in  this
  package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN  as replication
  of this code in the sources of other packages is  avoided. . As of release 1.60.0-2,
  the following Boost libraries are included: ''algorithm'' ''any'' ''bimap'' ''bind''
  ''circular_buffer'' ''concept'' ''config'' ''container'' ''date''_''time'' ''detail''
  ''dynamic_bitset'' ''exception'' ''filesystem'' ''flyweight'' ''foreach'' ''functional''
  ''fusion'' ''geometry'' ''graph'' ''heap'' ''icl'' ''integer'' ''interprocess''
  ''intrusive'' ''io'' ''iostreams'' ''iterator'' ''math'' ''move'' ''mpl'' ''multiprcecision''
  ''numeric'' ''pending'' ''phoenix'' ''preprocessor'' ''random'' ''range'' ''smart_ptr''
  ''spirit'' ''tuple'' ''type_trains'' ''typeof'' ''unordered'' ''utility'' ''uuid''.'
