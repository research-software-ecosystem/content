This method was used to delineate coiled-coil domains in otherwise globular proteins, such as the leucine zipper domains in transcriptional regulators, and to predict regions of discontinuity within coiled-coil structures, such as the hinge region in myosin. More than 200 proteins that probably have coiled-coil domains were identified in GenBank, including α- and β-tubulins, flagellins, G protein β subunits, some bacterial transfer RNA synthetases, and members of the heat shock protein (Hsp70) family.","authors":["Lupas A.","Van Dyke M.","Stock J."],"cit_count":3126,"doi":"10.1126/science.252.5009.1162","journal":"Science","pmid":"2031185","title":"Predicting coiled coils from protein sequences","type":"Primary","year":"1991-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ncoils","biotoolsID":"ncoils","description":"Prediction of coiled-coil secondary structure elements.","homepage":"http://www.predictprotein.org","name":"ncoils","version":["1"]}}
