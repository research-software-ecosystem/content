Particularly, recent studies have revealed that transcriptomes in many prokaryotes are far more complex than previously thought. Genes in an operon are often alternatively and dynamically transcribed under different conditions, and a large portion of genes and intergenic regions have antisense RNA (asRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts, respectively. Ironically, similar studies have not been conducted in the model bacterium E coli K12, thus it is unknown whether or not the bacterium possesses similar complex transcriptomes. Furthermore, although RNA-seq becomes the major method for analyzing the complexity of prokaryotic transcriptome, it is still a challenging task to accurately assemble full length transcripts using short RNA-seq reads.Results: To fill these gaps, we have profiled the transcriptomes of E. coli K12 under different culture conditions and growth phases using a highly specific directional RNA-seq technique that can capture various types of transcripts in the bacterial cells, combined with a highly accurate and robust algorithm and tool TruHMM (http://bioinfolab.uncc.edu/TruHmm_package/) for assembling full length transcripts. We found that 46.9 ~ 63.4% of expressed operons were utilized in their putative alternative forms, 72.23 ~ 89.54% genes had putative asRNA transcripts and 51.37 ~ 72.74% intergenic regions had putative ncRNA transcripts under different culture conditions and growth phases.Conclusions: As has been demonstrated in many other prokaryotes, E. coli K12 also has a highly complex and dynamic transcriptomes under different culture conditions and growth phases. Such complex and dynamic transcriptomes might play important roles in the physiology of the bacterium. TruHMM is a highly accurate and robust algorithm for assembling full-length transcripts in prokaryotes using directional RNA-seq short reads. \u00a9 2013 Li et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 21, "authors": [{"name": "Li S."}, {"name": "Dong X."}, {"name": "Su Z."}], "date": "2013-07-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://sulab.uncc.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:truhmm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfolab.uncc.edu/TruHmm_package/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Reference based transcriptome assembler for prokaryotes, suitable for assembling transcripts for directional RNA-seq library.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++", "Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/truhmm-trancription-unit-assembly-by-a-hidden-markov-model.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "truhmm", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:13:52Z", "name": "TruHmm", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows"]}
