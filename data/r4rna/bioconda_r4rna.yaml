description: A package for RNA basepair analysis, including the visualization of basepairs
  as arc diagrams for easy comparison and annotation of sequence and structure.  Arc
  diagrams can additionally be projected onto multiple sequence alignments to assess
  basepair conservation and covariation, with numerical methods for computing statistics
  for each.
