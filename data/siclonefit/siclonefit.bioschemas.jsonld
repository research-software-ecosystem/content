      "sc:description": "Bayesian inference of population structure, genotype, and phylogeny of tumor clones from single-cell genome sequencing data.\n\nAccumulation and selection of somatic mutations in a Darwinian framework result in intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) that poses significant challenges to the diagnosis and clinical therapy of cancer. Identification of the tumor cell populations (clones) and reconstruction of their evolutionary relationship can elucidate this heterogeneity. Recently developed single-cell DNA sequencing (SCS) technologies promise to resolve ITH to a single-cell level. However, technical errors in SCS data sets, including false-positives (FP) and false-negatives (FN) due to allelic dropout, and cell doublets, significantly complicate these tasks. Here, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian method that reconstructs the clonal populations as clusters of single cells, genotypes of each clone, and the evolutionary relationship between the clones",
