      "sc:description": "A flexible pipeline characterizing protein binding to local RNA structure.\n\nnearBynding is an R package that discerns RNA structure at and proximal to the site of protein binding within regions of the transcriptome defined by the user. Input CLIP protein-binding data can either be in aligned BAM or peak-called BED/bedGraph formats. RNA structure can either be internally calculated via CapR or can be provided by the user as a BED/bedGraph. RNA structure binding profiles can be visually and mathematically compared between proteins across multiple formats.",
