    "description": "Spacedust is a modular toolkit for identification of conserved gene clusters among multiple genomes based on homology and conservation of gene neighborhood. Spacedust adapts the fast and sensitive structure comparisons of Foldseek and homology search capabilities of MMseqs2. It introduces a novel approach of aggregating sets of homologous hits between pairs of genomes and identifies cluster of hits with conserved gene neighborhood between each using agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm.",
