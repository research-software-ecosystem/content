      "sc:description": "Allele Min-Set Cover Software.\n\nTo facilitate reference-material selection for clinical genetic testing laboratories, we developed VarCover, open-source software hosted on GitHub, which accepts a file of variants (rsIDs or VCF) and returns an approximately minimal set of samples covering the targeted alleles. VarCover employs the SetCoverPy package, sample weights, and preselection of singleton-possessing samples to efficiently solve the min-set cover problem. As a test case, we attempted to find a minimal set of reference samples from the 1000 Genomes Project to cover 237 variants considered putatively pathogenic (of which 12 were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic) in the original 56 medically actionable genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The number of samples, number of alleles, and processing time were measured in subsets of the 237 target alleles.",
