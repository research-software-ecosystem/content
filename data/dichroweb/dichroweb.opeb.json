The server is located at http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb and may be accessed via a password-limited user ID, available upon completion of a registration form. The server facilitates analyses using five popular algorithms and (currently) seven different reference databases by accepting data in a user-friendly manner in a wide range of formats, including those output by both commercial CD instruments and synchrotron radiation-based circular dichroism beamlines, as well as those produced by spectral processing software packages. It produces as output calculated secondary structures, a goodness-of-fit parameter for the analyses, and tabular and graphical displays of experimental, calculated and difference spectra. The web pages associated with the server provide information on CD spectroscopic methods and terms, literature references and aids for interpreting the analysis result. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Whitmore L.","Wallace B.A."],"cit_count":1528,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15215473","title":"DICHROWEB, an online server for protein secondary structure analyses from circular dichroism spectroscopic data","year":"2004-07-01"},{"pmid":"11836237"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dichroweb","biotoolsID":"dichroweb","description":"A server that supports several different algorithms for the analysis of Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra for the prediction of protein secondary structure.
