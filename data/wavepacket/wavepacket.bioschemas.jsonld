      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Matlab package for numerical quantum dynamics. III. Quantum-classical simulations and surface hopping trajectories | WavePacket is an open-source program package for numerical simulations in quantum dynamics. Building on the previous Part I (Schmidt and Lorenz, Comput. Phys. Commun. 2017, 213, 223] and Part II (Schmidt and Hartmann, Comput. Phys. Commun. 2018, 228, 229] which dealt with quantum dynamics of closed and open systems, respectively, the present Part III adds fully classical and mixed quantum-classical propagation techniques to WavePacket. There classical phase-space densities are sampled by trajectories which follow (diabatic or adiabatic) potential energy surfaces. In the vicinity of (genuine or avoided) intersections of those surfaces, trajectories may switch between them",
