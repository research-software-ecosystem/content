Building on the previous Part I (Schmidt and Lorenz, Comput. Phys. Commun. 2017, 213, 223] and Part II (Schmidt and Hartmann, Comput. Phys. Commun. 2018, 228, 229] which dealt with quantum dynamics of closed and open systems, respectively, the present Part III adds fully classical and mixed quantum-classical propagation techniques to WavePacket. There classical phase-space densities are sampled by trajectories which follow (diabatic or adiabatic) potential energy surfaces. In the vicinity of (genuine or avoided) intersections of those surfaces, trajectories may switch between them. To model these transitions, two classes of stochastic algorithms have been implemented: (1) Tully's fewest switches surface hopping and (2) Landau\u2013Zener-based single switch surface hopping. The latter one offers the advantage of being based on adiabatic energy gaps only, thus not requiring nonadiabatic coupling information any more. The present work describes the MATLAB version of WavePacket 6.1.0, which is essentially an object-oriented rewrite of previous versions, allowing to perform fully classical, quantum-classical and quantum-mechanical simulations on an equal footing, that is, for the same physical system described by the same WavePacket input. The software package is hosted and further developed at the Sourceforge platform, where also extensive Wiki-documentation as well as numerous worked-out demonstration examples with animated graphics are available. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
