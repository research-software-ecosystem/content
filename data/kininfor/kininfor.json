Using information-theoretic principles, I introduce the informativeness for relationship (IR) and the informativeness for relatedness (Ir) to measure the amount of information provided by markers in inferring pairwise relationships (R) and relatedness (r), respectively. I also propose a fast and accurate algorithm to calculate the power (PWR) of a set of markers in differentiating two candidate relationships, and the reciprocal of the mean squared deviations of relatedness estimates (RMSD) to measure the amount of information of markers actually used by an estimator in estimating relatedness. All of the four measurements (IR, Ir, PWR, RMSD) apply to dominant and codominant markers, haploid and diploid individuals, and take into account of mutations and typing errors in data. The statistical properties of the four measurements and their relationships are investigated analytically and are examined by applying these methods to simulated and empirical data. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Inc.
