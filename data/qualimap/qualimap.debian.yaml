  description: evaluating next generation sequencing alignment data
  long_description: " Qualimap 2 provides both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and
    a\n command-line interface to facilitate the quality control of alignment\n sequencing
    data and its derivatives like feature counts.\n .\n Supported types of experiments
    include:\n  * Whole-genome sequencing\n  * Whole-exome sequencing\n  * RNA-seq
    (speical mode available)\n  * ChIP-seq\n .\n Qualimap examines sequencing alignment
    data in SAM/BAM files according\n to the features of the mapped reads and provides
    an overall view of the\n data that helps to the detect biases in the sequencing
    and/or mapping of\n the data and eases decision-making for further analysis.\n\
    \ .\n Qualimap provides multi-sample comparison of alignment and counts data.\n\
    \  * Fast analysis accross the reference of genome coverage and nucleotide\n \
    \   distribution;\n  * Easy to interpret summary of the main properties of the\n\
    \    alignment data;\n  * Analysis of the reads mapped inside/outside of the regions
    provided\n    in GFF format;\n  * Computation and analysis of read counts obtained
    from intersectition\n    of read alignments with genomic features;\n  * Analysis
    of the adequasy of the sequencing depth in RNA-seq\n    experiments;\n  * Multi-sample
    comparison of alignment and counts data;\n  * Clustering of epigenomic profiles."
