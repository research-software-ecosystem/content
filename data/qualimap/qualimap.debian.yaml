description: 'Qualimap 2 provides both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a command-line
  interface to facilitate the quality control of alignment sequencing data and its
  derivatives like feature counts. . Supported types of experiments include: * Whole-genome
  sequencing * Whole-exome sequencing * RNA-seq (speical mode available) * ChIP-seq
  . Qualimap examines sequencing alignment data in SAM/BAM files according to the
  features of the mapped reads and provides an overall view of the data that helps
  to the detect biases in the sequencing and/or mapping of the data and eases decision-making
  for further analysis. . Qualimap provides multi-sample comparison of alignment and
  counts data. * Fast analysis accross the reference of genome coverage and nucleotide
  distribution; * Easy to interpret summary of the main properties of the alignment
  data; * Analysis of the reads mapped inside/outside of the regions provided in GFF
  format; * Computation and analysis of read counts obtained from intersectition of
  read alignments with genomic features; * Analysis of the adequasy of the sequencing
  depth in RNA-seq experiments; * Multi-sample comparison of alignment and counts
  data; * Clustering of epigenomic profiles.'
