                "abstract": "Genome Surveyor 2.0 is a web-based tool for discovery and analysis of cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila, built on top of the GBrowse genome browser for convenient visualization. Genome Surveyor was developed as a tool for predicting transcription factor (TF) binding targets and cis-regulatory modules (CRMs/enhancers), based on motifs representing experimentally determined DNA binding specificities. Since its first publication, we have added substantial new functionality (e.g. phylogenetic averaging of motif scores from multiple species, and a novel CRM discovery technique), increased the number of supported motifs about 4-fold (from \u223c100 to \u223c400), added provisions for evolutionary comparison across many more Drosophila species (from 2 to 12), and improved the user-interface. The server is free and open to all users, and there is no login requirement. Address: http://veda.cs.uiuc.edu/gs. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).",
