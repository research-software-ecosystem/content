                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.Here we present SVScore, a tool for in silico structural variation (SV) impact prediction. SVScore aggregates per-base single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) pathogenicity scores across relevant genomic intervals for each SV in a manner that considers variant type, gene features and positional uncertainty. We show that the allele frequency spectrum of high-scoring SVs is strongly skewed toward lower frequencies, suggesting that they are under purifying selection, and that SVScore identifies deleterious variants more effectively than alternative methods. Notably, our results also suggest that duplications are under surprisingly strong selection relative to deletions, and that there are a similar number of strongly pathogenic SVs and SNPs in the human population. Availability and Implementation: SVScore is implemented in Perl and available freely at {{http:// www.github.com/lganel/SVScore}} for use under the MIT license.",
