                "abstract": "Copyright © 2021 Wang, Ma and Wang.Identifying the protein complexes in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks is essential for understanding cellular organization and biological processes. To address the high false positive/negative rates of PPI networks and detect protein complexes with multiple topological structures, we developed a novel improved memetic algorithm (IMA). IMA first combines the topological and biological properties to obtain a weighted PPI network with reduced noise. Next, it integrates various clustering results to construct the initial populations. Furthermore, a fitness function is designed based on the five topological properties of the protein complexes. Finally, we describe the rest of our IMA method, which primarily consists of four steps: selection operator, recombination operator, local optimization strategy, and updating the population operator. In particular, IMA is a combination of genetic algorithm and a local optimization strategy, which has a strong global search ability, and searches for local optimal solutions effectively. The experimental results demonstrate that IMA performs much better than the base methods and existing state-of-the-art techniques. The source code and datasets of the IMA can be found at https://github.com/RongquanWang/IMA.",
