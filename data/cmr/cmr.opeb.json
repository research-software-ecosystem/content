The Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) contains robust annotation of all complete microbial genomes and allows for a wide variety of data retrievals. The bacterial information has been placed on the Web at http://www.tigr.org/CMR for retrieval using standard web browsing technology. Retrievals can be based on protein properties such as molecular weight or hydrophobicity, GC-content, functional role assignments and taxonomy. The CMR also has special web-based tools to allow data mining using pre-run homology searches, whole genome dot-plots, batch downloading and traversal across genomes using a variety of datatypes.","authors":["Peterson J.D.","Umayam L.A.","Dickinson T.","Hickey E.K.","White O."],"cit_count":360,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"11125067","title":"The comprehensive microbial resource","year":"2001-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cmr","biotoolsID":"cmr","description":"The Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) gives access to a central repository of the sequence and annotation of all complete public prokaryotic genomes as well as comparative genomics tools across all of the genomes in the database.","homepage":"http://cmr.tigr.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi","name":"CMR"}}
