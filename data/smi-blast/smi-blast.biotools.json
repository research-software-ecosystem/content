    "description": "a novel supervised search framework based on PSI-BLAST for protein remote homology detection.\n\nThe Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) finds regions of local similarity between sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance of matches. BLAST can be used to infer functional and evolutionary relationships between sequences as well as help identify members of gene families.\n\nBLAST finds regions of similarity between biological sequences.\n\nResults: To uncover the reasons, we figured out three types of Incorrectly Selected Homology (ISH) errors in PSSMs.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: As one of the most important and widely used mainstream iterative search tool for protein sequence search, an accurate Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) is the key of PSI-BLAST. However, PSSMs containing non-homologous information obviously reduce the performance of PSI-BLAST for protein remote homology. Results: To further study this problem, we summarize three types of Incorrectly Selected Homology (ISH) errors in PSSMs. A new search tool Supervised-Manner-based Iterative BLAST (SMI-BLAST) is proposed based on PSI-BLAST for solving these errors. SMI-BLAST obviously outperforms PSI-BLAST on the Structural Classification of Proteins-extended (SCOPe) dataset. Compared with PSI-BLAST on the ISH error subsets of SCOPe dataset, SMI-BLAST detects 1.6-2.87 folds more remote homologous sequences, and outperforms PSI-BLAST by 35.66% in terms of ROC1 scores. Furthermore, this framework is applied to JackHMMER, DELTA-BLAST and PSI-BLASTexB, and their performance is further improved.",
