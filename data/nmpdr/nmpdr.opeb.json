NMPDR contains the complete genomes of ∼50 strains of pathogenic bacteria that are the focus of our curators, as well as >400 other genomes that provide a broad context for comparative analysis across the three phylogenetic Domains. NMPDR integrates complete, public genomes with expertly curated biological subsystems to provide the most consistent genome annotations. Subsystems are sets of functional roles related by a biologically meaningful organizing principle, which are built over large collections of genomes; they provide researchers with consistent functional assignments in a biologically structured context. Investigators can browse subsystems and reactions to develop accurate reconstructions of the metabolic networks of any sequenced organism. NMPDR provides a comprehensive bioinformatics platform, with tools and viewers for genome analysis. Results of precomputed gene clustering analyses can be retrieved in tabular or graphic format with one-click tools. NMPDR tools include Signature Genes, which finds the set of genes in common or that differentiates two groups of organisms. Essentiality data collated from genome-wide studies have been curated. Drug target identification and high-throughput, in silico, compound screening are in development. © 2007 Oxford University Press.","authors":["McNeil L.K.","Reich C.","Aziz R.K.","Bartels D.","Cohoon M.","Disz T.","Edwards R.A.","Gerdes S.","Hwang K.","Kubal M.","Margaryan G.R.","Meyer F.","Mihalo W.","Olsen G.J.","Olson R.","Osterman A.","Paarmann D.","Paczian T.","Parrello B.","Pusch G.D.","Rodionov D.A.","Shi X.","Vassieva O.","Vonstein V.","Zagnitko O.","Xia F.","Zinner J.","Overbeek R.","Stevens R."],"cit_count":73,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkl947","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"The National Microbial Pathogen Database Resource (NMPDR): A genomics platform based on subsystem annotation","type":"Primary","year":"2007-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nmpdr","biotoolsID":"nmpdr","description":"Curated annotations in an environment for comparative analysis of genomes and biological subsystems, with an emphasis on the food-borne pathogens Campylobacter, Listeria, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Vibrio as well as the STD pathogens Chlamydiaceae, Haemophilus, Mycoplasma, Neisseria, Treponema, and Ureaplasma.","homepage":"http://www.nmpdr.org","name":"National microbial pathogen"}}
