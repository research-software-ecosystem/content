                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)In-depth analysis of viral vectors is a key component in assessment of safety and efficacy of gene therapy. Afzal et al. describes a computational platform to deepen the understanding of viral vectors in pre-clinical and clinical gene therapy data, as well as dissecting the contaminants in viral preparations. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)Viral vector characterization and analysis are important components for the development of safe gene therapeutic products, elucidating the potential genotoxic and immunogenic effects of vectors and establishing their safety profiles. Here, we present VSeq-Toolkit, which offers varying analysis modes for viral gene therapy data. The first mode determines the undesirable known contaminants and their frequency in viral preparations or other sequencing data. The second mode is designed for the analysis of intra-vector fusion breakpoints and the third mode for unraveling the viral-host fusion events distribution. Analysis modes of our toolkit can be executed independently or together and allow the analysis of multiple viral vectors concurrently. It has been designed and evaluated for the analysis of short read high-throughput sequencing data, including whole-genome or targeted sequencing. VSeq-Toolkit is developed in Perl and Bash programming languages and is available at https://github.com/CompMeth/VSeq-Toolkit.",
