description: "Compute MinHash signatures for nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein sequences.\
  \ . MinHash sketches provide a lightweight way to store \u201Csignatures\u201D of\
  \ large DNA or RNA sequence collections, and then compare or search them using a\
  \ Jaccard index. MinHash sketches can be used to identify samples, find similar\
  \ samples, identify data sets with shared sequences, and build phylogenetic trees\
  \ (Ondov et al. 2015). . sourmash provides a command line script, a Python library,\
  \ and a CPython module for MinHash sketches"
