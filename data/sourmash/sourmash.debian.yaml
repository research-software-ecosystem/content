  description: tools for comparing DNA sequences with MinHash sketches
  long_description: " Compute MinHash signatures for nucleotide (DNA/RNA) and protein
    sequences.\n .\n MinHash sketches provide a lightweight way to store “signatures”
    of large DNA\n or RNA sequence collections, and then compare or search them using
    a Jaccard\n index. MinHash sketches can be used to identify samples, find similar
    samples,\n identify data sets with shared sequences, and build phylogenetic trees\n
    (Ondov et al. 2015).\n .\n sourmash provides a command line script, a Python library,
    and a CPython\n module for MinHash sketches"
