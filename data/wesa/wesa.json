                "abstract": "Residues that form the hydrophobic core of a protein are critical for its stability. A number of approaches have been developed to classify residues as buried or exposed. In order to optimize the classification, we have refined a suite of five methods over a large dataset and proposed a metamethod based on an ensemble average of the individual methods, leading to a two-state classification accuracy of 80%. Many studies have suggested that hydrophobic core residues are likely sites of deleterious mutations, so we wanted to see to what extent these sites can be predicted from the putative buried residues. Residues that were most confidently classified as buried were proposed as sites of deleterious mutations. This proposition was tested on six proteins for which sites of deleterious mutations have previously been identified by stability measurement or functional assay. Of the total of 130 residues predicted as sites of deleterious mutations, 104 (or 80%) were correct. \u00a9 The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
