description: Mothur seeks to develop a single piece of open-source, expandable software
  to fill the bioinformatics needs of the microbial ecology community. It has incorporated
  the functionality of dotur, sons, treeclimber, s-libshuff, unifrac, and much more.
  In addition to improving the flexibility of these algorithms, a number of other
  features including calculators and visualization tools were added.
