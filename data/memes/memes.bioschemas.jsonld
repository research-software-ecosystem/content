      "sc:description": "memes is an R interface to the MEME Suite family of tools, which provides several utilities for performing motif analysis on DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. memes works by detecting a local install of the MEME suite, running the commands, then importing the results directly into R.\n\nA docker container for motif analysis in R using the memes packge. Currently, this container is build from the development branch of bioconductor_docker_meme, which builds a bioconductor docker image + the most current MEME Suite version. This container additionally contains an install of the most recent {memes} package along with all dependencies. It can be used to test out {memes} or to perform containerized data analysis.\n\nThis repository contains all analysis code associated with the paper 'Memes: an R interface to the MEME Suite'.\n\nmotif matching, comparison, and de novo discovery using the MEME Suite.",
