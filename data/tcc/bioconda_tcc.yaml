description: This package provides a series of functions for performing differential
  expression analysis from RNA-seq count data using robust normalization strategy
  (called DEGES). The basic idea of DEGES is that potential differentially expressed
  genes or transcripts (DEGs) among compared samples should be removed before data
  normalization to obtain a well-ranked gene list where true DEGs are top-ranked and
  non-DEGs are bottom ranked. This can be done by performing a multi-step normalization
  strategy (called DEGES for DEG elimination strategy). A major characteristic of
  TCC is to provide the robust normalization methods for several kinds of count data
  (two-group with or without replicates, multi-group/multi-factor, and so on) by virtue
  of the use of combinations of functions in depended packages.
