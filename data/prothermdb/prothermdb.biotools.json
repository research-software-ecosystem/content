    "description": "ProThermDB, thermodynamic Database for Proteins and Mutants (ProThermDB) contains more than 32,000 data of several thermodynamic parameters such as melting temperature, free energy obtained with thermal and denaturant denaturation, enthalpy change, and heat capacity change along with experimental methods and conditions, sequence, structure, and literature information. Besides, the current version of the database includes ~0.12 million thermodynamic data obtained for different organisms and cell lines, which are determined by recent high throughput proteomics techniques using whole-cell approaches. In addition, we provided a graphical interface for the visualization of mutations at sequence and structure levels. ProThermDB is cross-linked with other relevant databases, PDB, UniProt, PubMed, etc.",

It contains several thermodynamic parameters such as melting temperature, free energy obtained with thermal and denaturant denaturation, enthalpy change and heat capacity change along with experimental methods and conditions, sequence, structure and literature information. Besides, the current version of the database includes about 120 000 thermodynamic data obtained for different organisms and cell lines, which are determined by recent high throughput proteomics techniques using whole-cell approaches. In addition, we provided a graphical interface for visualization of mutations at sequence and structure levels.
