    "description": "New Software for Viewing Dynamic PET Scans and Extracting Radiomic Parameters from PET Data | Extensive research is currently being conducted into dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) acquisitions (including dynamic whole-body imaging) as well as extraction of radiomic features from imaging modalities. We describe a new PET viewing software known as Imager-4D that provides a facile means of viewing and analyzing dynamic PET data and obtaining associated quantitative metrics including radiomic parameters. The Imager-4D was programmed in the Java language utilizing the FX extensions. It is executable on any system for which a Java w FX compliant virtual machine is available. The software incorporates the ability to view and analyze dynamic data acquired with different types of dynamic protocols. For image display, the program maintains a built-in library of 62 different lookup tables with monochromatic and full-color distributions",
