    "description": "Using Python\u00ae language for the validation of the CCI soil moisture products via SM2RAIN.\n\nRemote sensing techniques provide a new way to obtain hydrological variables (i.e. rainfall and soil moisture), mainly in poorly instrumented areas that are fundamental for natural hazard assessment and mitigation. The ever increasing availability of satellite derived products characterized by high temporal and spatial coverage requires the development of techniques and instruments for big data volume managing. Moreover, the use of open source systems is highly encouraged in order to increase their use by the scientific community. In this study, the application of the SM2RAIN algorithm to the CCI soil moisture product is proposed as a case study.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'moisture', 'CCI', 'EODC', 'instrumented'",
