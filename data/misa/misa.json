EST (expressed sequence tag) database comprising 24,595 sequences. In total, 1,856 SSR-containing sequences were identified. Trimeric SSR repeat motifs appeared to be the most abundant type. A subset of 311 primer pairs flanking SSR loci have been used for screening polymorphisms among six barley cultivars, being parents of three mapping populations. As a result, 76 EST-derived SSR-markers were integrated into a barley genetic consensus map. A correlation between polymorphism and the number of repeats was observed for SSRs built of dimeric up to tetrameric units. 3\u2032-ESTs yielded a higher portion of polymorphic SSRs (64%) than 5\u2032-ESTs did. The estimated PIC (polymorphic information content) value was 0.45 \u00b1 0.03. Approximately 80% of the SSR-markers amplified DNA fragments in Hordeum bulbosum, followed by rye, wheat (both about 60%) and rice (40%). A subset of 38 EST-derived SSR-markers comprising 114 alleles were used to investigate genetic diversity among 54 barley cultivars. In accordance with a previous, RFLP-based, study, spring and winter cultivars, as well as two- and six-rowed barleys, formed separate clades upon PCoA analysis. The results show that: (1) with the software tool developed, EST databases can be efficiently exploited for the development of cDNA-SSRs, (2) EST-derived SSRs are significantly less polymorphic than those derived from genomic regions, (3) a considerable portion of the developed SSRs can be transferred to related species, and (4) compared to RFLP-markers, cDNA-SSRs yield similar patterns of genetic diversity.", "citationCount": 1227, "authors": [{"name": "Thiel T."}, {"name": "Michalek W."}, {"name": "Varshney R.K."}, {"name": "Graner A."}], "date": "2003-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Theoretical and Applied Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Thomas Thiel", "url": "http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "thiel@ipk-gatersleben.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:misa", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0415"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Allows the identification and localization of perfect microsatellites as well as compound microsatellites which are interrupted by a certain number of bases.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/misa-microsatellite-identification-tool.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "misa", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:49:39Z", "name": "MISA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
