Arabidopsis Coexpression Tool (ACT), a gene coexpression analysis web tool for Arabidopsis thaliana, identifies genes which are correlated to a driver gene. Primary microarray data from ATH1 Affymetrix platform were processed with Single-Channel Array Normalization algorithm and combined to produce a coexpression tree which contains ∼21,000 A. thaliana genes. ACT was developed to present subclades of coexpressed genes, as well as to perform gene set enrichment analysis, being unique in revealing enriched transcription factors targeting coexpressed genes. ACT offers a simple and user-friendly interface producing working hypotheses which can be experimentally verified for the discovery of gene partnership, pathway membership, and transcriptional regulation. ACT analyses have been successful in identifying not only genes with coordinated ubiquitous expressions but also genes with tissue-specific expressions.",

                "abstract": "The Arabidopsis Co-expression Tool, ACT, ranks the genes across a large microarray dataset according to how closely their expression follows the expression of a query gene. A database stores pre-calculated co-expression results for ∼21 800 genes based on data from over 300 arrays. These results can be corroborated by calculation of co-expression results for user-defined sub-sets of arrays or experiments from the NASC/GARNet array dataset. Clique Finder (CF) identifies groups of genes which are consistently co-expressed with each other across a user-defined co-expression list. The parameters can be altered easily to adjust cluster size and the output examined for optimal inclusion of genes with known biological roles. Alternatively, a Scatter Plot tool displays the correlation coefficients for all genes against two user-selected queries on a scatter plot which can be useful for visual identification of clusters of genes with similar r-values. User-input groups of genes can be highlighted on the scatter plots. Inclusion of genes with known biology in sets of genes identified using CF and Scatter Plot tools allows inferences to be made about the roles of the other genes in the set and both tools can therefore be used to generate short lists of genes for further characterization.

The analysis begins with the collection of primary transcriptomic data and their preprocessing, continues with the calculation of the similarity between genes based on their expression values in the selected sample dataset and results in the construction and visualisation of a gene coexpression network (GCN) and its evaluation using biological term enrichment analysis. As gene coexpression analysis has been studied ex-tensively, we present most parts of the methodology in a clear manner and the reasoning behind the selection of some of the techniques. In this review, we offer a comprehensive and comprehensi-ble account of the steps required for performing a complete gene coexpression analysis in eukary-otic organisms. We comment on the use of RNA‐Seq vs. microarrays, as well as the best practices for GCN construction. Furthermore, we recount the most popular webtools and standalone applications performing gene coexpression analysis, with details on their methods, features and outputs.",

                "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Genes with similar expression patterns across multiple samples are considered coexpressed, and they may participate in similar biological processes or pathways. Gene coexpression networks depict the degree of similarity between the expression profiles of all genes in a set of samples. Gene coexpression tools allow for the prediction of functional gene partners or the assignment of roles to genes of unknown function. Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) is an R package that provides a multitude of functions for constructing and analyzing a weighted or unweighted gene coexpression network. Methods: Previously preprocessed, high-quality gene expression data of 3500 samples of Affymetrix microarray technology from various tissues of the Arabidopsis thaliana plant model species were used to construct a weighted gene coexpression network, using WGCNA. Results: The gene dendrogram was used as the basis for the creation of a new Arabidopsis coexpression tool (ACT) version (ACT2.6). The dendrogram contains 21,273 leaves, each one corresponding to a single gene. Genes that are clustered in the same clade are coexpressed. WGCNA grouped the genes into 27 functional modules, all of which were positively or negatively correlated with specific tissues. Discussion: Genes known to be involved in common metabolic pathways were discovered in the same module. By comparing the current ACT version with the previous one, it was shown that the new version outperforms the old one in discovering the functional connections between gene partners. ACT2.6 is a major upgrade over the previous version and a significant addition to the collection of public gene coexpression tools.",

                "abstract": "We present a new WWW-based tool for plant gene analysis, the Arabidopsis Co-Expression Tool (ACT), based on a large Arabidopsis thaliana microarray data set obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre. The co-expression analysis tool allows users to identify genes whose expression patterns are correlated across selected experiments or the complete data set. Results are accompanied by estimates of the statistical significance of the correlation relationships, expressed as probability (P) and expectation (E) values. Additionally, highly ranked genes on a correlation list can be examined using the novel CLIQUE FINDER tool to determine the sets of genes most likely to be regulated in a similar manner. In combination, these tools offer three levels of analysis: creation of correlation lists of co-expressed genes, refinement of these lists using two-dimensional scatter plots, and dissection into cliques of co-regulated genes. We illustrate the applications of the software by analysing genes encoding functionally related proteins, as well as pathways involved in plant responses to environmental stimuli. These analyses demonstrate novel biological relationships underlying the observed gene co-expression patterns. To demonstrate the ability of the software to develop testable hypotheses on gene function within a defined biological process we have used the example of cell wall biosynthesis genes.
