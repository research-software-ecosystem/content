description: Identifying the variants of dna sequences sensitively and accurately
  is an important but challenging task in the field of genomics. this task is particularly
  difficult when dealing with single molecule sequencing, the error rate of which
  is still tens to hundreds of times higher than next generation sequencing. with
  the increasing prevalence of single molecule sequencing, an efficient variant caller
  will not only expedite basic research but also enable various downstream applications.
  to meet this demand, we developed clairvoyante, a multi-task five-layer convolutional
  neural network model for predicting variant type, zygosity, alternative allele and
  indel length. on na12878, clairvoyante achieved 99.73%, 97.68% and 95.36% accuracy
  on known variants, and achieved 98.65%, 92.57%, 77.89% f1 score on the whole genome,
  in illumina, pacbio, and oxford nanopore data, respectively. training clairvoyante
  with a sample and call variant on another shows that clairvoyante is sample agnostic
  and general for variant calling. a slim version of clairvoyante with reduced model
  parameters produced a much lower f1, suggesting the full model's power in disentangling
  subtle details in read alignment. clairvoyante is the first method for single molecule
  sequencing to finish a whole genome variant calling in two hours on a 28 cpu-core
  machine, with top-tier accuracy and sensitivity. a toolset was developed to train,
  utilize and visualize the clairvoyante model easily, and is publically available
  here is this repo.
