An integrated approach that combines results from multiple data types is best suited for optimal target selection. We developed TargetMine, a data warehouse for efficient target prioritisation. TargetMine utilises the InterMine framework, with new data models such as protein-DNA interactions integrated in a novel way. It enables complicated searches that are difficult to perform with existing tools and it also offers integration of custom annotations and in-house experimental data. We proposed an objective protocol for target prioritisation using TargetMine and set up a benchmarking procedure to evaluate its performance. The results show that the protocol can identify known disease-associated genes with high precision and coverage. A demonstration version of TargetMine is available at http://targetmine.nibio.go.jp/. © 2011 Chen et al.","authors":["Chen Y.-A.","Tripathi L.P.","Mizuguchi K."],"cit_count":76,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0017844","journal":"PLoS ONE","title":"TargetMine, an integrated data warehouse for candidate gene prioritisation and target discovery","type":"Primary","year":"2011-03-14"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:targetmine","biotoolsID":"targetmine","description":"Integrated data warehouse for retrieval of target genes and proteins for experimental characterisation and drug discovery.
