For the past 3 years, its data content and access have increased substantially. Here we describe several of its new and improved features, such as data content, which now includes over 60 000 measurements derived from transcriptomics, proteomics, genomics and miRNA profiles from various pancreas-centred reports on a broad range of specimen and experimental types. We also illustrate the capabilities of its interface, which allows integrative queries that can combine PED data with a growing number of biological resources such as NCBI, Ensembl, UniProt and Reactome. Thus, PED is capable of retrieving and integrating different types of -omics, annotations and clinical data. We also focus on the importance of data sharing and interoperability in the cancer field, and the integration of PED into the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) data portal. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 25, "authors": [{"name": "Cutts R.J."}, {"name": "Gadaleta E."}, {"name": "Hahn S.A."}, {"name": "Crnogorac-Jurcevic T."}, {"name": "Lemoine N.R."}, {"name": "Chelala C."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "21666272", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Using BioMart as a framework to manage and query pancreatic cancer data", "abstract": "We describe the Pancreatic Expression Database (PED), the first cancer database originally designed based on the BioMart infrastructure.
