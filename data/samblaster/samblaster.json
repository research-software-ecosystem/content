Bioinformatic analysis pipelines are having trouble keeping pace. A common bottleneck in such pipelines is the requirement to read, write, sort and compress large BAM files multiple times. Results: We present SAMBLASTER, a tool that reduces the number of times such costly operations are performed. SAMBLASTER is designed to mark duplicates in read-sorted SAM files as a piped postpass on DNA aligner output before it is compressed to BAM. In addition, it can simultaneously output into separate files the discordant read-pairs and/or split-read mappings used for structural variant calling. As an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and runtime. As a stand-Alone duplicate marking tool, it performs significantly better than PICARD or SAMBAMBA in terms of both speed and memory usage, while achieving nearly identical results. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2014.", "citationCount": 80, "authors": [{"name": "Faust G.G."}, {"name": "Hall I.M."}], "date": "2014-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gf4ea@virginia.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:samblaster", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/GregoryFaust/samblaster", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Split read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3199"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A tool to mark duplicates and extract discordant and split reads from SAM files.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/samblaster-0-1-15-duplicate-marking-and-structural-variant-read-extraction.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "samblaster", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:58:58Z", "name": "SAMBLASTER", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/GregoryFaust/samblaster", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
