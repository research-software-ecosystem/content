summary: marks duplicates, extracts discordant/split reads
description: >
   Current "next-generation" sequencing technologies cannot tell what
   exact sequence they will be reading. They take what is available. And
   if some sequences are read very often, then this needs some extra
   biomedical thinking. The genome could for instance be duplicated.
   .
   samblaster is a fast and flexible program for marking duplicates in
   read-id grouped paired-end SAM files. It can also optionally output
   discordant read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files,
   and/or unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file. When marking
   duplicates, samblaster will require approximately 20MB of memory per
   1M read pairs.
