description: Current "next-generation" sequencing technologies cannot tell what exact
  sequence they will be reading. They take what is available. And if some sequences
  are read very often, then this needs some extra biomedical thinking. The genome
  could for instance be duplicated. . samblaster is a fast and flexible program for
  marking duplicates in read-id grouped paired-end SAM files. It can also optionally
  output discordant read pairs and/or split read mappings to separate SAM files, and/or
  unmapped/clipped reads to a separate FASTQ file. When marking duplicates, samblaster
  will require approximately 20MB of memory per 1M read pairs.
