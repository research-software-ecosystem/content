It is simple, flexible, and much faster than conventional frameworks because it runs on graphics cards. © 2019 The AuthorsSimulating morphogenesis of both mesenchyme and epithelium has typically required complex and computationally expensive models. To meet this challenge, we developed ya||a—yet another parallel agent-based model. Our model extends the spheroid model by the addition of spin-like polarities to simulate epithelial sheets and tissue polarity using pairwise interactions only. This design is simple and lends itself to parallelization, and we implemented it together with recent models for protrusions and migration for GPUs for high performance. ya||a is written in concise, plain CUDA/C++ and available at github.com/germannp/yalla under the MIT license.",
