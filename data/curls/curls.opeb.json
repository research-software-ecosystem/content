The majority of existing ultrasound protocols have been developed and implemented in high-resource settings. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), patients with heart failure of various etiologies commonly present late in the disease process, with a similar syndrome of dyspnea, edema and cardiomegaly on chest X-ray. The causes of heart failure in SSA differ from those in high-resource settings. Point-of-care ultrasound has the potential to identify the underlying etiology of heart failure, and lead to targeted therapy.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ultrasound', 'Cardiac ultrasound resource-limited settings', 'high-resource', 'cardiomegaly SSA'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31883027","name":"CURLS"}}
