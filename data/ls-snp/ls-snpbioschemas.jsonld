The current version provides information useful for identifying amino-acid changing SNPs (nsSNPs) that are most likely to have an impact on biological function. The system is kept up-to-date by an automated, high-throughput build pipeline that systematically maps human nsSNPs onto Protein Data Bank structures and annotates several biologically relevant features, inferred from three-dimensional experimental structures.",
