As the majority of mutations associated with complex traits are located outside the exome, it is crucial to investigate the potential pathogenic impact of indels in non-coding regions of the human genome. Results: We present FATHMM-indel, an integrative approach to predict the functional effect, pathogenic or neutral, of indels in non-coding regions of the human genome. Our method exploits various genomic annotations in addition to sequence data. When validated on benchmark data, FATHMM-indel significantly outperforms CADD and GAVIN, state of the art models in assessing the pathogenic impact of non-coding variants. FATHMM-indel is available via a web server at indels.biocompute.org.uk. Conclusions: FATHMM-indel can accurately predict the functional impact and prioritise small indels throughout the whole non-coding genome.","authors":["Ferlaino M.","Rogers M.F.","Shihab H.A.","Mort M.","Cooper D.N.","Gaunt T.R.","Campbell C."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-017-1862-y","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"An integrative approach to predicting the functional effects of small indels in non-coding regions of the human genome","type":"Primary","year":"2017-10-06"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fathmm-indel","biotoolsID":"fathmm-indel","description":"Predict the functional class, pathogenic or neutral, of small indels throughout the whole non-coding genome.","homepage":"http://indels.biocompute.org.uk/","name":"FATHMM-indel"}}
