As the majority of mutations associated with complex traits are located outside the exome, it is crucial to investigate the potential pathogenic impact of indels in non-coding regions of the human genome. Results: We present FATHMM-indel, an integrative approach to predict the functional effect, pathogenic or neutral, of indels in non-coding regions of the human genome. Our method exploits various genomic annotations in addition to sequence data. When validated on benchmark data, FATHMM-indel significantly outperforms CADD and GAVIN, state of the art models in assessing the pathogenic impact of non-coding variants. FATHMM-indel is available via a web server at indels.biocompute.org.uk. Conclusions: FATHMM-indel can accurately predict the functional impact and prioritise small indels throughout the whole non-coding genome.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Ferlaino M."}, {"name": "Rogers M.F."}, {"name": "Shihab H.A."}, {"name": "Mort M."}, {"name": "Cooper D.N."}, {"name": "Gaunt T.R."}, {"name": "Campbell C."}], "date": "2017-10-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Michael Ferlaino", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "michael.ferlaino@bdi.ox.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:fathmm-indel", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://indels.biocompute.org.uk/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predict the functional class, pathogenic or neutral, of small indels throughout the whole non-coding genome.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "fathmm-indel", "additionDate": "2018-07-28T09:43:39Z", "name": "FATHMM-indel", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
