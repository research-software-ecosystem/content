Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation Protein-protein interactions are vital for protein function with the average protein having between three and ten interacting partners. Knowledge of precise protein-protein interfaces comes from crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), but only 50% of structures in the PDB are complexes. There is therefore a need to predict protein-protein interfaces in silico and various methods for this purpose. Here we explore the use of a predictor based on structural features and which exploits random forest machine learning, comparing its performance with a number of popular established methods. Results On an independent test set of obligate and transient complexes, our IntPred predictor performs well (MCC = 0.370, ACC = 0.811, SPEC = 0.916, SENS = 0.411) and compares favourably with other methods. Overall, IntPred ranks second of six methods tested with SPPIDER having slightly better overall performance (MCC = 0.410, ACC = 0.759, SPEC = 0.783, SENS = 0.676), but considerably worse specificity than IntPred. As with SPPIDER, using an independent test set of obligate complexes enhanced performance (MCC = 0.381) while performance is somewhat reduced on a dataset of transient complexes (MCC = 0.303). The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity compared with SPPIDER suggests that the choice of the appropriate tool is application-dependent.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Northey T.C."}, {"name": "BaresiA A."}, {"name": "Martin A.C.R."}], "date": "2018-01-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Andrew Martin", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "andrew.martin@ucl.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:intpred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bioinf.org.uk/intpred/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein-protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2464"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Structure-based predictor of protein\u2013protein interaction sites.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "intpred", "additionDate": "2018-06-20T16:11:11Z", "name": "IntPred", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.bioinf.org.uk/intpred/paper/SupplementaryMaterial.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
