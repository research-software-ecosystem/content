We provide a method, LEB (Localize-and-Extract Biclusters) which reduces the search space into local neighborhoods within the matrix by first localizing correlated structures. The localization procedure takes its roots from effective use of graph-theoretical methods applied to problems exhibiting a similar structure to that of biclustering. Once interesting structures are localized the search space reduces to small neighborhoods and the biclusters are extracted from these localities. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments both using artificial and real datasets. \u00a9Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Erten C."}, {"name": "Sozdinler M."}], "date": "2009-08-11T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://hacivat.khas.edu.tr/~cesim", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:leb", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://hacivat.khas.edu.tr/~cesim/leb.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "LEB is a software of biclustering gene expression data, based on Localize-and-Extract Biclusters", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/leb-localize-extract-biclusters.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "leb", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:08:10Z", "name": "LEB", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/leb-localize-extract-biclusters.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
