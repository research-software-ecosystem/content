It provides a user-friendly environment in which microbiologists, microbial ecologists and biological mathematicians can rapidly and robustly characterize the dynamics of ecological motifs of up to three microbial species, without the requirement to develop their own code, programme models or rely on a detailed knowledge of the mathematics of dynamical systems analysis.",
