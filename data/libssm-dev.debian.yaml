  description: macromolecular superposition library - development files
  long_description: " SSM is a macromolecular coordinate superposition library, written\
    \ by\n Eugene Krissinel of the EBI.\n .\n The library implements the SSM algorithm\
    \ of protein structure\n comparison in three dimensions, which includes an original\
    \ procedure\n of matching graphs built on the protein's secondary-structure\n\
    \ elements, followed by an iterative three-dimensional alignment of\n protein\
    \ backbone Calpha atoms.\n .\n This package contains libraries and header files\
    \ needed for program\n development.\n"
