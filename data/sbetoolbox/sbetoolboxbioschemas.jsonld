  "sc:description": "Systems Biology and Evolution Toolbox is being developed in MATLAB as a menu-driven GUI software to determine various statistics of the biological network. Some of its features include (but not limited to) algorithms to create random networks (small-world, ring lattice etc.), deduce clusters in the network (MCL, mCode, clusterOne), compute various network topology measures etc.",
