All rights reserved.Aim: This study aimed to sequence the Cytochrome c oxidase (COX-1) gene sequence from mitochondrial DNA of Sarcoptes scabiei isolated from Lamongan goats and Mojokerto rabbits, align it with DNA isolated from Zi'gong rabbit (GenBank accession No. EU256389.1), and produce a phylogenetic analysis of S. scabiei COX-1 gene. Materials and Methods: S. scabiei mites were obtained from goats and rabbits, and DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit. The forward and reverse primer sequences were designed based on the DNA sequence of an S. scabiei COX-1 gene isolated from the Zi'gong rabbit (5'-TCTTAGGGGCTGGATTTAGTATG-3' and 5'-AGTTCCTCTACCAGTTCCAC-3', respectively). To confirm sequencing output, the sequence resulting from the reverse primer was inverted and aligned to the sequence from the forward primer using Clone Manager Professional Version 9 for Windows (Scientific & Educational Software; http://www.scied.com). This alignment was subsequently used to build a phylogenetic tree, using the Neighbor-Joining method, in the MEGA6 program (https://www.megasoftware.net/).Results: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products from S. scabiei isolates from Lamongan goats and Mojokerto rabbits produced bands of around 290 bp with 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Comparing the DNA sequences of the S. scabiei COX-1 gene with those isolated from Lamongan goats and Mojokerto rabbits showed 99% homology. Conclusion: PCR products of the S. scabiei COX-1 gene isolated from Lamongan goats and Mojokerto rabbits were around 290 bp long. The sequences had more than 99% homology. The sequences of the COX-1 gene of S. scabiei from Lamongan goats and Mojokerto rabbits were relatively close to the sequence of the gene in S. scabiei obtained from various hosts according to National Center for Biotechnology Information data.",
