  "sc:description": "Reconstruct Ancestral gene orders as CARs (Contiguous Ancestral Regions) with a progressive homology-based method. The method runs from a phylogeny tree (without branch lengths needed) with a marked ancestor and a block file. This homology-based method is based on iteratively detecting and assembling ancestral adjacencies, while allowing some micro-rearrangements of synteny blocks at the extremities of the progressively assembled CARs.",
