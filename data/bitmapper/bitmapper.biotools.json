However, existing methods of all-mappers, which aim at finding all mapping locations of each read, are very time consuming. The majority of existing all-mappers consist of 2 main parts, filtration and verification. This work significantly reduces verification time, which is the dominant part of the running time. Results: An efficient all-mapper, BitMapper, is developed based on a new vectorized bit-vector algorithm, which simultaneously calculates the edit distance of one read to multiple locations in a given reference genome. Experimental results on both simulated and real data sets show that BitMapper is from several times to an order of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art all-mappers, while achieving higher sensitivity, i.e., better quality solutions. Conclusions: We present BitMapper, which is designed to return all mapping locations of raw reads containing indels as well as mismatches. BitMapper is implemented in C under a GPL license.
