Inconsistent representation of variants among variant callers, local databases, and tools results in discrepancies that complicate analysis. NCBI's genetic variation resources, dbSNP and ClinVar, require a robust, scalable set of principles to manage asserted sequence variants. RESULTS:The SPDI data model defines variants as a sequence of four attributes: sequence, position, deletion and insertion, and can be applied to nucleotide and protein variants. NCBI web services convert representations among HGVS, VCF, and SPDI and provide two functions to aggregate variants.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31738401","name":"SPDI"}}
