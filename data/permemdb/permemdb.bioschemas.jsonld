  "sc:description": "A database for eukaryotic peripheral membrane proteins.\n\nThe majority of all proteins in cells interact with membranes either permanently or temporarily. Peripheral membrane proteins form transient complexes with membrane proteins and or lipids, via non-covalent interactions and are of outmost importance, due to numerous cellular functions in which they participate. In an effort to collect data regarding this heterogeneous group of proteins we designed and constructed a database, called PerMemDB. PerMemDB is currently the most complete and comprehensive repository of data for eukaryotic peripheral membrane proteins deposited in UniProt or predicted with the use of MBPpred - a computational method that specializes in the detection of proteins that interact non-covalently with membrane lipids, via membrane binding domains. The first version of the database contains 231,770 peripheral membrane proteins from 1009 organisms.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!",
