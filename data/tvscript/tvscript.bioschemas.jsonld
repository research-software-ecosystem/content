      "sc:description": "TVscript is a tool designed to allow the user to explore the removal of transcripts associated with intra-condition read count variation that is greater than a user specified threshold. A set of updated count files is produced from the original input data in which such transcripts are absent. These updated count files can be subsequently used within downstream analysis, for example, in the identification of differentially expressed transcripts. In the latter, the extent intra-condition variation affects the final lists of identified genes ambiguously, and inconsistently, across different software designed for this task. Being able to explore the effects of removing such variation at varying thresholds increases the intuitive insight relative to both differential expression analysis and to other areas of research that use such data.",
