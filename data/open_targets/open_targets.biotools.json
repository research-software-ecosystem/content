    "description": "Open Targets is a pre-competitive, public-private partnership that uses human genetics and genomics data to systematically identify and prioritise drug targets. Through large-scale genomic experiments and the development of innovative computational techniques, the partnership aims to help researchers select the best targets for the development of new therapies. \n\nAt the heart of Open Targets is a consortium of complementary partner institutions that bring their respective expertise and capabilities  to collaborative experimental and informatics projects. \n\nBridging the gap between academic research and pharmaceutical drug development, Open Targets has made significant contributions to understanding the relationships between targets and diseases, established leading informatics tools in the Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics, and contributed to global initiatives such as the Cancer Dependency Map.",
