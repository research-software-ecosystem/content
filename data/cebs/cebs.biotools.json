This resource grants public access to search and collate data from over 10 250 studies for 12 750 test articles (chemicals, environmental agents). CEBS has made considerable strides over the last 5 years to integrate growing internal data repositories into data warehouses and data marts to better serve the public with high quality curated datasets. This effort includes harmonizing legacy terms and metadata to current standards, mapping test articles to external identifiers, and aligning terms to OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology) Foundry ontologies. The data are made available through the CEBS Homepage (https://cebs.niehs.nih.gov/cebs/), guided search applications, flat files on FTP (file transfer protocol), and APIs (application programming interface) for user access and to provide a bridge for computational tools. The user interface is intuitive with a single search bar to query keywords related to study metadata, publications, and data availability. Results are consolidated to single pages for each test article with NTP conclusions, publications, individual studies, data collections, and links to related test articles and projects available together.",
