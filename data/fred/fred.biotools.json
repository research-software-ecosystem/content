    "description": "FRED is a framework for T-cell epitope detection that offers consistent, easy, and simultaneous access to well established prediction methods for MHC binding and antigen processing. FRED can handle polymorphic proteins and offers analysis tools to combine, benchmark, or compare different methods. It is implemented in Python in a modular way and can easily be extended by user defined methods.",

Computational approaches, in particular the prediction of T-cell epitopes using machine learning methods, are at the core of modern vaccine design. Large-scale analyses and the integration or comparison of different methods become increasingly important. We have developed FRED, an extendable, open source software framework for key tasks in immunoinformatics. In this, its first version, FRED offers easily accessible prediction methods for MHC binding and antigen processing as well as general infrastructure for the handling of antigen sequence data and epitopes. FRED is implemented in Python in a modular way and allows the integration of external methods. \u00a9 2009 The Author(s).",
