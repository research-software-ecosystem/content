  "sc:description": "FRED is a framework for T-cell epitope detection that offers consistent, easy, and simultaneous access to well established prediction methods for MHC binding and antigen processing. FRED can handle polymorphic proteins and offers analysis tools to combine, benchmark, or compare different methods. It is implemented in Python in a modular way and can easily be extended by user defined methods.",
