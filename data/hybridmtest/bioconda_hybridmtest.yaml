description: Performs hybrid multiple testing that incorporates method selection and
  assumption evaluations into the analysis using empirical Bayes probability (EBP)
  estimates obtained by Grenander density estimation. For instance, for 3-group comparison
  analysis, Hybrid Multiple testing considers EBPs as weighted EBPs between F-test
  and H-test with EBPs from Shapiro Wilk test of normality as weigth. Instead of just
  using EBPs from F-test only or using H-test only, this methodology combines both
  types of EBPs through EBPs from Shapiro Wilk test of normality. This methodology
  uses then the law of total EBPs.
