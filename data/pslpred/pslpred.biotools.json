                "abstract": "Summary: We developed a web server PSLpred for predicting subcellular localization of gram-negative bacterial proteins with an. overall accuracy of 91.2%. PSLpred is a hybrid approach-based method that integrates PSI-BLAST and three SVM modules based on compositions of residues, dipeptides and physico-chemical properties. The prediction accuracies of 90.7, 86.8, 90.3, 95.2 and 90.6% were attained for cytoplasmic, extracellular, inner-membrane, outer-membrane and periplasmic proteins, respectively. Furthermore, PSLpred was able to predict \u223c74% of sequences with an average prediction accuracy of 98% at RI = 5. \u00a9 The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.
