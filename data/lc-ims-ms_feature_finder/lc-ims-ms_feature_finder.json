Results: We introduce a command line software application LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder that searches for molecular ion signatures in multidimensional liquid chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) data by clustering deisotoped peaks with similar monoisotopic mass, charge state, LC elution time and ion mobility drift time values. The software application includes an algorithm for detecting and quantifying co-eluting chemical species, including species that exist in multiple conformations that may have been separated in the IMS dimension. Availability: LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder is available as a command-line tool for download at http://omics.pnl.gov/software/LC-IMS-MS-Feature-Finder.php. The Microsoft.NET Framework 4.0 is required to run the software. All other dependencies are included with the software package. Usage of this software is limited to non-profit research to use (see README). \u00a9 2013 The Author 2013.", "citationCount": 17, "authors": [{"name": "Crowell K.L."}, {"name": "Slysz G.W."}, {"name": "Baker E.S."}, {"name": "LaMarche B.L."}, {"name": "Monroe M.E."}, {"name": "Ibrahim Y.M."}, {"name": "Payne S.H."}, {"name": "Anderson G.A."}, {"name": "Smith R.D."}], "date": "2013-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://omics.pnl.gov/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:lc-ims-ms_feature_finder", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://omics.pnl.gov/software/lc-ims-ms-feature-finder", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:21:07Z", "otherID": [], "description": "LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder is a command line software application that searches for molecular ion signatures in multidimensional liquid chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-IMS-MS) data by clustering deisotoped peaks with similar monoisotopic mass, charge state, LC elution time, and ion mobility drift time values.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/lc-ims-ms-feature-finder-detecting-multidimensional-liquid-chromatography-ion-mobility-and-mass-spectrometry-features.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "lc-ims-ms_feature_finder", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:08:12Z", "name": "LC-IMS-MS Feature Finder", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
