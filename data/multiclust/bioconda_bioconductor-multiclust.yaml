about:
  description: Clustering is carried out to identify patterns in transcriptomics profiles
    to determine clinically relevant subgroups of patients. Feature (gene) selection
    is a critical and an integral part of the process. Currently, there are many feature
    selection and clustering methods to identify the relevant genes and perform clustering
    of samples. However, choosing an appropriate methodology is difficult. In addition,
    extensive feature selection methods have not been supported by the available packages.
    Hence, we developed an integrative R-package called multiClust that allows researchers
    to experiment with the choice of combination of methods for gene selection and
    clustering with ease. Using multiClust, we identified the best performing clustering
    methodology in the context of clinical outcome. Our observations demonstrate that
    simple methods such as variance-based ranking perform well on the majority of
    data sets, provided that the appropriate number of genes is selected. However,
    different gene ranking and selection methods remain relevant as no methodology
    works for all studies.
