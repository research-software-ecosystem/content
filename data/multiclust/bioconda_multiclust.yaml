description: Clustering is carried out to identify patterns in transcriptomics profiles
  to determine clinically relevant subgroups of patients. Feature (gene) selection
  is a critical and an integral part of the process. Currently, there are many feature
  selection and clustering methods to identify the relevant genes and perform clustering
  of samples. However, choosing an appropriate methodology is difficult. In addition,
  extensive feature selection methods have not been supported by the available packages.
  Hence, we developed an integrative R-package called multiClust that allows researchers
  to experiment with the choice of combination of methods for gene selection and clustering
  with ease. Using multiClust, we identified the best performing clustering methodology
  in the context of clinical outcome. Our observations demonstrate that simple methods
  such as variance-based ranking perform well on the majority of data sets, provided
  that the appropriate number of genes is selected. However, different gene ranking
  and selection methods remain relevant as no methodology works for all studies.
