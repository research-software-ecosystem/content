      "sc:description": "Novel Sequence Insertion Detection by Constructing an Extended Reference.\n\nNext generation sequencing technology has led to the development of methods for the detection of novel sequence insertions (nsINS). Multiple signatures from short reads are usually extracted to improve nsINS detection performance. However, characterization of nsINSs larger than the mean insert size is still challenging. This paper presents a new method, ERINS, to detect nsINS contents and genotypes of full spectrum range size. It integrates the features of structural variations and mapping states of split reads to find nsINS breakpoints, and then adopts a left-most mapping strategy to infer nsINS content by iteratively extending the standard reference at each breakpoint. Finally, it realigns all reads to the extended reference and infers nsINS genotypes through statistical testing on read counts. We test and validate the performance of ERINS on simulation and real sequencing datasets.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
