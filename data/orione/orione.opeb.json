However, the construction of computational pipelines that use different software packages is difficult owing to a lack of interoperability, reproducibility and transparency. To overcome these limitations we present Orione, a Galaxy-based framework consisting of publicly available research software and specifically designed pipelines to build complex, reproducible workflows for next-generation sequencing microbiology data analysis. Enabling microbiology researchers to conduct their own custom analysis and data manipulation without software installation or programming, Orione provides new opportunities for data-intensive computational analyses in microbiology and metagenomics. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Cuccuru G.","Orsini M.","Pinna A.","Sbardellati A.","Soranzo N.","Travaglione A.","Uva P.","Zanetti G.","Fotia G."],"cit_count":54,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu135","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Orione, a web-based framework for NGS analysis in microbiology","type":"Primary","year":"2014-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:orione","biotoolsID":"orione","description":"Specialized domain server for integrative analysis of NGS microbial data, that covers the whole life cycle of microbiology research data, bringing together all the tools to perform steps such as quality check, alignment, assembly, scaffolding and annotation.","homepage":"http://orione.crs4.it","name":"Orione","version":["1"]}}
