      "sc:description": "an open-source tool for exploring 3D super-resolution data.\n\nLocalization-based super-resolution microscopy techniques such as PALM, STORM, and PAINT are increasingly critical tools for biological discovery. These methods generate lists of single fluorophore positions that capture nanoscale structural details of subcellular organisation, but to develop biological insight, we must post-process and visualize this data in a meaningful way. A large number of algorithms have been developed for localization post-processing, transforming point data into representations which approximate traditional microscopy images, and performing specific quantitative analysis directly on points. Implementations of these algorithms typically stand in isolation, necessitating complex workflows involving multiple different software packages",
