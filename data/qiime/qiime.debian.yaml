description: "QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis\
  \ package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables researchers\
  \ to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with publication-quality\
  \ figures and statistical results. Key features:\n * Integrated and automatic tracking\
  \ of data provenance\n * Semantic type system\n * Plugin system for extending microbiome\
  \ analysis functionality\n * Support for multiple types of user interfaces (e.g.\
  \ API, command line,\ngraphical) . QIIME 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of\
  \ the QIIME 1 microbiome analysis pipeline. QIIME 2 will address many of the limitations\
  \ of QIIME 1, while retaining the features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful and widely-used\
  \ analysis pipeline. . QIIME 2 currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome\
  \ analysis pipeline. New functionality will regularly become available through QIIME\
  \ 2 plugins. You can view a list of plugins that are currently available on the\
  \ QIIME 2 plugin availability page. The future plugins page lists plugins that are\
  \ being developed.\n"
