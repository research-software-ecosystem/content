description: 'QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis
  package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables researchers
  to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with publication-quality
  figures and statistical results. Key features: * Integrated and automatic tracking
  of data provenance * Semantic type system * Plugin system for extending microbiome
  analysis functionality * Support for multiple types of user interfaces (e.g. API,
  command line, graphical) . QIIME 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of the QIIME
  1 microbiome analysis pipeline. QIIME 2 will address many of the limitations of
  QIIME 1, while retaining the features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful and widely-used
  analysis pipeline. . QIIME 2 currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome
  analysis pipeline. New functionality will regularly become available through QIIME
  2 plugins. You can view a list of plugins that are currently available on the QIIME
  2 plugin availability page. The future plugins page lists plugins that are being
  developed.'
