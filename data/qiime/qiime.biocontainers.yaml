description: Open-source bioinformatics pipeline for performing microbiome analysis
  from raw dna sequencing data. the pipeline is designed to take users from raw sequencing
  data generated on the illumina or other platforms through publication quality graphics
  and statistics. this includes demultiplexing and quality filtering, otu picking,
  taxonomic assignment, and phylogenetic reconstruction, and diversity analyses and
  visualizations.
