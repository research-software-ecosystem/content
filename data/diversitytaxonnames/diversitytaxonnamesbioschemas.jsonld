      "sc:description": "DiversityTaxonNames (DWB-DTN) is an application of Diversity Workbench (DWB). It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. Each DWB module is devoted to a specific data domain. DTN is focused on the management of taxon names. Next to nomenclatural information on zoological, botanical, mycological, palaeontological, bacteriological taxon names like typification with type specimens, homotypic synonyms, basionyms, protologues and references according to the rules of the respective International Codes, it is designed to document taxonomic information. This includes accepted names (current names), heterotypic synonyms, name concepts and classifications as well as the history of changing taxonomic relations. DTN is also used to organise common names in various languages and regional taxon checklists with information on red list status and other taxon-based (ecological and nature conservation) parameters.",
