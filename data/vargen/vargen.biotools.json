    "description": "VarGen is an R package designed to get a list of variants related to a disease. It just need an OMIM morbid ID as input and optionally a list of tissues / gwas traits of interest to complete the results. You can also use your own customised list of genes. VarGen is capable of annotating the variants to help you identify the most impactful ones.",

All rights reserved.Over the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in the amount of disease-related genomic data available in public databases. However, this high-quality information is spread across independent sources and researchers often need to access these separately. Hence, there is a growing need for tools that gather and compile this information in an easy and automated manner. Here, we present VarGen , an easy-To-use, customizable R package that fetches, annotates and rank variants related to diseases and genetic disorders, using a collection public databases (viz. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian genome 5, the Genotype-Tissue Expression and the Genome Wide Association Studies catalog). This package is also capable of annotating these variants to identify the most impactful ones. We expect that this tool will benefit the research of variant-disease relationships.",
