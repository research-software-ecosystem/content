It can be used to draw conclusions from microarray and other biological data, calculating the statistical significance of each annotation. GO::TermFinder can be used on any system on which Perl can be run, either as a command line application, in single or batch mode, or as a web-based CGI script. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Boyle E.I.","Weng S.","Gollub J.","Jin H.","Botstein D.","Cherry J.M.","Sherlock G."],"cit_count":1009,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bth456","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"GO::TermFinder - Open source software for accessing Gene Ontology information and finding significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms associated with a list of genes","type":"Primary","year":"2004-12-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:go_term_finder","biotoolsID":"go_term_finder","description":"A tool for finding significant GO terms shared among a list of genes from your organism of choice.","homepage":"http://go.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/GOTermFinder","name":"Generic GO Term Finder"}}
