description: The high throughput studies often produce large amounts of numerous genes
  and proteins of interest. While it is difficult to study and validate all of them.
  Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) offers a novel approach to narrowing down long
  lists of candidates by prioritizing them based on how well they meet the research
  goal. AHP is a mathematical technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions
  where multiple criteria are involved. The technique structures problems into a hierarchy
  of elements, and helps to specify numerical weights representing the relative importance
  of each element. Numerical weight or priority derived from each element allows users
  to find alternatives that best suit their goal and their understanding of the problem.
