  "sc:description": "This tool offers a novel approach to narrow down long lists of candidates by prioritizing them based on how well they meet the research goal. It organizes and analyzes complex decisions where multiple criteria are involved. The technique structures problems into a hierarchy of elements, and helps to specify numerical weights representing the relative importance of each element.",
