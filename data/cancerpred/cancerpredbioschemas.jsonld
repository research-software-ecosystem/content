  "sc:description": "CancerPred is a web-server specially trained for predicting the Cancerlectins. Lectins are important biomolecules and play important functions in many processes e.g cell to cell recognition, host-pathogen interactions etc. In the same way Cancerlectins are those lectins which are known to play roles in cancer metastasis and tumor progress, oncogenesis etc. CancerPred is mainly designed for distinguishing Cancerlectins from Non-cancer lectins.",
