However, the number of variants identified can overwhelm clinical laboratories with strict time constraints, the final interpretation of likely pathogenicity being a particular bottleneck. To address this, we have developed an approach in which, after automatic variant calling on a standard unix pipeline, subsequent variant filtering is performed interactively, using AgileExomeFilter and AgilePindelFilter (http://dna.leeds.ac.uk/agile), tools designed for clinical scientists with standard desktop computers. To demonstrate the method's diagnostic efficacy, we tested 128 patients using (1) a targeted capture of 36 cancer-predisposing genes or (2) whole-exome capture for diagnosis of the genetically heterogeneous disorder primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD). In the cancer cohort, complete concordance with previous diagnostic data was achieved across 793 variant genotypes. A high yield (42%) was also achieved for exome-based PCD diagnosis, underscoring the scalability of our method. Simple adjustments to the variant filtering parameters further allowed the identification of a homozygous truncating mutation in a presumptive new PCD gene, DNAH8. These tools should allow diagnostic laboratories to expand their testing portfolios flexibly, using a standard set of reagents and techniques. \u00a9 2013 The Authors.", "citationCount": 24, "authors": [{"name": "Watson C.M."}, {"name": "Crinnion L.A."}, {"name": "Morgan J.E."}, {"name": "Harrison S.M."}, {"name": "Diggle C.P."}, {"name": "Adlard J."}, {"name": "Lindsay H.A."}, {"name": "Camm N."}, {"name": "Charlton R."}, {"name": "Sheridan E."}, {"name": "Bonthron D.T."}, {"name": "Taylor G.R."}, {"name": "Carr I.M."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Human Mutation"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://dna.leeds.ac.uk/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:agileexomefilter", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://dna.leeds.ac.uk/agile/AgileExomeFilter/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Enables the rapid filtering, screening and sorting of variants derived from an exome sequencing experiment, to allow the rapid detection of possible deleterious variants.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/agileexomefilter-20130422-identification-pathogenic-sequence-variants-exome-data-annotated-alamut-ht.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "agileexomefilter", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:07Z", "name": "AgileExomeFilter", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://dna.leeds.ac.uk/agile/AgileExomeFilter/guide.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
