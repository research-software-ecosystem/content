    "description": "TopProperty is a meta-predictor that combines outputs of 27 primary predictors using two ensembles of deep neural networks to predict secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane topology and membrane exposure for both transmembrane and globular proteins. TopProperty is trained on datasets without bias towards a high number of sequence homologs and the predictions are significantly better than all primary predictors on all quality metrics. TopProperty eliminates the need for protein type- or property-tailored tools, especifically for transmembrane proteins.",

                "abstract": "© Transmembrane proteins (TMPs) are critical components of cellular life. However, due to experimental challenges, the number of experimentally resolved TMP structures is severely underrepresented in databases compared to their cellular abundance. Prediction of (per-residue) features such as transmembrane topology, membrane exposure, secondary structure, and solvent accessibility can be a useful starting point for experimental design or protein structure prediction but often requires different computational tools for different features or types of proteins. We present TopProperty, a metapredictor that predicts all of these features for TMPs or globular proteins. TopProperty is trained on datasets without bias toward a high number of sequence homologs, and the predictions are significantly better than the evaluated state-of-the-art primary predictors on all quality metrics. TopProperty eliminates the need for protein type- or feature-tailored tools, specifically for TMPs. TopProperty is freely available as a web server and standalone at https://cpclab.uni-duesseldorf.de/topsuite/.",
