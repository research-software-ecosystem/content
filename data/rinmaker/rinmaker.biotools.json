                "abstract": "Background: Residue Interaction Networks (RINs) map the crystallographic description of a protein into a graph, where amino acids are represented as nodes and non-covalent bonds as edges. Determination and visualization of a protein as a RIN provides insights on the topological properties (and hence their related biological functions) of large proteins without dealing with the full complexity of the three-dimensional description, and hence it represents an invaluable tool of modern bioinformatics. Results: We present RINmaker, a fast, flexible, and powerful tool for determining and visualizing RINs that include all standard non-covalent interactions. RINmaker is offered as a cross-platform and open source software that can be used either as a command-line tool or through a web application or a web API service. We benchmark its efficiency against the main alternatives and provide explicit tests to show its performance and its correctness. Conclusions: RINmaker is designed to be fully customizable, from a simple and handy support for experimental research to a sophisticated computational tool that can be embedded into a large computational pipeline. Hence, it paves the way to bridge the gap between data-driven/machine learning approaches and numerical simulations of simple, physically motivated, models.",
