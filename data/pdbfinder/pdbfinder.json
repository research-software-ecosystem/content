These derived databanks run parallel to the PDB, i.e. they have one entry per PDB entry. Several of the well-established databanks such as HSSP, PDBREPORT and PDB REDO have been updated and/or improved. The software that creates the DSSP databank, for example, has been rewritten to better cope with \u03c0-helices. A large number of databanks have been added to aid computational structural biology; some examples are lists of residues that make crystal contacts, lists of contacting residues using a series of contact definitions or lists of residue accessibilities. PDB files are not the optimal presentation of the underlying data for many studies.We thereforemade a series of databanks that hold PDB files in an easier to use or more consistent representation. The BDB databank holds X-ray PDB files with consistently represented B-factors.We also added several visualization tools to aid the users of our databanks.", "citationCount": 179, "authors": [{"name": "Touw W.G."}, {"name": "Baakman C."}, {"name": "Black J."}, {"name": "Te Beek T.A.H."}, {"name": "Krieger E."}, {"name": "Joosten R.P."}, {"name": "Vriend G."}], "date": "2015-01-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Documentor"], "name": "DRCAT", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Project", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "vriend@cmbi.ru.nl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pdbfinder", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/gv/pdbfinder/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "PDB ID", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1127"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Structure report", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2085"}, "format": [{"term": "HTML", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2331"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This database holds for each PDB file a structured, search-engine-friendly-formatted entry that holds the data-items most likely needed for people search for certain types of PDB entries.
