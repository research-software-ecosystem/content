Recent studies suggest that short protein regions trigger this aggregation. Thus, identifying these short peptides is critical for understanding diseases and finding potential therapeutic targets. Results: We propose a method, named Pafig (Prediction of amyloid fibril-forming segments) based on support vector machines, to identify the hexpeptides associated with amyloid fibrillar aggregates. The features of Pafig were obtained by a two-round selection from AAindex. Using a 10-fold cross validation test on Hexpepset dataset, Pafig performed well with regards to overall accuracy of 81% and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.63. Pafig was used to predict the potential fibril-forming hexpeptides in all of the 64,000,000 hexpeptides. As a result, approximately 5.08% of hexpeptides showed a high aggregation propensity. In the predicted fibril-forming hexpeptides, the amino acids - alanine, phenylalanine, isoleucine, leucine and valine occurred at the higher frequencies and the amino acids - aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, lysine, arginine and praline, appeared with lower frequencies. Conclusion: The performance of Pafig indicates that it is a powerful tool for identifying the hexpeptides associated with fibrillar aggregates and will be useful for large-scale analysis of proteomic data. \u00a9 2009 Tian et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 55, "authors": [{"name": "Tian J."}, {"name": "Wu N."}, {"name": "Guo J."}, {"name": "Fan Y."}], "date": "2009-01-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.mobioinfor.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "tianjian3721@163.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pafig", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.mobioinfor.cn/pafig/index.htm", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Based on support vector machines, exploited 41 physicochemical properties to identify the specific regions associated with fibrillar aggregates.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pafig-1-0-prediction-of-amyloid-fibril-forming-segments.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "pafig", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:55:03Z", "name": "Pafig", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.mobioinfor.cn/pafig/quickhelp.htm", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
