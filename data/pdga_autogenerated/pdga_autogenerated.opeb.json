One often would like to generate new possible molecules at a specific location in chemical space marked by a molecule of interest. Herein we report the peptide design genetic algorithm (PDGA, code available at https: github.com reymondgroup PeptideDesignGA), a computational tool capable of producing peptide sequences of various chain topologies (linear, cyclic polycyclic or dendritic) in proximity of any molecule of interest in a chemical space defined by MXFP, an atom-pair fingerprint describing molecular shape and pharmacophores. We show that PDGA generates high similarity analogs of bioactive peptides, including in selected cases known active analogs, as well as of non-peptide targets.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'faerun', 'peptide design genetic algorithm'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.26434/CHEMRXIV.10247567.V2","name":"PDGA_autogenerated"}}
