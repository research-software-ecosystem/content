    "description": "The AQMM was developed to perform absolute quantification of multiple metagenomes and it's parallel metatranscriptome. In order to use this algorithm, the experiment should be designed with both metagenome and metatranscriptome data. From the initial stage, the molecular experimental data should be recorded to help on estimating the overall DNA or RNA of a unit (ml/gram) of the sample. The AQMM was demonstrated to obtain better results of differential expression genes identification in comparative metatranscriptomic studies.",
