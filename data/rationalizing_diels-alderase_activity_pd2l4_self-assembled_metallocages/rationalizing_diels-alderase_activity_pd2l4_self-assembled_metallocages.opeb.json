While many different size and shape supramolecular structures are now readily accessible, only a few are proficient catalysts. Here we show that a simple and efficient DFT-based methodology i is sufficient to accurately reproduce experimental binding affinities (MAD = 1.9 kcal mol-1) and identify the catalytic and non-catalytic Diels-Alder proficiencies (>90 % accuracy) of two homologous Pd2L4 metallocages with a variety of substrates. We demonstrate how subtle structural differences in the cage framework affect binding and catalysis, highlighting the critical role of structural dynamics and flexibility on catalytic activity","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.26434/CHEMRXIV.9576644.V1","name":"Rationalizing Diels-Alderase Activity Pd2L4 Self-Assembled Metallocages"}}
