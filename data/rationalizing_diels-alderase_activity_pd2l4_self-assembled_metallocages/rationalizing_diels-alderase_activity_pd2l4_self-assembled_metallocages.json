    "description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Pd2L4', 'cgbind', 'metallocages', 'proficiencies' | Rationalizing the \u201cDiels-Alderase\u201d Activity of Pd2L4 Self-Assembled Metallocages | Self-assembled cages have emerged as novel platforms to explore bio-inspired catalysis. While many different size and shape supramolecular structures are now readily accessible, only a few are proficient catalysts. Here we show that a simple and efficient DFT-based methodology i is sufficient to accurately reproduce experimental binding affinities (MAD = 1.9 kcal mol-1) and identify the catalytic and non-catalytic Diels-Alder proficiencies (>90 % accuracy) of two homologous Pd2L4 metallocages with a variety of substrates. We demonstrate how subtle structural differences in the cage framework affect binding and catalysis, highlighting the critical role of structural dynamics and flexibility on catalytic activity",
