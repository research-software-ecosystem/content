Thus, to fully understand the function of cancerlectin is significant because it sheds light on the future direction for the cancer therapy. However, the traditional wet-experimental methods were money- and time-consuming. It is highly desirable to develop an effective and efficient computational tool to identify cancerlectins. In this study, we developed a sequence-based method to discriminate between cancerlectins and non-cancerlectins. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to choose the optimal feature set derived from the g-gap dipeptide composition. The jackknife cross-validated results showed that the proposed method achieved the accuracy of 75.19%, which is superior to other published methods. For the convenience of other researchers, an online web-server CaLecPred was established and can be freely accessed from the website http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/CalecPred. We believe that the CaLecPred is a powerful tool to study cancerlectins and to guide the related experimental validations.", "citationCount": 33, "authors": [{"name": "Lin H."}, {"name": "Liu W.-X."}, {"name": "He J."}, {"name": "Liu X.-H."}, {"name": "Ding H."}, {"name": "Chen W."}], "date": "2015-12-09T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Scientific Reports"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Hao Lin", "url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hlin@uestc.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:calecpred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/CalecPred", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The web-server was developed to identify cancerlectin based on the sequence information.", "toolType": ["Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/calecpred-a-sequence-based-predictor-for-identifying-cancerlectin.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "calecpred", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:39:11Z", "name": "CaLecPred", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/CalecPred", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
