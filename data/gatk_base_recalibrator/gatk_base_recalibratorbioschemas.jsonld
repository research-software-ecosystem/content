  "sc:description": "This walker is designed to work as the first pass in a two-pass processing step. It does a by-locus traversal operating only at sites that are not in dbSNP. We assume that all reference mismatches we see are therefore errors and indicative of poor base quality. This walker generates tables based on various user-specified covariates (such as read group, reported quality score, cycle, and dinucleotide).",
