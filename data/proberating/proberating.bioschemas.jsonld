      "sc:description": "a recommender system to infer binding profiles for nucleic acid-binding proteins.\n\nthe interaction between proteins and nucleic acids plays a crucial role in gene regulation and cell function. Determining the binding preferences of nucleic acid-binding proteins (NBPs), namely RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and transcription factors (TFs), is the key to decipher the protein-nucleic acids interaction code. Today, available NBP binding data from in vivo or in vitro experiments are still limited, which leaves a large portion of NBPs uncovered. Unfortunately, existing computational methods that model the NBP binding preferences are mostly protein specific: they need the experimental data for a specific protein in interest, and thus only focus on experimentally characterized NBPs",
