      "sc:description": "A Multidimensional Systems Biology Analysis of Cellular Senescence in Ageing and Disease | ABSTRACT Cellular senescence, a permanent state of replicative arrest in otherwise proliferating cells, is a hallmark of ageing and has been linked to ageing-related diseases like cancer. Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in tissues of aged organisms which in turn can lead to chronic inflammation. Many genes have been associated with cell senescence, yet a comprehensive understanding of cell senescence pathways is still lacking. To this end, we created CellAge ( http: genomics.senescence.info cells ), a manually curated database of 279 human genes associated with cellular senescence, and performed various integrative and functional analyses",
