Senescent cells have been shown to accumulate in tissues of aged organisms which in turn can lead to chronic inflammation. Many genes have been associated with cell senescence, yet a comprehensive understanding of cell senescence pathways is still lacking. To this end, we created CellAge ( http: genomics.senescence.info cells ), a manually curated database of 279 human genes associated with cellular senescence, and performed various integrative and functional analyses",
