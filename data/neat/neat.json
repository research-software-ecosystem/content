A first set of tools supports basic operations on graphs (comparison between two graphs, neighborhood of a set of input nodes, path finding and graph randomization). Another set of programs makes the connection between networks and clusters (graph-based clustering, cliques discovery and mapping of clusters onto a network). The toolbox also includes programs for detecting significant intersections between clusters/classes (e.g. clusters of co-expression versus functional classes of genes). NeAT are designed to cope with large datasets and provide a flexible toolbox for analyzing biological networks stored in various databases (protein interactions, regulation and metabolism) or obtained from high-throughput experiments (two-hybrid, mass-spectrometry and microarrays). The web interface interconnects the programs in predefined analysis flows, enabling to address a series of questions about networks of interest. Each tool can also be used separately by entering custom data for a specific analysis. NeAT can also be used as web services (SOAP/WSDL interface), in order to design programmatic workflows and integrate them with other available resources.", "citationCount": 63, "authors": [{"name": "Brohee S."}, {"name": "Faust K."}, {"name": "Lima-Mendez G."}, {"name": "Sand O."}, {"name": "Janky R."}, {"name": "Vanderstocken G."}, {"name": "Deville Y."}, {"name": "van Helden J."}], "date": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Sylvain Broh\u00e9e", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sylvain@bigre.ulb.ac.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:neat", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rsat.sb-roscoff.fr/index_neat.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein interaction network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0276"}, {"term": "Pathway or network visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}, {"term": "Pathway or network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}, {"term": "Gene expression correlation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3463"}, {"term": "Weighted correlation network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3766"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-14T15:38:21Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Suite of tools for the analysis of biological networks, clusters, classes and pathways.
