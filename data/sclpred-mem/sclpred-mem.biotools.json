Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.The knowledge of the subcellular location of a protein is a valuable source of information in genomics, drug design, and various other theoretical and analytical perspectives of bioinformatics. Due to the expensive and time-consuming nature of experimental methods of protein subcellular location determination, various computational methods have been developed for subcellular localization prediction. We introduce “SCLpred-MEM,” an ab initio protein subcellular localization predictor, powered by an ensemble of Deep N-to-1 Convolutional Neural Networks (N1-NN) trained and tested on strict redundancy reduced datasets. SCLpred-MEM is available as a web-server predicting query proteins into two classes, membrane and non-membrane proteins. SCLpred-MEM achieves a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.52 on a strictly homology-reduced independent test set and 0.62 on a less strict homology reduced independent test set, surpassing or matching other state-of-the-art subcellular localization predictors.",
