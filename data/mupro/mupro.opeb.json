We use support vector machines to predict protein stability changes for single amino acid mutations leveraging both sequence and structural information. We evaluate our approach using cross-validation methods on a large dataset of single amino acid mutations. When only the sign of stability changes is considered, the predictive method achieves 84% accuracy-a significant improvement over previously published results. Moreover, the experimental results show that the prediction accuracy obtained using sequence alone is close to the accuracy obtained using tertiary structure information. Because our method can accurately predict protein stability changes using primary sequence information only, it is applicable to manty situations where the tertiary structure is unknown, overcoming a major limitations of previous methods which require tertiary information. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","authors":["Cheng J.","Randall A.","Baldi P."],"cit_count":341,"journal":"Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics","pmid":"16372356","title":"Prediction of protein stability changes for single-site mutations using support vector machines","year":"2006-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mupro","biotoolsID":"mupro","description":"Set of machine learning programs to predict how single-site amino acid mutation affects protein stability.
