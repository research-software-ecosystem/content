Consequently, accurate prediction of signal peptides and their cleavage sites is an important task in molecular biology. In the present study, firstly, we develop a novel discriminative scoring method for classifying proteins with or without signal peptides. This method successfully captured the characteristics of signal peptides and non-signal peptides by integrating hydrophobicity alignment and positionspecific amino acid propensities based on the highest average positions. As a result, this method is capable of discriminating proteins with signal peptides at the overall accuracies of 96.3%, 97.0% and 97.2% by leave-one-out jackknife tests on the constructed benchmark datasets for three different organisms, i.e. Eukaryotic, Gram-negative, and Gram-positive respectively. Secondly, we consider the prediction task of signal peptide cleavage sites as a sequence labeling problem and apply Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) algorithm to solve it. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CRFs-based cleavage site finding approach can achieve the prediction success rates of 80.8%, 89.4%, and 74.0% respectively, for the secretory proteins from three different organisms.
