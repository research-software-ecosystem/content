Expression levels of known relevant genes (specified by the user) are used to discover additional genes with similar expression patterns in large compendia of microarray data.  By carefully defining the lists of relevant genes, the user controls the specificity of discoveries.",

                "abstract": "PILGRM (the platform for interactive learning by genomics results mining) puts advanced supervised analysis techniques applied to enormous gene expression compendia into the hands of bench biologists. This flexible system empowers its users to answer diverse biological questions that are often outside of the scope of common databases in a data-driven manner. This capability allows domain experts to quickly and easily generate hypotheses about biological processes, tissues or diseases of interest. Specifically PILGRM helps biologists generate these hypotheses by analyzing the expression levels of known relevant genes in large compendia of microarray data. Because PILGRM is data-driven, it complements a user's knowledge and literature analysis with mining of diverse functional genomic data, thereby generating novel predictions that can drive experimental follow-up. This server is free, does not require registration and is available for use at http://pilgrm.princeton.edu. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).",
