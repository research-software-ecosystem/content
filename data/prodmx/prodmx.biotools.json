                "abstract": "© 2020Large-scale protein analysis has been used to characterize large numbers of proteins across numerous species. One of the applications is to use as a high-throughput screening method for pathogenicity of genomes. Unlike sequence homology methods, protein comparison at a functional level provides us with a unique opportunity to classify proteins, based on their functional structures without dealing with sequence complexity of distantly related species. Protein functions can be abstractly described by a set of protein functional domains, such as PfamA domains; a set of genomes can then be mapped to a matrix, with each row representing a genome, and the columns representing the presence or absence of a given functional domain. However, a powerful tool is needed to analyze the large sparse matrices generated by millions of genomes that will become available in the near future. The ProdMX is a tool with user-friendly utilities developed to facilitate high-throughput analysis of proteins with an ability to be included as an effective module in the high-throughput pipeline. The ProdMX employs a compressed sparse matrix algorithm to reduce computational resources and time used to perform the matrix manipulation during functional domain analysis. The ProdMX is a free and publicly available Python package which can be installed with popular package mangers such as PyPI and Conda, or with a standard installer from source code available on the ProdMX GitHub repository at https://github.com/visanuwan/prodmx.",
