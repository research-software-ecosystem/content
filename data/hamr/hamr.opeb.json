These modifications change the structure, function, and catalytic activity of RNAs, forming a layer of posttranscriptional regulation termed the epitranscriptome. Recent advances in high-throughput mapping have demonstrated these modifications are abundant and mark nearly all classes of RNAs, including messenger RNAs. Here, we outline one such technique called high-throughput annotation of modified ribonucleotides (HAMR). HAMR exploits the tendency of certain modified ribonucleotides to interfere with base pairing, leading to errors in complementary DNA synthesis during RNA sequencing library preparation. In total, we present a computational protocol for in silico identification of modifications with HAMR, which can be retroactively applied to a variety of RNA sequencing techniques.","authors":["Vandivier L.E.","Anderson Z.D.","Gregory B.D."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-8808-2_4","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","pmid":"30539546","title":"HAMR: High-throughput annotation of modified ribonucleotides","type":"Primary","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:HAMR","biotoolsID":"HAMR","description":"HAMR (High-throughput Annotation of Modified Ribonucleotides) - web application that allows you to detect and classify modified nucleotides in RNA-seq data.","homepage":"http://tesla.pcbi.upenn.edu/hamr/","name":"HAMR","version":["1.2"]}}
