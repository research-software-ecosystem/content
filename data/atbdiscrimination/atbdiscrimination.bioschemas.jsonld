They are at a high risk progression to active tuberculosis (ATB) during their lifetime, so it is urgent and vital to develop diagnostic methods that can distinguish ATB from latent tuberculosis infection.\n\nPlease input single sample data in the text form:.\n\nPlease Cite: Jiangpeng Wu, Jun Bai, Wei Wang, Lili Xi, Pengyi Zhang, Jingfeng Lan, Liansheng Zhang*, Shuyan Li*.
