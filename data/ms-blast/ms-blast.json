The identification was carried out by successively searching a sequence database - first with a peptide mass fingerprint, then with a packet of noninterpreted MS/MS spectra, and finally with peptide sequences obtained by automated interpretation of the MS/MS spectra. A \"MS BLAST\" homology searching protocol was developed to overcome specific limitations imposed by mass spectrometric data, such as the limited accuracy of de novo sequence predictions. This approach was tested in a small-scale proteomic project involving the identification of 15 bands of gel-separated proteins from the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, whose genome has not yet been sequenced and which is only distantly related to other fungi.", "citationCount": 500, "authors": [{"name": "Shevchenko A."}, {"name": "Sunyaev S."}, {"name": "Loboda A."}, {"name": "Shevchenko A."}, {"name": "Bork P."}, {"name": "Ens W."}, {"name": "Standing K.G."}], "date": "2001-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Analytical Chemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/genetics/labs/Sunyaev/index.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "iadzhubey@rics.bwh.harvard.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ms-blast", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/msblast/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Local alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-22T12:34:12Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Specialised BLAST \u2013based protocol developed for identification of proteins by sequence similarity searches using peptide sequences produced by the interpretation of tandem mass spectra.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/ms-blast-mass-spectrometry-driven-blast.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "ms-blast", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:50:07Z", "name": "MS-BLAST", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/msblast/MS_BLAST_TIPS.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
