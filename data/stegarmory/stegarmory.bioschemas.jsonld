StegArmory currently supports least significant bit (LSB) and pixel value differencing (PVD) encoding techniques. StegArmory was meant to embed and extract/execute shellcode payloads from images, though time-constraints didn't allow that feature of the project to be fully developed - this is left as an exercise for the user.",
