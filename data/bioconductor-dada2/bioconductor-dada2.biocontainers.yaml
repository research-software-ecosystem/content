description: The dada2 package provides functionality, but instead of picking otus
  the dada2 algorithm exactly infers samples sequences. the dada2 pipeline starts
  from demultiplexed fastq files, and outputs inferred sample sequences and associated
  abundances after removing substitution and chimeric errors. taxonomic classification
  is also available via a native implementation of the rdp classifier method.
