    "description": "A consensus Gene-disease Event Extraction System based on frequency patterns and supervised learning.\n\nAbstract Motivation The genetic mechanisms involved in human diseases are fundamental in biomedical research. Several databases with curated associations between genes and diseases have emerged in the last decades. Although, due to the demanding and time consuming nature of manual curation of literature, they still lack large amounts of information. Current automatic approaches extract associations by considering each abstract or sentence independently. This approach could potentially lead to contradictions between individual cases. Therefore, there is a current need for automatic strategies that can provide a literature consensus of gene-disease associations, and are not prone to making contradictory predictions",
