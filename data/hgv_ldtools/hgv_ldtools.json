Within candidate genes, the number of common polymorphisms is finite, but direct assay of all existing common polymorphism is inefficient, because genotypes at many of these sites are strongly correlated. Thus, it is not necessary to assay all common variants if the patterns of allelic association between common variants can be described. We have developed an algorithm to select the maximally informative set of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) to assay in candidate-gene association studies, such that all known common polymorphisms either are directly assayed or exceed a threshold level of association with a tagSNP. The algorithm is based on the r2 linkage disequilibrium (LD) statistic, because r2 is directly related to statistical power to detect disease associations with unassayed sites. We show that, at a relatively stringent r2 threshold (r2 > 0.8), the LD-selected tagSNPs resolve >80% of all haplotypes across a set of 100 candidate genes, regardless of recombination, and tag specific haplotypes and clades of related haplotypes in nonrecombinant regions. Thus, if the patterns of common variation are described for a candidate gene, analysis of the tagSNP set can comprehensively interrogate for main effects from common functional variation. We demonstrate that, although common variation tends to be shared between populations, tagSNPs should be selected separately for populations with different ancestries.", "citationCount": 1254, "authors": [{"name": "Carlson C.S."}, {"name": "Eberle M.A."}, {"name": "Rieder M.J."}, {"name": "Yi Q."}, {"name": "Kruglyak L."}, {"name": "Nickerson D.A."}], "date": "2004-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/nar/gkw343", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update", "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.", "citationCount": 523, "authors": [{"name": "Afgan E."}, {"name": "Baker D."}, {"name": "van den Beek M."}, {"name": "Blankenberg D."}, {"name": "Bouvier D."}, {"name": "Cech M."}, {"name": "Chilton J."}, {"name": "Clements D."}, {"name": "Coraor N."}, {"name": "Eberhard C."}, {"name": "Gruning B."}, {"name": "Guerler A."}, {"name": "Hillman-Jackson J."}, {"name": "Von Kuster G."}, {"name": "Rasche E."}, {"name": "Soranzo N."}, {"name": "Turaga N."}, {"name": "Taylor J."}, {"name": "Nekrutenko A."}, {"name": "Goecks J."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}, {"doi": "10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": null}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Galaxy Support Team", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "galaxy@pasteur.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hgv_ldtools-ip", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.0.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/tools", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "TSV", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Data handling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}, {"term": "Linkage disequilibrium calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0488"}, {"term": "Variant pattern analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3504"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "TSV", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-20T08:24:17Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool can be used to analyze the patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between polymorphic sites in a locus.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["ELIXIR-EE"]}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/tool_runner?tool_id=hgv_ldtools", "note": null, "type": "Galaxy service"}], "biotoolsID": "hgv_ldtools", "additionDate": "2016-12-19T14:30:23Z", "name": "hgv_ldtools", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/root?tool_id=hgv_ldtools", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
