It is based on the RxNorm drug terminology maintained by the U. S. National Library of Medicine, and on the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest ontology. Both national drug codes (NDCs) and RxNorm unique concept identifiers (RXCUIS) can undergo changes over time that can obfuscate their meaning when these identifiers occur in historic data","homepage":"http://purl.org/dron/identifiers/dron-identifiers.owl","name":"DrOn"}}
