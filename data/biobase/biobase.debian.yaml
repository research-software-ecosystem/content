description: "Biobase is part of the Bioconductor project, and is used by many other\
  \ packages. Biobase contains standardized data structures to represent genomic data,\
  \ and functions that are needed by many other packages or which replace R functions.\
  \ . Bioconductor is a project to develop innovative software tools for use in computational\
  \ biology. It is based on the R language. You should already be quite familiar with\
  \ R before using Bioconductor. Bioconductor packages provide flexible interactive\
  \ tools for carrying out a number of different computational tasks.\n"
