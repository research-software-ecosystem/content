summary: base functions for Bioconductor
description: >
   Biobase is part of the Bioconductor project, and is used by many other
   packages. Biobase contains standardized data structures to represent genomic
   data, and functions that are needed by many other packages or which replace R
   functions.
   .
   Bioconductor is a project to develop innovative software tools for use in
   computational biology. It is based on the R language. You should already be
   quite familiar with R before using Bioconductor. Bioconductor packages provide
   flexible interactive tools for carrying out a number of different computational
   tasks.
