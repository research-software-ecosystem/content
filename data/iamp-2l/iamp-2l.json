According to their special functions, AMPs are generally classified into ten categories: Antibacterial Peptides, Anticancer/tumor Peptides, Antifungal Peptides, Anti-HIV Peptides, Antiviral Peptides, Antiparasital Peptides, Anti-protist Peptides, AMPs with Chemotactic Activity, Insecticidal Peptides, and Spermicidal Peptides. Given a query peptide, how can we identify whether it is an AMP or non-AMP? If it is, can we identify which functional type or types it belong to? Particularly, how can we deal with the multi-type problem since an AMP may belong to two or more functional types? To address these problems, which are obviously very important to both basic research and drug development, a multi-label classifier was developed based on the pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) and fuzzy K-nearest neighbor (FKNN) algorithm, where the components of PseAAC were featured by incorporating five physicochemical properties. The novel classifier is called iAMP-2L, where \"2L\" means that it is a 2-level predictor. The 1st-level is to answer the 1st question above, while the 2nd-level is to answer the 2nd and 3rd questions that are beyond the reach of any existing methods in this area.
