  "sc:description": "This tool find matches of PSSM in large databases. Our approach preprocesses the search space and builds an enhanced suffix array which is stored on file. Since ESAsearch benefits from small alphabets, we present a variant operating on sequences recoded according to a reduced alphabet. We also address the problem of non-comparable PSSM-scores by developing a method which allows to efficiently compute a matrix similarity threshold for a PSSM, given an E-value or a P-value.",
