  "http://schema.org/description": "Set of KNIME workflows for the training of a deep learning model for image-classification with custom images and classes.\nThe workflows take ground-truth category annotations as a table generated by the qualitative annotations plugins in Fiji.\nWorkflows for the training of a model AND for the prediction of image-category for new images are provided.\nThere are different workflows if you do:\n- binary image-classification (images get classified in 1 category out of 2 possible categories) \n- classification from possibly more than 2 categories (images are classified in 1 category out of N possible categories).\nThe training workflows take care of image pre-processing and allows the visualization of the training and validation losses in real time along the training.  \nFor the training, transfer learning from a pre-trained VGG16 base is performed, with freshly initialized fully connected layers.\nOnly the fully connected layers are trained, the VGG16 base is frozen is this workflow, but once the fully connected layers trained the base could also be finetuned. In practice, it often works well with the frozen base.\n",
