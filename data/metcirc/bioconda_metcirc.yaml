description: MetCirc comprises a workflow to interactively explore high-resolution
  MS/MS metabolomics data. MetCirc uses the Spectrum2 and Spectra infrastructure defined
  in the package MSnbase that stores MS/MS spectra. MetCirc offers functionality to
  calculate similarity between precursors based on the normalised dot product, neutral
  losses or user-defined functions and visualise similarities in a circular layout.
  Within the interactive framework the user can annotate MS/MS features based on their
  similarity to (known) related MS/MS features.
