In many of these studies, tree nodes and branches need to be associated (or annotated) with various attributes. For example, in studies concerned with organismal relationships, tree nodes are associated with taxonomic names, whereas tree branches have lengths and oftentimes support values. Gene trees used in comparative genomics or phylogenomics are usually annotated with taxonomic information, genome-related data, such as gene names and functional annotations, as well as events such as gene duplications, speciations, or exon shufflings, combined with information related to the evolutionary tree itself. The data standards currently used for evolutionary trees have limited capacities to incorporate such annotations of different data types. Results: We developed a XML language, named phyloXML, for describing evolutionary trees, as well as various associated data items. PhyloXML provides elements for commonly used items, such as branch lengths, support values, taxonomic names, and gene names and identifiers. By using \"property\" elements, phyloXML can be adapted to novel and unforeseen use cases. We also developed various software tools for reading, writing, conversion, and visualization of phyloXML formatted data. Conclusion: PhyloXML is an XML language defined by a complete schema in XSD that allows storing and exchanging the structures of evolutionary trees as well as associated data. More information about phyloXML itself, the XSD schema, as well as tools implementing and supporting phyloXML, is available at http://www.phyloxml.org. \u00a9 2009 Han and Zmasek; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 280, "authors": [{"name": "Han M.V."}, {"name": "Zmasek C.M."}], "date": "2009-10-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Tan Jie", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "biosoftcn@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:archaeopteryx", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://en.bio-soft.net/tree/ATV.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Phylogenetic tree annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0558"}, {"term": "Phylogenetic tree editing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0326"}, {"term": "Phylogenetic tree analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0324"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Archaeopteryx is a software tool for the visualization, analysis, and editing of potentially large and highly annotated phylogenetic trees.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java", "Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "archaeopteryx", "additionDate": "2017-05-01T17:08:42Z", "name": "Archaeopteryx", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
