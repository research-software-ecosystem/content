Motivation: Synthetic biology is typified by developing novel genetic constructs from the assembly of reusable synthetic DNA parts, which contain one or more features such as promoters, ribosome binding sites, coding sequences and terminators. PartsGenie is introduced to facilitate the computational design of such synthetic biology parts, bridging the gap between optimization tools for the design of novel parts, the representation of such parts in community-developed data standards such as Synthetic Biology Open Language, and their sharing in journal-recommended data repositories. Consisting of a drag-and-drop web interface, a number of DNA optimization algorithms, and an interface to the well-used data repository JBEI ICE, PartsGenie facilitates the design, optimization and dissemination of reusable synthetic biology parts through an integrated application.",
