They have been widely identified in the human genome. Pig is an important biomedical model for human health. Few studies have been performed to explore the enhancers in the pig genome. The human enhancer information may be useful to identify enhancers in the pig genome. In addition, the genetic background of pig traits could be useful to annotate human enhancers and diseases. Thus, in order to further study enhancers and their potential roles in human and pig, we developed a public database, ETph (Enhancers and their Targets in pig and human). ETph integrates the information on human enhancers, pig putative enhancers, target genes, pig QTL terms, human diseases, GO terms and the KEGG pathway. A total of 25 182 enhancers were identified in the pig genome using the human homology sequence information. Among them, 6232 high-confidence enhancers were used to build the ETph. ETph provides a convenient platform to search, browse and download data. Moreover, a web-based analytical tool was designed to visualize networks and topology graphs among pig putative enhancers, target genes, pig QTL traits and human diseases. ETph might provide a useful tool for researchers to investigate the genetic background of pig traits and human diseases. ETph is freely accessible at http://klab.sjtu.edu.cn/enhancer/.",
