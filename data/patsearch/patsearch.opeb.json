Detection of such cis-acting elements in genome-wide screenings may significantly contribute to genome annotation and comparative analysis as well as to target functional characterization experiments. We present here PatSearch, a flexible and fast pattern matcher able to search for specific combinations of oligonucleotide consensus sequences, secondary structure elements and position-weight matrices. It can also allow for mismatches/mispairings below a user fixed threshold. We report three different applications of the program in the search of complex patterns such as those of the iron responsive element hairpin-loop structure, the p53 responsive element and a promoter module containing CAAT-, TATA- and cap-boxes. PatSearch is available on the web at http://bighost.area.ba.cnr.it/BIG/PatSearch/.","authors":["Grillo G.","Licciulli F.","Liuni S.","Sbisa E.","Pesole G."],"cit_count":95,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"12824377","title":"PatSearch: A program for the detection of patterns and structural motifs in nucleotide sequences","year":"2003-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:patsearch","biotoolsID":"patsearch","description":"A pattern matcher that is able to search for specific combinations of oligonucleotide consensus sequences, secondary structure elements and position-weight matrices.","homepage":"http://itbtools.ba.itb.cnr.it/patsearch","name":"PatSearch"}}
