Based on our assumption that whole structural segments of ligands, GPCRs and G-proteins are essential to determine GPCR and G-protein coupling, various quantitative features were selected for ligands, GPCRs and G-protein complex structures, and those parameters that are the most effective in selecting G-protein type were used as feature vectors in the SVM. The main part of GRIFFIN includes a hierarchical SVM classifier using the feature vectors, which is useful for Class A GPCRs, the major family. For the opsins and olfactory subfamilies of Class A and other minor families (Classes B, C, frizzled and smoothened), the binding G-protein is predicted with high accuracy using the HMM. Applying this system to known GPCR sequences, each binding G-protein is predicted with high sensitivity and specificity (>85% on average). GRIFFIN (http://griffin.cbrc.jp/) is freely available and allows users to easily execute this reliable prediction of G-proteins. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 41, "authors": [{"name": "Yabuki Y."}, {"name": "Muramatsu T."}, {"name": "Hirokawa T."}, {"name": "Mukai H."}, {"name": "Suwa M."}], "date": "2005-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:griffin", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://griffin.cbrc.jp/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Transmembrane protein prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0269"}, {"term": "Transmembrane protein prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0269"}, {"term": "Protein feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}, {"term": "Transmembrane protein analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0270"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:40Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Uses a support vector machine and hidden markov model to predict G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and G-protein coupling selectivity.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "griffin", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T14:15:46Z", "name": "GRIFFIN", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
