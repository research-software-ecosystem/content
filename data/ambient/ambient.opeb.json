Many microarray studies have analysed transcriptomic data from a pathway perspective, for instance by testing for KEGG pathway enrichment in sets of upregulated genes. However, the increasing availability of species-specific metabolic models provides the opportunity to analyse these data in a more objective, system-wide manner.Results: Here we introduce ambient (Active Modules for Bipartite Networks), a simulated annealing approach to the discovery of metabolic subnetworks (modules) that are significantly affected by a given genetic or environmental change. The metabolic modules returned by ambient are connected parts of the bipartite network that change coherently between conditions, providing a more detailed view of metabolic changes than standard approaches based on pathway enrichment.Conclusions: ambient is an effective and flexible tool for the analysis of high-throughput data in a metabolic context. The same approach can be applied to any system in which reactions (or metabolites) can be assigned a score based on some biological observation, without the limitation of predefined pathways. A Python implementation of ambient is available at http://www.theosysbio.bio.ic.ac.uk/ambient. © 2013 Bryant et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Bryant W.A.","Sternberg M.J.E.","Pinney J.W."],"cit_count":9,"journal":"BMC Systems Biology","pmid":"23531303","title":"AMBIENT: Active Modules for Bipartite Networks - using high-throughput transcriptomic data to dissect metabolic response","year":"2013-03-25"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ambient","biotoolsID":"ambient","description":"The Active Modules for Bipartite Networks is a Python module that uses simulated annealing to find areas of a metabolic network (modules) that have some consistent characteristic.
