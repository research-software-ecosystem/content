However, existing web applications for DNA methylation analysis does not adequately address the need of experimental biologists, and many additional functions are often required. RESULTS:To facilitate DNA methylation analysis, we present the SMART (Shiny Methylation Analysis Resource Tool) App, a user-friendly and easy-to-use web application for comprehensively analyzing the DNA methylation data of TCGA project",
