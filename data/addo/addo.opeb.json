ADDO implements a mixed-model transformation to control for population structure and unequal relatedness that accounts for both additive and dominant genetic covariance among individuals, and decomposes single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects into additive, partial dominance, dominance and overdominance categories. A matrix multiplication approach is used to accelerate the computation: a genome scan on 20 million markers from 836 individuals takes about 8.5 hours with 10 CPUs.\n\nAdditivity and dominance are the major genetic components underlying variations in complex traits","homepage":"https://github.com/LeileiCui/ADDO","name":"ADDO"}}
