Genesis integrates various tools for microarray data analysis such as filters, normalization and visualization tools, distance measures as well as common clustering algorithms including hierarchical clustering, self-organizing maps, k-means, principal component analysis, and support vector machines. The results of the clustering are transparent across all implemented methods and enable the analysis of the outcome of different algorithms and parameters. Additionally, mapping of gene expression data onto chromosomal sequences was implemented to enhance promoter analysis and investigation of transcriptional control mechanisms.",
