In this paper, we present an interactive web server, MotifViz, for three motif discovery programs, Clover, Rover and Motifish, covering most available flavors of algorithms for achieving this goal. For comparison, we have also implemented the simple motif-matching program Possum. MotifViz provides uniform and intuitive input and output formats for all four programs.
