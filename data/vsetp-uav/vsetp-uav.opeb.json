Firstly, we introduce and we discuss the future development of the Virtual Simulation Experiment Teaching Platform for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (VSETP-UAV). It includes specific topics such as the &ldquo;Systems and function Design&rdquo;, teaching and learning strategies, and experimental methods. This study shows that VSETP-UAV expands the usual content and training methods related to RS education, and creates a good synergy between teaching and research.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.20944/PREPRINTS201912.0106.V1","name":"VSETP-UAV"}}
