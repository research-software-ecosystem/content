Published by Oxford University Press.As an important type of proteins, intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are related to many crucial biological functions. Accurate prediction of IDPs/IDRs is beneficial to the prediction of protein structures and functions. Most of the existing methods ignore the fully ordered proteins without IDRs during training and test processes. As a result, the corresponding predictors prefer to predict the fully ordered proteins as disordered proteins. Unfortunately, these methods were only evaluated on datasets consisting of disordered proteins without or with only a few fully ordered proteins, and therefore, this problem escapes the attention of the researchers. However, most of the newly sequenced proteins are fully ordered proteins in nature. These predictors fail to accurately predict the ordered and disordered proteins in real-world applications. In this regard, we propose a new method called RFPR-IDP trained with both fully ordered proteins and disordered proteins, which is constructed based on the combination of convolution neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). The experimental results show that although the existing predictors perform well for predicting the disordered proteins, they tend to predict the fully ordered proteins as disordered proteins. In contrast, the RFPR-IDP predictor can correctly predict the fully ordered proteins and outperform the other 10 state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on a test dataset with both fully ordered proteins and disordered proteins. The web server and datasets of RFPR-IDP are freely available at http://bliulab.net/RFPR-IDP/server.",
