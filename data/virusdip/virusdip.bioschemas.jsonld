      "sc:description": "Virus Data Integration Platform.\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a huge threat to human public health. Viral sequence data plays an important role in the scientific prevention and control of epidemics. A comprehensive virus database will be vital useful for virus data retrieval and deep analysis. To promote sharing of virus data, several virus databases and related analyzing tools have been created. Results To facilitate virus research and promote the global sharing of virus data, we present here VirusDIP, a one-stop service platform for archive, integration, access, analysis of virus data. It accepts the submission of viral sequence data from all over the world and currently integrates data resources from the National GeneBank Database (CNGBdb), Global initiative on sharing all influenza data (GISAID), and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)",
