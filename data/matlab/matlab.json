    "description": "MATLAB software for automated calculation of concentration of different compounds using extracted peak area from HPLC data file in pdf format.\n\nChromatograms represent a class of data difficult to process expeditiously due to the large number of intermediary steps necessary to translate peak detection to a concentration reading of a specific compound. This problem is further exacerbated by the different output file format in which instrument manufacturers present chromatographic data. Steps necessary to convert a detected peak to a concentration reading include identification of compound using retention time, extraction of corresponding peak area, and calculation of concentration of compound by using a calibration curve.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Shimadzu HPLC', 'chromatographic', 'Shimadzu', 'LabSolutions'",
