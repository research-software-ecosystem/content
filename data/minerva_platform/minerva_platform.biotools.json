                "abstract": "Our growing knowledge about various molecular mechanisms is becoming increasingly more structured and accessible. Different repositories of molecular interactions and available literature enable construction of focused and high-quality molecular interaction networks. Novel tools for curation and exploration of such networks are needed, in order to foster the development of a systems biology environment. In particular, solutions for visualization, annotation and data cross-linking will facilitate usage of network-encoded knowledge in biomedical research. To this end we developed the MINERVA (Molecular Interaction NEtwoRks VisuAlization) platform, a standalone webservice supporting curation, annotation and visualization of molecular interaction networks in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)-compliant format. MINERVA provides automated content annotation and verification for improved quality control. The end users can explore and interact with hosted networks, and provide direct feedback to content curators. MINERVA enables mapping drug targets or overlaying experimental data on the visualized networks. Extensive export functions enable downloading areas of the visualized networks as SBGN-compliant models for efficient reuse of hosted networks. The software is available under Affero GPL 3.0 as a Virtual Machine snapshot, Debian package and Docker instance at http://r3lab.uni.lu/web/minerva-website/. We believe that MINERVA is an important contribution to systems biology community, as its architecture enables set-up of locally or globally accessible SBGN-oriented repositories of molecular interaction networks. Its functionalities allow overlay of multiple information layers, facilitating exploration of content and interpretation of data. Moreover, annotation and verification workflows of MINERVA improve the efficiency of curation of networks, allowing life-science researchers to better engage in development and use of biomedical knowledge repositories.",

                "abstract": "Translational medicine is a domain turning results of basic life science research into new tools and methods in a clinical environment, for example, as new diagnostics or therapies. Nowadays, the process of translation is supported by large amounts of heterogeneous data ranging from medical data to a whole range of -omics data. It is not only a great opportunity but also a great challenge, as translational medicine big data is difficult to integrate and analyze, and requires the involvement of biomedical experts for the data processing. We show here that visualization and interoperable workflows, combining multiple complex steps, can address at least parts of the challenge. In this article, we present an integrated workflow for exploring, analysis, and interpretation of translational medicine data in the context of human health. Three Web services - tranSMART, a Galaxy Server, and a MINERVA platform - are combined into one big data pipeline. Native visualization capabilities enable the biomedical experts to get a comprehensive overview and control over separate steps of the workflow. The capabilities of tranSMART enable a flexible filtering of multidimensional integrated data sets to create subsets suitable for downstream processing. A Galaxy Server offers visually aided construction of analytical pipelines, with the use of existing or custom components. A MINERVA platform supports the exploration of health and disease-related mechanisms in a contextualized analytical visualization system. We demonstrate the utility of our workflow by illustrating its subsequent steps using an existing data set, for which we propose a filtering scheme, an analytical pipeline, and a corresponding visualization of analytical results. The workflow is available as a sandbox environment, where readers can work with the described setup themselves. Overall, our work shows how visualization and interfacing of big data processing services facilitate exploration, analysis, and interpretation of translational medicine data.",

Currently, there are three major competing layout-aware systems biology formats, but there are no software tools or software libraries supporting all of them. This complicates the management of molecular network layouts and hinders their reuse and extension. In this paper, we present a high-level overview of the layout formats in systems biology, focusing on their commonalities and differences, review their support in existing software tools, libraries and repositories and finally introduce a new conversion module within the MINERVA platform. The module is available via a REST API and offers, besides the ability to convert between layout-aware systems biology formats, the possibility to export layouts into several graphical formats. The module enables conversion of very large networks with thousands of elements, such as disease maps or metabolic reconstructions, rendering it widely applicable in systems biology.",

MINERVA is a web platform for visualization, exploration and management of molecular networks. Here, we introduce an extension to MINERVA architecture that greatly facilitates the access and use of the stored molecular network data. It allows to incorporate such data in analytical pipelines via a programmatic access interface, and to extend the platform's visual exploration and analytics functionality via plugin architecture. This is possible for any molecular network hosted by the MINERVA platform encoded in well-recognized systems biology formats. To showcase the possibilities of the plugin architecture, we have developed several plugins extending the MINERVA core functionalities. In the article, we demonstrate the plugins for interactive tree traversal of molecular networks, for enrichment analysis and for mapping and visualization of known disease variants or known adverse drug reactions to molecules in the network. Availability and implementation: Plugins developed and maintained by the MINERVA team are available under the AGPL v3 license at https://git-r3lab.uni.lu/minerva/plugins/.

It has been reported that some non-coplanar PCBs accumulate in the brains of female PD patients. To improve our understanding of the association between PCB exposure and PD risk we have applied whole transcriptome gene expression analysis in blood cells from 594 PCB-exposed subjects (369 female, 225 male). Interestingly, we observe that in females, blood levels of non-coplanar PCBs appear to be associated with expression levels of PD-specific genes. However, no such association was detected in males. Among the 131 PD-specific genes affected, 39 have been shown to display similar changes in expression levels in the substantia nigra of deceased PD patients. Especially among the down-regulated genes, transcripts of genes involved in neurotransmitter vesicle-related functions were predominant. Capsule: Plasma PCB levels are associated with gene expression changes in females only, resulting in brain-related genes changing in blood cells of healthy individuals exposed to PCBs.",
