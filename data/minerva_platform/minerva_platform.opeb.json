It has been reported that some non-coplanar PCBs accumulate in the brains of female PD patients. To improve our understanding of the association between PCB exposure and PD risk we have applied whole transcriptome gene expression analysis in blood cells from 594 PCB-exposed subjects (369 female, 225 male). Interestingly, we observe that in females, blood levels of non-coplanar PCBs appear to be associated with expression levels of PD-specific genes. However, no such association was detected in males. Among the 131 PD-specific genes affected, 39 have been shown to display similar changes in expression levels in the substantia nigra of deceased PD patients. Especially among the down-regulated genes, transcripts of genes involved in neurotransmitter vesicle-related functions were predominant. Capsule: Plasma PCB levels are associated with gene expression changes in females only, resulting in brain-related genes changing in blood cells of healthy individuals exposed to PCBs.","authors":["Bohler S.","Krauskopf J.","Espin-Perez A.","Gebel S.","Palli D.","Rantakokko P.","Kiviranta H.","Kyrtopoulos S.A.","Balling R.","Kleinjans J."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2019.04.005","journal":"Environmental Pollution","pmid":"30991279","title":"Genes associated with Parkinson's disease respond to increasing polychlorinated biphenyl levels in the blood of healthy females","type":"Usage","version":"13.1.1","year":"2019-07-01"},{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw667","pmcid":"PMC5408809","pmid":"27993782","type":"Usage","version":"10.0.3"},{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty489","pmcid":"PMC6247942","pmid":"29931246","type":"Usage","version":"12.1"},{"doi":"10.1038/s41540-018-0059-y","pmcid":"PMC5984630","pmid":"29872544","type":"Review","version":"11.0.9"},{"doi":"10.1093/bib/bby024","pmcid":"PMC6556900","pmid":"29688273","type":"Review","version":"11.0.9"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:MINERVA_Platform","biotoolsID":"MINERVA_Platform","description":"MINERVA (Molecular Interaction NEtwoRk VisuAlization) platform is a standalone webserver for visualization, exploration and management of molecular networks encoded in SBGN-compliant format, including files produced using CellDesigner or SBGN editors.
