Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: A massive number of bioinformatics applications require counting of k-length substrings in genetically important long strings. A k-mer counter generates the frequencies of each k-length substring in genome sequences. Genome assembly, repeat detection, multiple sequence alignment, error detection and many other related applications use a k-mer counter as a building block. Very fast and efficient algorithms are necessary to count k-mers in large data sets to be useful in such applications. Results: We propose a novel trie-based algorithm for this k-mer counting problem. We compare our devised algorithm k-mer Counter based on Multiple Burst Trees (KCMBT) with available all well-known algorithms. Our experimental results show that KCMBT is around 30% faster than the previous best-performing algorithm KMC2 for human genome dataset. As another example, our algorithm is around six times faster than Jellyfish2. Overall, KCMBT is 20-30% faster than KMC2 on five benchmark data sets when both the algorithms were run using multiple threads.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Mamun A.-A."}, {"name": "Pal S."}, {"name": "Rajasekaran S."}], "date": "2016-09-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Abdullah-Al Mamun", "url": "http://www.engr.uconn.edu/~abm12008/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "abdullah.am.cs@engr.uconn.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:kcmbt", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/abdullah009/kcmbt_mt", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "k-mer counting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3472"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Very fast multi-threaded k-mer counting algorithm.
