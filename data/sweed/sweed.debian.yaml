summary: assessment of SNPs for their evolutionary advantage
description: >
   Biological sequences are available in ever increasing abundance across
   ever larger populations for ever increasing fractions of the genome. This
   tool sorts the SNPs for their active or passive contribution to a genetic
   drift, i.e. to see particular sequences at a higher fraction over time.
