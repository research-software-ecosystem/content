    "description": "A theoretical explanation for Lewis\u2019s law and Aboav-Weaire\u2019s law.\n\nBackground: Lewis\u2019s law and Aboav-Weaire\u2019s law are two fundamental laws used to describe the topology of two-dimensional (2D) structures; however, their theoretical bases remain unclear. Methods: We used R package Conicfit software to fit ellipses based on the geometric parameters of polygonal cells with ten different kinds of natural and artificial 2D structures. Results: Our results indicated that the cells could be classified as ellipse\u2019s inscribed polygon (EIP) and that they tended to form ellipse\u2019s maximal inscribed polygon (EMIP). This phenomenon was named as ellipse packing. On the basis of the number of cell edges, cell area, and semi-axes of fitted ellipses, we derived and verified new relations of Lewis\u2019s law and Aboav-Weaire\u2019s law.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ellipse', 'packing', 'ellipse packing', 'Conicfit'",
