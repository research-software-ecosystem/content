                "abstract": "© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.From time course gene expression data, we may identify genes that modulate in a certain pattern across time. Such patterns are advantageous to investigate the transcriptomic response to a certain condition. Especially, it is of interest to compare two or more conditions to detect gene expression patterns that significantly differ between them. Time course analysis can become difficult using traditional differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis methods since they are based on pair-wise sample comparison instead of a series of time points. Most importantly, the related tools are mostly available as local Software, requiring technical expertise. Here, we present TimesVector-web, which is an easy to use web service for analysing time course gene expression data with multiple conditions. The web-service was developed to (1) alleviate the burden for analyzing multi-class time course data and (2) provide downstream analysis on the results for biological interpretation including TF, miRNA target, gene ontology and pathway analysis. TimesVector-web was validated using three case studies that use both microarray and RNA-seq time course data and showed that the results captured important biological findings from the original studies.",
