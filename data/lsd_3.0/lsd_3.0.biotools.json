                "abstract": "© 2019 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The leaf senescence database (LSD) is a comprehensive resource of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) and their corresponding mutants. Through manual curation and extensive annotation, we updated the LSD to a new version LSD 3.0, which contains 5853 genes and 617 mutants from 68 species. To provide sustainable and reliable services for the plant research community, LSD 3.0 (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/lsd/) has been moved to and maintained by the National Genomics Data Center at Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In the current release, we added some new features: (i) Transcriptome data of leaf senescence in poplar were integrated; (ii) Leaf senescence-associated transcriptome data information in Arabidopsis, rice and soybean were included; (iii) Senescence-differentially expressed small RNAs (Sen-smRNA) in Arabidopsis were identified; (iv) Interaction pairs between Sen-smRNAs and senescence-associated transcription factors (Sen-TF) were established; (v) Senescence phenotypes of 90 natural accessions (ecotypes) and 42 images of ecotypes in Arabidopsis were incorporated; (vi) Mutant seed information of SAGs in rice obtained from Kitbase was integrated; (vii) New options of search engines for ecotypes and transcriptome data were implemented. Together, the updated database bears great utility to continue to provide users with useful resources for studies of leaf senescence.",
