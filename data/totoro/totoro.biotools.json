Currently, there is a need for novel computational methods that facilitate the analysis and integration of increasing volume of available data. Results: In this paper, we present Totoro a new constraint-based approach that integrates quantitative non-targeted metabolomic data of two different metabolic states into genome-wide metabolic models and predicts reactions that were most likely active during the transient state. We applied Totoro to real data of three different growth experiments (pulses of glucose, pyruvate, succinate) from Escherichia coli and we were able to predict known active pathways and gather new insights on the different metabolisms related to each substrate. We used both the E. coli core and the iJO1366 models to demonstrate that our approach is applicable to both smaller and larger networks. Availability: Totoro is an open source method (available at https://gitlab.inria.fr/erable/totoro) suitable for any organism with an available metabolic model. It is implemented in C++ and depends on IBM CPLEX which is freely available for academic purposes.",
