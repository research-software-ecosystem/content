      "sc:description": "3D chromatin organization webserver is a 3D genome modeling engine for predicting structural variation-driven alterations of chromatin spatial structure in the human genome.\n\n3D genome organization plays a critical role in its functioning. Alterations of this organization caused by structural variants (SVs) may lead to changes in gene transcription or even to disease. The recent advent of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) based techniques such as ChIA-PET and Hi-C allows us to investigate genome spatial organization. The rising volume of sequencing data in turn enables highly accurate identification of structural variation. Combination of those two sources of information can reveal mechanisms of genome regulation.",
