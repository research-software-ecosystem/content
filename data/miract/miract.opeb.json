The mirAct web server (http://sysbio.ustc.edu.cn/software/mirAct) is a tool designed to investigate miRNA activity based on gene-expression data by using the negative regulation relationship between miRNAs and their target genes. mirAct supports multiple-class data and enables clustering analysis based on computationally determined miRNA activity. Here, we describe the framework of mirAct, demonstrate its performance by comparing with other similar programs and exemplify its applications using case studies. © 2011 The Author(s).","authors":["Liang Z.","Zhou H.","He Z.","Zheng H.","Wu J."],"cit_count":17,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21596785","title":"MirAct: A web tool for evaluating microRNA activity based on gene expression data","year":"2011-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:miract","biotoolsID":"miract","description":"Tool designed to investigate miRNA activity in gene expression data.
