However, differential proteomics and identification of peaks relevant for class separation remains challenging. Results: Here, we introduce a simple yet effective approach for identifying differentially expressed proteins using binary discriminant analysis. This approach works by data-adaptive thresholding of protein expression values and subsequent ranking of the dichotomized features using a relative entropy measure. Our framework may be viewed as a generalization of the 'peak probability contrast' approach of Tibshirani et al. (2004) and can be applied both in the two-group and the multi-group setting. Our approach is computationally inexpensive and shows in the analysis of a large-scale drug discovery test dataset equivalent prediction accuracy as a random forest. Furthermore, we were able to identify in the analysis of mass spectrometry data from a pancreas cancer study biological relevant and statistically predictive marker peaks unrecognized in the original study.", "citationCount": 10, "authors": [{"name": "Gibb S."}, {"name": "Strimmer K."}], "date": "2015-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Korbinian Strimmer", "url": "http://strimmerlab.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "k.strimmer@imperial.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:binda", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://strimmerlab.org/software/binda/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2945"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package implements functions for multi-class discriminant analysis using binary predictors, for corresponding variable selection, and for dichotomizing continuous data.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/binda-multi-class-discriminant-analysis-using-binary-predictors.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "binda", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:05:07Z", "name": "binda", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/binda/binda.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
