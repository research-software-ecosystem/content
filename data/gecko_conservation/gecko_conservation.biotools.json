    "description": "The software allows for the systematic detection of gene cluster conservation in a large number of genomes. The enhancement over the original Gecko tool is the use of set-distance based gene cluster models that allow for the detection of gene clusters with diverse conservation patterns including gaps and missing genes in cluster occurrences. It is also tolerant of errors in gene homology assignment.",

                "abstract": "Whole genome comparison based on gene order has become a popular approach in comparative genomics. An important task in this field is the detection of gene clusters, i.e., sets of genes that occur co-localized in several genomes. For most applications, it is preferable to extend this definition to allow for small deviations in the gene content of the cluster occurrences. However, relaxing the equality constraint increases the computational complexity of gene cluster detection drastically. Existing approaches deal with this problem by using simplifying constraints on the cluster definition and/or allowing only pairwise genome comparison. In this article, we introduce a cluster concept named median gene clusters that improves over existing models, present efficient algorithms for their computation and show experimental results on the detection of approximate gene clusters in multiple genomes. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",
