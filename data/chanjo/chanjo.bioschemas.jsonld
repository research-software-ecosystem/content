      "sc:description": "Chanjo is coverage analysis for clinical sequencing. It's implemented in Python with a command line interface that adheres to UNIX pipeline philosophy. Chanjo leverages Sambamba to annotate coverage and completeness for a general BED-file. The output can then easily to loaded into a SQL database that enables investigation of coverage across regions and samples. The database also works as an API to downstream tools like the Chanjo Coverage Report generator.",
