Good prioritization of the results is important, and this can be helped by a visualization framework that automatically integrates RNA data with known genomic features. Here we present chimeraviz, a Bioconductor package that automates the creation of chimeric RNA visualizations. The package supports input from nine different fusion-finder tools: deFuse, EricScript, InFusion, JAFFA, FusionCatcher, FusionMap, PRADA, SOAPfuse and STAR-FUSION. Availability and implementation: chimeraviz is an R package available via Bioconductor (https://bio conductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/chimeraviz.html) under Artistic-2.0. Source code and support is available at GitHub (https://github.com/stianlagstad/chimeraviz).","authors":["Lagstad S.","Zhao S.","Hoff A.M.","Johannessen B.","Lingjaerde O.C.","Skotheim R.I."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx329","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Chimeraviz: A tool for visualizing chimeric RNA","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:chimeraviz","biotoolsID":"chimeraviz","description":"Visualization tools for gene fusions.","homepage":"https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/chimeraviz.html","name":"chimeraviz","version":["1.6.0"]}}
