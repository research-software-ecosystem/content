Utilizing this enormous resource would require reducing its redundancy by similarity clustering. However, clustering hundreds of millions of sequences is impractical using current algorithms because their runtimes scale as the input set size N times the number of clusters K, which is typically of similar order as N, resulting in runtimes that increase almost quadratically with N. We developed Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales as N, independent of K. It can also cluster datasets several times larger than the available main memory. We cluster 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50% sequence identity, >1000 times faster than has been possible before. Linclust will help to unlock the great wealth contained in metagenomic and genomic sequence databases.","authors":["Steinegger M.","Soding J."],"cit_count":12,"doi":"10.1038/s41467-018-04964-5","journal":"Nature Communications","title":"Clustering huge protein sequence sets in linear time","type":"Method","year":"2018-12-01"},{"abstract":"© The Author(s) 2019.

MMseqs2 is open source GPL-licensed software implemented in C++ for Linux, MacOS, and (as beta version, via cygwin) Windows. The software is designed to run on multiple cores and servers and exhibits very good scalability. MMseqs2 can run 10000 times faster than BLAST. At 100 times its speed it achieves almost the same sensitivity. It can perform profile searches with the same sensitivity as PSI-BLAST at over 400 times its speed.\n\nMMseqs2 includes Linclust, the first clustering algorithm whose runtime scales linearly With Linclust we clustered 1.6 billion metagenomic sequence fragments in 10 h on a single server to 50% sequence identity.","homepage":"https://mmseqs.com","name":"MMseqs2"}}
