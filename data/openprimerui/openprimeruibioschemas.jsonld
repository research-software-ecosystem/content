  "sc:description": "A Shiny application providing methods for designing, evaluating, and comparing primer sets for multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Primers are designed by solving a set cover problem such that the number of covered template sequences is maximized with the smallest possible set of primers. To guarantee that high-quality primers are generated, only primers fulfilling constraints on their physicochemical properties are selected.",
