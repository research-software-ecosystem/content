        "description": "high-capacity magazines significantly increase fatality counts, and are becoming more prevalent.\n\nBackground: There has been disagreement in the literature regarding whether public mass shootings are becoming more frequent, or more deadly, and whether high-capacity magazine (HCM) weaponry is associated with increased fatalities. Objective: We examined the 85 non-felony- and non-gang-related mass shootings with at least four people shot and killed that occurred in public places between 1995 to 2018 to examine the frequency and deadliness of public mass shootings, as well as the role of HCM weaponry in fatalities. Findings: The per-capita rate of public mass shootings with at least four people killed has not significantly increased since 1995 (Negative Binomial linear regression p=0.20), but public mass shootings with at least six people killed have been increasing by 6.9% per year (p=0.01).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'mass shootings'",
