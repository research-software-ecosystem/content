  description: fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads
  long_description: " TopHat aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using
    the ultra\n high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the\n\
    \ mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons.\n TopHat is a collaborative
    effort between the University of Maryland\n Center for Bioinformatics and Computational
    Biology and the\n University of California, Berkeley Departments of Mathematics
    and\n Molecular and Cell Biology."
