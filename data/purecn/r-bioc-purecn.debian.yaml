  description: copy number calling and SNV classification using targeted short read
    sequencing
  long_description: " This package estimates tumor purity, copy number, and loss of\n\
    \ heterozygosity (LOH), and classifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) by\n\
    \ somatic status and clonality. PureCN is designed for targeted short read\n sequencing\
    \ data, integrates well with standard somatic variant detection\n and copy number\
    \ pipelines, and has support for tumor samples without\n matching normal samples.\n"
