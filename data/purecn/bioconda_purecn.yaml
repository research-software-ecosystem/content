description: This package estimates tumor purity, copy number, and loss of heterozygosity
  (LOH), and classifies single nucleotide variants (SNVs) by somatic status and clonality.
  PureCN is designed for targeted short read sequencing data, integrates well with
  standard somatic variant detection and copy number pipelines, and has support for
  tumor samples without matching normal samples.
