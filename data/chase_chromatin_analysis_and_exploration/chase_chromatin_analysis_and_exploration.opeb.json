Summary: We present ChAsE, a cross-platform desktop application developed for interactive visualization, exploration and clustering of epigenomic data such as ChIP-seq experiments. ChAsE is designed and developed in close collaboration with several groups of biologists and bioinformaticians with a focus on usability and interactivity. Data can be analyzed through k-means clustering, specifying presence or absence of signal in epigenetic data and performing set operations between clusters. Results can be explored in an interactive heat map and profile plot interface and exported for downstream analysis or as high quality figures suitable for publications.","authors":["Younesy H.","Nielsen C.B.","Lorincz M.C.","Jones S.J.M.","Karimi M.M.","Moller T."],"cit_count":11,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw382","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"ChAsE: Chromatin analysis and exploration tool","type":"Primary","year":"2016-11-01"},{"abstract":"In this design study, we present an analysis and abstraction of the data and tasks related to the domain of epigenomics, and the design and implementation of an interactive tool to facilitate data analysis and visualization in this domain. Epigenomic data can be grouped into subsets either by k-means clustering or by querying for combinations of presence or absence of signal (on/off) in different epigenomic experiments. These steps can easily be interleaved and the comparison of different workflows is explicitly supported. We took special care to contain the exponential expansion of possible on/off combinations by creating a novel querying interface. An interactive heat map facilitates the exploration and comparison of different clusters. We validated our iterative design by working closely with two groups of biologists on different biological problems. Both groups quickly found new insight into their data as well as claimed that our tool would save them several hours or days of work over using existing tools. © 2013 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2013 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","authors":["Younesy H.","Nielsen C.B.","Moller T.","Alder O.","Cullum R.","Lorincz M.C.","Karimi M.M.","Jones S.J.M."],"cit_count":10,"doi":"10.1111/cgf.12096","journal":"Computer Graphics Forum","title":"An interactive analysis and exploration tool for epigenomic data","type":"Method","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ChAsE_Chromatin_Analysis_and_Exploration","biotoolsID":"ChAsE_Chromatin_Analysis_and_Exploration","description":"ChAsE (Chromatin Analysis and Exploration) is a cross platform desktop application that provides an interactive graphical interface for analysis of epigenomic data.
