Results: We describe kMech, a Cellerator language extension that describes a suite of enzyme mechanisms. Each enzyme mechanism is parsed by kMech into a set of fundamental association-dissociation reactions that are translated by Cellerator into ordinary differential equations that are numerically solved by Mathematica\u2122. In addition, we present methods that use commonly available kinetic measurements to estimate rate constants required to solve these differential equations. \u00a9 The Author 2004.
