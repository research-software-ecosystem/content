                "abstract": "Motivation: As a first step toward the elucidation of the systems biology of complex biological systems, it was our goal to mathematically model common enzyme catalytic and regulatory mechanisms that repeatedly appear in biological processes such as signal transduction and metabolic pathways. Results: We describe kMech, a Cellerator language extension that describes a suite of enzyme mechanisms. Each enzyme mechanism is parsed by kMech into a set of fundamental association-dissociation reactions that are translated by Cellerator into ordinary differential equations that are numerically solved by Mathematica\u2122. In addition, we present methods that use commonly available kinetic measurements to estimate rate constants required to solve these differential equations. \u00a9 The Author 2004.
