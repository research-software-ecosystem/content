Results: We describe kMech, a Cellerator language extension that describes a suite of enzyme mechanisms. Each enzyme mechanism is parsed by kMech into a set of fundamental association-dissociation reactions that are translated by Cellerator into ordinary differential equations that are numerically solved by Mathematica™. In addition, we present methods that use commonly available kinetic measurements to estimate rate constants required to solve these differential equations. © The Author 2004.
