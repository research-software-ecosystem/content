  "sc:description": "The HCA method is based on the use of a bidimensional plot, called the HCA plot. The bidimensional plot is associated with an alpha helicoidal pitch (3.6 residue/turn, connectivity distance of 4) which has been shown to offer the best correspondence between clusters and regular secondary structures. Examination of the HCA plot of a protein sequence allow to easily identify globular regions from non globular ones and, in globular regions, to identify secondary structures.",
