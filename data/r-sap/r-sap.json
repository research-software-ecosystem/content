Currently available analysis tools are often not easily installed by the general biologist and most of them lack inherent parallel processing capabilities widely recognized as an essential feature of next-generation bioinformatics tools. We present here a user-friendly and fully automated RNA-Seq analysis pipeline (R-SAP) with built-in multi-threading capability to analyze and quantitate high-throughput RNA-Seq datasets. R-SAP follows a hierarchical decision making procedure to accurately characterize various classes of transcripts and achieves a near linear decrease in data processing time as a result of increased multi-threading. In addition, RNA expression level estimates obtained using R-SAP display high concordance with levels measured by microarrays. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Mittal V.K."}, {"name": "McDonald J.F."}], "date": "2012-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Vinay Mittal", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "vinaykmittal@gatech.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:r-sap", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.mcdonaldlab.biology.gatech.edu/r-sap.htm", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA-Seq analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3680"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "User-friendly and fully automated bioinformatics pipeline that analyzes and quantitates high-throughput RNA-Seq datasets.
