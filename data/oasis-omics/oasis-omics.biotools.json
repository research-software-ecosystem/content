    "description": "OASIS (Omics Analysis, Search & Information System) is an information system for analyzing, searching, and visualizing associations between phenotypes, genotypes, and other types of omics data (such as transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc.). It is designed to enable discovery by connecting to the thought processes of biological researchers in a way that allows them to search results from an initial GWAS (or other association study), ask follow-up questions, and get answers in real-time. OASIS accomplishes this with a web-based search system and a variety of real-time analysis tools including conditional & multi-covariate analysis, and real-time linkage disequilibrium (LD) calculations. On-demand visualizations are provided in the form of boxplots, histograms, LocusZoom & Haploview plots. The OASIS search reports contain a broad spectrum of annotation from Annovar and WGSA plus a variety of links to external resources such as gnomAD, GTEx, HaploReg, Roadmap, UCSC and NCBI.",
