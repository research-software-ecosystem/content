    "description": "A Novel Approach to Stroke Analysis During Swim Training Based on Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).\n\nIn a world where technology is assuming a pervasive role, sports sciences are also increasingly exploiting the possibilities opened by advanced sensors and intelligent algorithms. This paper focuses on the development of a convenient, practical, and low-cost system, SwimBIT, which is intended to help swimmers and coaches in performance evaluation, improvement, and injury reduction. Real-world data were collected from 13 triathletes (age 20.8 \u00b1 3.5 years, height 173.7 \u00b1 5.3 cm, and weight 63.5 \u00b1 6.3 kg) with different skill levels in performing the four competitive styles of swimming in order to develop a representative database and allow assessment of the system's performance in swimming conditions.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'swimmers coaches', 'swimmers', 'AHRS', 'coaches'",
