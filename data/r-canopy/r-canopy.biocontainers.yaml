description: A statistical framework and computational procedure for identifying the
  sub-populations within a tumor, determining the mutation profiles of each  subpopulation,
  and inferring the tumor's phylogenetic history. The input are  variant allele frequencies
  (VAFs) of somatic single nucleotide alterations  (SNAs) along with allele-specific
  coverage ratios between the tumor and matched normal sample for somatic copy number
  alterations (CNAs). These quantities can be directly taken from the output of existing
  software. Canopy provides a  general mathematical framework for pooling data across
  samples and sites to  infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that fall within
  CNA regions, Canopy infers their temporal ordering and resolves their phase.  When
  there are  multiple evolutionary configurations consistent with the data, Canopy
  outputs  all configurations along with their confidence assessment.
