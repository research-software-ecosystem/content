The rationale is to exploit both vertical and horizontal information of a multiple alignment in a well-balanced manner. This is in contrast to established methods such as profiles and profile hidden Markov models which focus on vertical information as they model the columns of the alignment independently and to family pairwise search which focuses on horizontal information as it treats given sequences separately. In our setting, we want to select from a given database of \"candidate sequences\" those proteins that belong to a given superfamily. In order to do so, each candidate sequence is separately tested against a multiple alignment of the known members of the superfamily by means of a new jumping alignment algorithm. This algorithm is an extension of the Smith-Waterman algorithm and computes a local alignment of a single sequence and a multiple alignment. In contrast to traditional methods, however, this alignment is not based on a summary of the individual columns of the multiple alignment. Rather, the candidate sequence is at each position aligned to one sequence of the multiple alignment, called the \"reference sequence.\" In addition, the reference sequence may change within the alignment, while each such jump is penalized. To evaluate the discriminative quality of the jumping alignment algorithm, we compare it to profiles, profile hidden Markov models, and family pairwise search on a subset of the SCOP database of protein domains. The discriminative quality is assessed by median false positive counts (med-FP-counts). For moderate med-FP-counts, the number of successful searches with our method is considerably higher than with the competing methods.","authors":["Spang R.","Rehmsmeier M.","Stoye J."],"cit_count":27,"journal":"Journal of Computational Biology","pmid":"12487762","title":"A novel approach to remote homology detection: Jumping alignments","year":"2002-12-01"},{"abstract":"Previously, we developed jumping profile hidden Markov model (jpHMM), a new method to detect recombinations in HIV-1 genomes. The jpHMM predicts recombination breakpoints in a query sequence and assigns to each position of the sequence one of the major HIV-1 subtypes. Since incorrect subtype assignment or recombination prediction may lead to wrong conclusions in epidemiological or vaccine research, information about the reliability of the predicted parental subtypes and breakpoint positions is valuable. For this reason, we extended the output of jpHMM to include such information in terms of 'uncertainty' regions in the recombination prediction and an interval estimate of the breakpoint. Both types of information are computed based on the posterior probabilities of the subtypes at each query sequence position. Our results show that this extension strongly improves the reliability of the jpHMM recombination prediction.

Here, we present an extension of jpHMM to analyze recombinations in viruses with circular genomes such as the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Sequence analysis of circular genomes is usually performed on linearized sequences using linear models. Since linear models are unable to model dependencies between nucleotides at the 5′-and 3′-end of a sequence, this can result in inaccurate predictions of recombination breakpoints and thus in incorrect classification of viruses with circular genomes. The proposed circular jpHMM takes into account the circularity of the genome and is not biased against recombination breakpoints close to the 5′-or 3′-end of the linearized version of the circular genome. It can be applied automatically to any query sequence without assuming a specific origin for the sequence coordinates. We apply the method to genomic sequences of HBV and visualize its output in a circular form. jpHMM is available online at http://jphmm.gobics.de for download and as a web server for HIV-1 and HBV sequences. © 2012 The Author(s).","authors":["Schultz A.-K.","Bulla I.","Abdou-Chekaraou M.","Gordien E.","Morgenstern B.","Zoulim F.","Deny P.","Stanke M."],"cit_count":28,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22600739","title":"JpHMM: Recombination analysis in viruses with circular genomes such as the hepatitis B virus","year":"2012-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:jphmm","biotoolsID":"jphmm","description":"Jumping Profile Hidden Markov Model (jpHMM) takes a HIV-1 or HBV genome sequence and uses a pre-calculated multiple alignment of the major HIV-1 or HBV subtypes to predict the phylogenetic breakpoints and HIV/HBV subtype of the submitted sequence.","homepage":"http://jphmm.gobics.de/","name":"jpHMM"}}
