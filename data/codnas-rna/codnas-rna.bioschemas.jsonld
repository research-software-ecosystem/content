      "sc:description": "CoDNaS-RNA is a database of the Conformational Diversity in the Native State of RNA molecules. Each entry in CoDNaS-RNA is a redundant collection of known structures of the same RNA molecule, which can be considered as alternative instances of the RNA structure in its native ensemble. The conformers are taken from the wwPDB and include structures solved by X-Ray Diffraction, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and cryo-Electron Microscopy. CoDNaS-RNA allows you to quantify the conformational diversity of a given RNA, compare the structures of selected conformers, retrieve site-specific interactions between RNA and bound polynucleotides or proteins, and get more data cross-referenced from external resources like RNAcentral.",
