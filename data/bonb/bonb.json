To fully capture the genetic biomarkers that jointly explain the heritability component of a disease, thus, all SNPs from a genome-wide association study should be analyzed simultaneously. Results: In this paper, we present Bag of Na\u00efve Bayes (BoNB), an algorithm for genetic biomarker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of genome-wide SNP data. BoNB is based on the Na\u00efve Bayes classification framework, enriched by three main features: bootstrap aggregating of an ensemble of Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers, a novel strategy for ranking and selecting the attributes used by each classifier in the ensemble and a permutation-based procedure for selecting significant biomarkers, based on their marginal utility in the classification process. BoNB is tested on the Wellcome Trust Case-Control study on Type 1 Diabetes and its performance is compared with the ones of both a standard Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm and HyperLASSO, a penalized logistic regression algorithm from the state-of-the-art in simultaneous genome-wide data analysis. Conclusions: The significantly higher classification accuracy obtained by BoNB, together with the significance of the biomarkers identified from the Type 1 Diabetes dataset, prove the effectiveness of BoNB as an algorithm for both classification and biomarker selection from genome-wide SNP data.Availability: Source code of the BoNB algorithm is released under the GNU General Public Licence and is available at http://www.dei.unipd.it/~sambofra/bonb.html. \u00a9 2012 Sambo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 16, "authors": [{"name": "Sambo F."}, {"name": "Trifoglio E."}, {"name": "Di Camillo B."}, {"name": "Toffolo G.M."}, {"name": "Cobelli C."}], "date": "2012-09-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ELIXIR-ITA-PADOVA", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Francesco Sambo", "url": "http://www.dei.unipd.it/~sambofra", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "francesco.sambo@dei.unipd.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bonb", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sysbiobig.dei.unipd.it/?q=Software#Bonb", "function": [{"note": "(BoNB) is a software for genetic marker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of case-control genome-wide SNP data.", "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genetic mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0282"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Software for genetic marker selection and subjects classification from the simultaneous analysis of genome-wide SNP data.
