It is thus a quick way of establishing possible genetic mechanisms of an expressed trait, not unlike a GWAS, but with the entire pan-genome rather than a core set of mutations.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become indispensable in human medicine and genomics, but very few have been carried out on bacteria. Here we introduce Scoary, an ultra-fast, easy-to-use, and widely applicable software tool that scores the components of the pan-genome for associations to observed phenotypic traits while accounting for population stratification, with minimal assumptions about evolutionary processes. We call our approach pan-GWAS to distinguish it from traditional, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based GWAS. Scoary is implemented in Python and is available under an open source GPLv3 license at https://github.com/AdmiralenOla/Scoary.","authors":["Brynildsrud O.","Bohlin J.","Scheffer L.","Eldholm V."],"cit_count":46,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-016-1108-8","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"Rapid scoring of genes in microbial pan-genome-wide association studies with Scoary","type":"Primary","year":"2016-11-25"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:scoary","biotoolsID":"scoary","description":"Pan-genome wide association studies and  is designed to take the gene_presence_absence.csv file from Roary as well as a traits file created by the user and calculate the assocations between all genes in the accessory genome (all genes that are present in i genomes where 1 < i < N) and the traits.
