CMNPD currently contains more than 31 000 chemical entities with various physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, standardized biological activity data, systematic taxonomy and geographical distribution of source organisms, and detailed literature citations. It is an integrated platform for structure dereplication (assessment of novelty) of (marine) natural products, discovery of lead compounds, data mining of structure-activity relationships and investigation of chemical ecology.",
