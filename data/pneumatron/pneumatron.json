    "description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | An automated pneumatic apparatus for estimating xylem vulnerability to embolism at high temporal resolution | Xylem vulnerability to embolism represents an important trait to determine species distribution patterns and drought resistance. However, estimating embolism resistance frequently requires time-consuming and ambiguous hydraulic lab measurements. Based on a recently developed pneumatic method, we present and test the \"Pneumatron\", a device that generates high time-resolution and fully automated vulnerability curves. Embolism resistance is estimated by applying a partial vacuum to extract air from an excised xylem sample, while monitoring the pressure change over time. Although the amount of gas extracted is strongly correlated with the percentage loss of xylem conductivity, validation of the Pneumatron was performed by comparison with the optical method for Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaves",
