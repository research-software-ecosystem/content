Physiomodel (http://www.physiomodel.org) is our reimplementation and extension of an integrative physiological model called HumMod 1.6 (http://www.hummod.org) using our Physiolibrary (http://www.physiolibrary.org). The computer language Modelica is well-suited to exactly formalize integrative physiology. Modelica is an equation-based, and object-oriented language for hybrid ordinary differential equations (http:// www.modelica.org). Almost every physiological term can be defined as a class in this language and can be instantiated as many times as it occurs in the body. Each class has a graphical icon for use in diagrams. These diagrams are self-describing; the Modelica code generated from them is the full representation of the underlying mathematical model. Special Modelica constructs of physical connectors from Physiolibrary allow us to create diagrams that are analogies of electrical circuits with Kirchhoff's laws. As electric currents and electric potentials are connected in electrical domain, so are molar flows and concentrations in the chemical domain; volumetric flows and pressures in the hydraulic domain; flows of heat energy and temperatures in the thermal domain; and changes and amounts of members in the population domain.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Matejak M."}, {"name": "Kofranek J."}], "date": "2015-11-04T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, EMBS"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Marek Matejak", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Contributor"], "name": "Marek Matejak", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": null, "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "matfyz.cz", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Marek Matej\u00e1k", "url": "http://www.physiolib.com", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "marek@matfyz.cz"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:physiolibrary", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.3.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.physiolibrary.org", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-01-13T00:30:03Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Free open-source Modelica library designed for modeling human physiology.
