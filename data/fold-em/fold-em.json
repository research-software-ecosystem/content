This hybrid approach to structure determination requires that an atomic resolution structure of each component, or a suitable homolog, is available. If neither is available, then the amount of structural information regarding that component is limited by the resolution of the cryo-EM map. However, even if a suitable homolog cannot be identified using sequence analysis, a search for structural homologs should still be performed because structural homology often persists throughout evolution even when sequence homology is undetectable, As macromolecules can often be described as a collection of independently folded domains, one way of searching for structural homologs would be to systematically fit representative domain structures from a protein domain database into the medium/low resolution cryo-EM map and return the best fits. Taken together, the best fitting non-overlapping structures would constitute a 'mosaic' backbone model of the assembly that could aid map interpretation and illuminate biological function.Result: Using the computational principles of the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), we have developed FOLD-EM-a computational tool that can identify folded macromolecular domains in medium to low resolution (4-15 \u00c5) electron density maps and return a model of the constituent polypeptides in a fully automated fashion. As a by-product, FOLD-EM can also do flexible multi-domain fitting that may provide insight into conformational changes that occur in macromolecular assemblies.Availability and implementation: FOLD-EM is available at: http://cs.stanford.edu/\u223cmitul/foldEM/, as a free open source software to the structural biology scientific community. \u00a9 2012 The Author.", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Saha M."}, {"name": "Morais M.C."}], "date": "2012-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://ai.stanford.edu/~mitul/contact.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:fold-em", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://ai.stanford.edu/~mitul/foldEM/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling (backbone)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0479"}, {"term": "Surface rendering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_1816"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Computational tool that can identify folded macromolecular domains in medium to low resolution (4-15 \u00c5) electron density maps and return a model of the constituent polypeptides in a fully automated fashion.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/fold-em-fully-automated-fold-recognition-electron-density-maps.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "fold-em", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:43:03Z", "name": "FOLD-EM", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://ai.stanford.edu/~mitul/foldEM/Testcase.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
