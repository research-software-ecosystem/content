Computational prediction of NES motifs is of great interest, but remains a significant challenge. We have developed a novel approach for amino acid motif searching that can be used for NES prediction. This approach, termed Wregex (weighted regular expression), combines regular expressions with a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), and has been implemented in a web-based, freely available, software tool. By making use of a PSSM, Wregex provides a score to prioritize candidates for experimental testing. Key features of Wregex include its flexibility, which makes it useful for searching other types of protein motifs, and its fast execution time, which makes it suitable for large-scale analysis. In comparative tests with previously available prediction tools, Wregex is shown to offer a good rate of true-positive motifs, while keeping a smaller number of potential candidates.", "citationCount": 19, "authors": [{"name": "Prieto G."}, {"name": "Fullaondo A."}, {"name": "Rodriguez J.A."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ehubio.es/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "info@ehubio.es"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:wregex", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://wregex.ehubio.es/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence motif recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0239"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Software tool for amino acid motif searching using weighted regular expression and regular expressions with a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/wregex-1-1-amino-acid-motif-searching.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "wregex", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:04:34Z", "name": "Wregex", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://ehubio.ehu.eus/wregex/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
