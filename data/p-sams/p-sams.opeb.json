Published by Oxford University Press.Summary: The Plant Small RNA Maker Site (P-SAMS) is a web tool for the simple and automated design of artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) and synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNAs (syn-tasiRNAs) for efficient and specific targeted gene silencing in plants. P-SAMS includes two applications, P-SAMS amiRNA Designer and P-SAMS syn-tasiRNA Designer. The navigation through both applications is wizard-assisted, and the job runtime is relatively short. Both applications output the sequence of designed small RNA(s), and the sequence of the two oligonucleotides required for cloning into 'B/c' compatible vectors. Availability and implementation: The P-SAMS website is available at http://p-sams.carringtonlab.org.","authors":["Fahlgren N.","Hill S.T.","Carrington J.C.","Carbonell A."],"cit_count":14,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26382195","title":"P-SAMS: A web site for plant artificial microRNA and synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNA design","year":"2015-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:p-sams","biotoolsID":"p-sams","description":"Web tool for the simple and automated design of artificial miRNAs (amiRNAs) and synthetic trans-acting small interfering RNAs (syn-tasiRNAs) for efficient and specific targeted gene silencing in plants.","homepage":"http://p-sams.carringtonlab.org/","name":"P-SAMS"}}
