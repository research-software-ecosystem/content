For protein comparisons, a variety of definitional, algorithmic and statistical refinements described here permits the execution time of the BLAST programs to be decreased substantially while enhancing their sensitivity to weak similarities. A new criterion for triggering the extension of word hits, combined with a new heuristic for generating gapped alignments, yields a gapped BLAST program that runs at approximately three times the speed of the original. In addition, a method is introduced for automatically combining statistically significant alignments produced by BLAST into a position-specific score matrix, and searching the database using this matrix. The resulting Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program runs at approximately the same speed per iteration as gapped BLAST, but in many cases is much more sensitive to weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities. PSI-BLAST is used to uncover several new and interesting members of the BRCT superfamily.", "citationCount": 52252, "authors": [{"name": "Altschul S.F."}, {"name": "Madden T.L."}, {"name": "Schaffer A.A."}, {"name": "Zhang J."}, {"name": "Zhang Z."}, {"name": "Miller W."}, {"name": "Lipman D.J."}], "date": "1997-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Documentor"], "name": "BioCatalogue", "url": "https://www.biocatalogue.org", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Project", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:psi-blast_rest", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/seqdb/confluence/display/WEBSERVICES/psiblast_rest", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence similarity search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0346"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence search results", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0857"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-22T12:36:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Position Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) refers to a feature of NCBI BLAST 2.0 in which a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profile is constructed from set of BLAST alignments.", "toolType": ["Web API"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://www.biocatalogue.org/services/3128", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "psi-blast_rest", "additionDate": "2015-08-03T09:35:36Z", "name": "PSI-BLAST API (EBI)", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/services/sss/psiblast_rest", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
