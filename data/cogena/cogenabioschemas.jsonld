  "sc:description": "Workflow for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis. It aims to discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for drug discovery and drug repositioning based on the workflow is proposed. Particularly, candidate drugs can be predicted based on the gene expression of disease-related data, or other similar drugs can be identified based on the gene expression of drug-related data.",
