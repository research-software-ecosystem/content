description: cogena is a workflow for co-expressed gene-set enrichment analysis. It
  aims to discovery smaller scale, but highly correlated cellular events that may
  be of great biological relevance. A novel pipeline for drug discovery and drug repositioning
  based on the cogena workflow is proposed. Particularly, candidate drugs can be predicted
  based on the gene expression of disease-related data, or other similar drugs can
  be identified based on the gene expression of drug-related data. Moreover, the drug
  mode of action can be disclosed by the associated pathway analysis. In summary,
  cogena is a flexible workflow for various gene set enrichment analysis for co-expressed
  genes, with a focus on pathway/GO analysis and drug repositioning.
