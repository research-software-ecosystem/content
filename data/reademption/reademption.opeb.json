Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: RNA-Seq has become a potent and widely used method to qualitatively and quantitatively study transcriptomes. To draw biological conclusions based on RNA-Seq data, several steps, some of which are computationally intensive, have to be taken. Our READemption pipeline takes care of these individual tasks and integrates them into an easy-to-use tool with a command line interface. To leverage the full power of modern computers, most subcommands of READemption offer parallel data processing. While READemption was mainly developed for the analysis of bacterial primary transcriptomes, we have successfully applied it to analyze RNA-Seq reads from other sample types, including whole transcriptomes and RNA immunoprecipitated with proteins, not only from bacteria but also from eukaryotes and archaea.","authors":["Forstner K.U.","Vogel J.","Sharma C.M."],"cit_count":44,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu533","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25123900","title":"READemption-a tool for the computational analysis of deep-sequencing-based transcriptome data","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:reademption","biotoolsID":"reademption","description":"READemption integrates the steps that are required to interpret and gain biological knowledge from RNA-Seq experiments in one tool and makes them accessible via a consistent command line interface.","homepage":"https://pythonhosted.org/READemption/","name":"READemption"}}
