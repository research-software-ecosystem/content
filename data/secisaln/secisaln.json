In eukaryotes, its co-translational recoding requires the presence of an RNA stem-loop structure, the SECIS element in the 3 untranslated region of (UTR) selenoprotein mRNAs. Despite little sequence conservation, SECIS elements share the same overall secondary structure. Until recently, the lack of a significantly high number of selenoprotein mRNA sequences hampered the identification of other potential sequence conservation. In this work, the web-based tool SECISaln provides for the first time an extensive structure-based sequence alignment of SECIS elements resulting from the well-defined secondary structure of the SECIS RNA and the increased size of the eukaryotic selenoproteome. We have used SECISaln to improve our knowledge of SECIS secondary structure and to discover novel, conserved nucleotide positions and we believe it will be a useful tool for the selenoprotein and RNA scientific communities. \u00a9 2009 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 28, "authors": [{"name": "Chapple C.E."}, {"name": "Guigo R."}, {"name": "Krol A."}], "date": "2009-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Charles Chapple", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Contributor"], "name": "Marco Mariotti", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": null, "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "Lab Roderic Guigo Group", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "crg.eu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Didac Santesmasses & Charles Chapple", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "didac.santesmasses@crg.eu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:secisaln", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://big.crg.cat/services/secisaln", "function": [{"note": "SECISaln will predict a eukaryotic SECIS element in a nucleotide sequence, split it into its structural units and then align each unit against the SECISes in our database.
