We believe that an I-Corps@NCATS program will enhance the process of scientific translation by taking best practices from NSF I-Corps and adapting the program to meet the needs of biomedical scientists in academic medical centers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NSF I-Corps', 'I-Corps', 'SBIR I-Corps'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6798670/","name":"I-CorpsaNCATS"}}
