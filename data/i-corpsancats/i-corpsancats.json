    "description": "Toward entrepreneurial training for clinical and translational investigators and lessons learned in team-based customer and stakeholder discovery.\n\nOBJECTIVES SPECIFIC AIMS: The goal of this abstract presentation is to share lessons learned from participation in the NIH SBIR I-Corps Train-The-Trainer Program, discuss our experiences offering programs at our local institutions, and communicate our plans to develop an I-Corps@NCATS program that can be disseminated across the CTSA network. We believe that an I-Corps@NCATS program will enhance the process of scientific translation by taking best practices from NSF I-Corps and adapting the program to meet the needs of biomedical scientists in academic medical centers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NSF I-Corps', 'I-Corps', 'SBIR I-Corps'",
