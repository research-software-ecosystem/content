The data input is in the format of whole-genome sequencing data which enables characterization of genomic alterations ranging in size from point mutations to entire chromosomes. High quality results are obtained even if samples have low coverage, low tumor cell content or are aneuploid. The first takes BAM files as input whereas CG takes input from CompleteGenomics files.",
