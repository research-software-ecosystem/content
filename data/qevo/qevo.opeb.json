We report our first experiences in a cadaveric study and a clinical case series using the new microinspection tool QEVO® that serves as a plug-in feature for the recently launched KINEVO 900 digital visualization platform (CARL ZEISS MEDITEC, Oberkochen, Germany). For illustration purposes, we offer video footage. Methods:The handling, workflow, and visualization patterns of the QEVO® microinspection tool were critically evaluated in cadaver specimens by simulating four standardized neurosurgical approaches: (1) pterional, (2) retrosigmoidal, (3) transsphenoidal, (4) and transcallosal","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31528384","name":"QEVO"}}
