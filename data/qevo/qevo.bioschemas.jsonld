      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A cadaveric study and first clinical experiences (case series) | Background:The use of endoscopes in neurosurgery is well established, but the integration of a full high definition signaling, 45° angled endoscopic tool into a digital surgical microscope, is new. We report our first experiences in a cadaveric study and a clinical case series using the new microinspection tool QEVO® that serves as a plug-in feature for the recently launched KINEVO 900 digital visualization platform (CARL ZEISS MEDITEC, Oberkochen, Germany). For illustration purposes, we offer video footage. Methods:The handling, workflow, and visualization patterns of the QEVO® microinspection tool were critically evaluated in cadaver specimens by simulating four standardized neurosurgical approaches: (1) pterional, (2) retrosigmoidal, (3) transsphenoidal, (4) and transcallosal",
