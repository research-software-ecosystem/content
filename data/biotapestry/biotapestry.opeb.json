Using BioTapestry, a researcher can-construct a network model and use it to visualize and understand the dynamic behavior of a complex, spatially and temporally distributed GRN. Here we provide a step-by-step example of a way to use BioTapestry to build a GRN model and discuss some common issues that can arise during this process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","authors":["Longabaugh W.J.R."],"cit_count":37,"journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","pmid":"21938637","title":"BioTapestry: A tool to visualize the dynamic properties of gene regulatory networks","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:biotapestry","biotoolsID":"biotapestry","description":"Interactive tool for building, visualizing, and simulating genetic regulatory networks.
