      "sc:description": "Integrating thermodynamic and sequence contexts improves protein-RNA binding prediction | This is a TensorFlow implementation accompanying our paper. This codebase is based on Shreshthgandhi's Tensorflow implementation of the cdeepbind model. The framework of model training and testing have beed adopted with minor changes. Other code files have been modified and re-structured with changes specific to our model. And the folder, scripts/RNAsubopt is a copy of RNAsubopt from the ViennaRNA project | We used two datasets to evaluate our model. The following datsets were used for training our models | You can download the datasets from the corresponding website. After that, you should prepare the data used in the training code according to the steps below. We use the CLIP-seq dataset as an example | BTW, The ThermoNet implementation is available at invitro bin deepbind_model utils_update.py",
