description: 'Sequencing and microarray samples often are collected or processed in
  multiple batches or at different times. This often produces technical biases that
  can lead to incorrect results in the downstream analysis. BatchQC is a software
  tool that streamlines batch preprocessing and evaluation by providing interactive
  diagnostics, visualizations, and statistical analyses to explore the extent to which
  batch variation impacts the data. BatchQC diagnostics help determine whether batch
  adjustment needs to be done, and how correction should be applied before proceeding
  with a downstream analysis. Moreover, BatchQC interactively applies multiple common
  batch effect approaches to the data, and the user can quickly see the benefits of
  each method. BatchQC is developed as a Shiny App. The output is organized into multiple
  tabs, and each tab features an important part of the batch effect analysis and visualization
  of the data. The BatchQC interface has the following analysis groups: Summary, Differential
  Expression, Median Correlations, Heatmaps, Circular Dendrogram, PCA Analysis, Shape,
  ComBat and SVA.'
