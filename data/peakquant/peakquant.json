To address this issue, a wide range of stable isotope labeling techniques have been developed, allowing one to quantitatively study thousands of proteins by means of mass spectrometry. In this article, the FindPairs module of the PeakQuant software suite is detailed. It facilitates the automatic determination of protein abundance ratios based on the automated analysis of stable isotope-coded mass spectrometric data. Furthermore, it implements statistical methods to determine outliers due to biological as well as technical variance of proteome data obtained in replicate experiments. This provides an important means to evaluate the significance in obtained protein expression data. For demonstrating the high applicability of FindPairs, we focused on the quantitative analysis of proteome data acquired in 14N/15N labeling experiments. We further provide a comprehensive overview of the features of the FindPairs software, and compare these with existing quantification packages. The software presented here supports a wide range of proteomics applications, allowing one to quantitatively assess data derived from different stable isotope labeling approaches, such as 14N/15N labeling, SILAC, and iTRAQ. The software is publicly available at http://www.medizinisches-proteom-center.de/software and free for academic use. \u00a9 Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Eisenacher M."}, {"name": "Kohl M."}, {"name": "Wiese S."}, {"name": "Hebeler R."}, {"name": "Meyer H.E."}, {"name": "Warscheid B."}, {"name": "Stephan C."}], "date": "2012-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Martin Eisenacher", "url": "http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mpc/index.html.en", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "martin.eisenacher@ruhr-uni-bochum.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:peakquant", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mpc/software/PeakQuant/index.html.de", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Spectral counting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"}, {"term": "Protein quantification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3630"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:29:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Serves as an integrated platform for several Proteomics tools and provides an easily operated graphical user interface.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/peakquant-proteomics-software-suit.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "peakquant", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:55:21Z", "name": "PeakQuant", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/mpc/software/PeakQuant/index.html.de", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
