description: Slncky is a tool for lncrna discovery from rna-seq data. slncky filters
  a high-quality set of noncoding transcripts, discovers lncrna orthologs, and characterizes
  conserved lncrna evolution. slncky was developed as a collaboration between the
  garber lab at umass medical and the regev lab at the broad institute.
