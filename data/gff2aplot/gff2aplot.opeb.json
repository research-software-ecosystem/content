The features to be displayed are highly customizable to meet user specific needs. The program serves to generate print-quality images for comparative genome sequence analysis.","authors":["Abril J.F.","Guigo R.","Wiehe T."],"cit_count":8,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btg334","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"gff2aplot: Plotting sequence comparisons","type":"Primary","year":"2003-12-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gff2aplot","biotoolsID":"gff2aplot","description":"Program to visualize the alignment of two sequences together with their annotations.
