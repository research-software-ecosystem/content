    "description": "A Gephi Plugin Towards Social Network Analysis of Network Exposure for Unipartite and Bipartite Graphs | Gephi plugin for network exposure models | NET-EXPO is a Gelphi plugin that computes various types of network exposure metrics for the purpose of visualization exposure within a network for analysis. Currently network exposure model (Marsden, et al. 1993, Burt, 1987, Valente, 1996, 2005), affiliation exposure model (Fujimoto, et al., 2011, 2012), and limited support for decomposition exposure model (Fujimoto, 2012, Fujimoto, et al., 2013) are supported",

                "abstract": "© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.Social network analysis (SNA) concerns itself in studying network structures in relation to individuals’ behavior. Individuals may be influenced by their network members in their behavior, and thus past researchers have developed computational methods that allow us to measure the extent to which individuals are exposed to members with certain behavior within one’s social network, and that be correlated with their own behavior. Some of these methods include network exposure model, affiliation exposure model, and decomposed network exposure models. We developed a Gephi plugin that computes and visualizes these various kinds of network exposure models called NET-EXPO. We experimented with NET-EXPO on some social network datasets to demonstrate its pragmatic use in social network research. This plugin has the potential to equip researchers with a tool to compute network exposures in a user friendly way and simplify the process to compute and visualize the network data.",
