summary: Tool set for molecular QTL discovery and analysis
description: >
   QTLtools is a tool set for molecular Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) discovery
   and analysis. It allows user to go from the raw sequence data to collection of
   molecular QTL in few easy-to-perform steps. QTLtools contains multiple methods
   to prepare the data, to discover proximal and distal molecular QTL and to
   finally integrate them with GWAS variants and functional annotations of the
   genome.
