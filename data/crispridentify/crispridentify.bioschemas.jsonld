      "sc:description": "CRISPRidentify is a tool to search for CRISPR arrays which utilises machine learning approach for distinguishing false candidates from true CRISPRS. CRISPRidentify, performs three steps: detection, feature extraction and classification based on manually curated sets of positive and negative examples of CRISPR arrays. The identified CRISPR arrays are then reported to the user accompanied by detailed annotation. We demonstrate that our approach identifies not only previously detected CRISPR arrays, but also CRISPR array candidates not detected by other tools. Compared to other methods, our tool has a drastically reduced false positive rate. In contrast to the existing tools, CRISPRidentify approach not only provides the user with the basic statistics on the identified CRISPR arrays but also produces a certainty score as an intuitive measure of the likelihood that a given genomic region is a CRISPR array.",
