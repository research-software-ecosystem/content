  "sc:description": "Model-based Analysis of 2-Color Arrays is a model-based algorithm for analyzing 2-color microarrays.A novel normalization method based on the GC content of probes is developed for two-color tiling arrays. The proposed method, together with robust estimates of the model parameters, is shown to perform superbly on published data sets. A robust algorithm for detecting peak regions is also formulated and shown to perform well compared to other approaches.",
