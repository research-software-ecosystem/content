Posterior computation in the logistic model is known to be computationally demanding due to its non-conjugacy with common priors. We combine a Polya-Gamma based data augmentation strategy and use recent results on Markov chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) techniques to develop an efficient and exact sampling strategy for the posterior computation. We use the resulting MCMC chain for model selection and choose the best combination(s) of genomic variables via posterior model probabilities",
