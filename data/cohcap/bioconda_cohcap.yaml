description: 'COHCAP (pronounced "co-cap") provides a pipeline to analyze single-nucleotide
  resolution methylation data (Illumina 450k/EPIC methylation array, targeted BS-Seq,
  etc.). It provides differential methylation for CpG Sites, differential methylation
  for CpG Islands, integration with gene expression data, with visualizaton options.
