Using a gene name from any of these organisms as a query, this database provides comprehensive, combined information on orthologs in other species using data from five independent resources: KOGs, Inparanoid, HomoloGene, OrthoMCL and a table of curated fission and budding yeast orthologs. Associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms of orthologs can also be retrieved for functional inference. Integrating these different and complementary datasets provides a straightforward tool to identify known and predicted orthologs of proteins from a variety of species. This resource should be useful for bench scientists looking for functional clues for their genes of interest as well as for curators looking for information that can be transferred based on orthology and for rapidly identifying the relevant GO terms as an aid to literature curation.
