However, few software applications are available for interpreting these experiments. We present here an efficient application for use with chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-Seq) experimental data that includes novel functionality for identifying areas of gene enrichment and transcription factor binding site locations, as well as for estimating DNA fragment size distributions in enriched areas. The FindPeaks application can generate UCSC compatible custom 'WIG' track files from aligned-read files for short-read sequencing technology. The software application can be executed on any platform capable of running a Java Runtime Environment. Memory requirements are proportional to the number of sequencing reads analyzed; typically 4 GB permits processing of up to 40 million reads. \u00a9 2008 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 205, "authors": [{"name": "Fejes A.P."}, {"name": "Robertson G."}, {"name": "Bilenky M."}, {"name": "Varhol R."}, {"name": "Bainbridge M."}, {"name": "Jones S.J.M."}], "date": "2008-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Anthony Fejes", "url": "https://sourceforge.net/u/apfejes/profile/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:findpeaks", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://vancouvershortr.sourceforge.net/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Peak calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3222"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0258"}, {"term": "Formatting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0335"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-01-29T12:07:41Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The Vancouver Short Read Analysis Package (VSRAP) contains the FindPeaks application for Chip-Seq and RNA-Seq analysis, as well as utilities for SNP finding, working with aligned sequence files and a nascent database for storing SNPs across multiple libraries.", "toolType": ["Suite"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["animalandcropgenomics"]}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "findpeaks", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:14:35Z", "name": "FindPeaks 4.0 (Vancouver Short Read Package)", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/vancouvershortr/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
