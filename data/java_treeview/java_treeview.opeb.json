Treeview is a popular application for the visualization of microarray data, but is closed-source and platform-specific, which limits both its current utility and suitability as a platform for further development. Java Treeview is an open-source, cross-platform rewrite that handles very large datasets well, and supports extensions to the file format that allow the results of additional analysis to be visualized and compared. The combination of a general file format and open source makes Java Treeview an attractive choice for solving a class of visualization problems. An applet version is also available that can be used on any website with no special server-side setup. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Saldanha A.J."],"cit_count":1788,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bth349","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"15180930","title":"Java Treeview - Extensible visualization of microarray data","type":"Primary","year":"2004-11-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:java_treeview","biotoolsID":"java_treeview","description":"Java TreeView is an enhanced, open source, cross-platform gene expression visualization tool.
