    "description": "a 2-dimensional solar cell modeling tool.\n\nOptoelectronic modeling in multiple dimensions.\n\nSesame is an open source drift-diffusion-Poisson solver in one and two dimensions. It can describe optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and LED's. Sesame is designed to easily model planar defects such as grain boundaries and sample surfaces.",

It supports 1 and 2-dimensional systems and provides tools to easily implement extended defects such as grain boundaries or sample surfaces. Sesame is designed to facilitate fast exploration of the system parameter space and to visualize local charge transport properties. Sesame has been benchmarked against other software packages, and results for single crystal and polycrystalline CdS-CdTe heterojunctions are presented. Sesame is distributed as a Python package or as a standalone GUI application, and is available at https://pages.nist.gov/sesame/.",
