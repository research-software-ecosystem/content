As reliable statistical analysis rests on reliable data, determining such quality is of the utmost importance. Quality measures to spot problematic samples exist, but they are platform-specific, and cannot be used to compare studies. Results: As a proxy for quality, we propose a signal-to-noise ratio for microarray data, the \"Signal-to-Noise Applied to Gene Expression Experiments\", or SNAGEE. SNAGEE is based on the consistency of gene-gene correlations. We applied SNAGEE to a compendium of 80 large datasets on 37 platforms, for a total of 24,380 samples, and assessed the signal-to-noise ratio of studies and samples. This allowed us to discover serious issues with three studies. We show that signal-to-noise ratios of both studies and samples are linked to the statistical significance of the biological results. Conclusions: We showed that SNAGEE is an effective way to measure data quality for most types of gene expression studies, and that it often outperforms existing techniques. Furthermore, SNAGEE is platform-independent and does not require raw data files. The SNAGEE R package is available in BioConductor. \u00a9 2012 Venet et al.", "citationCount": 10, "authors": [{"name": "Venet D."}, {"name": "Detours V."}, {"name": "Bersini H."}], "date": "2012-12-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "David Venet", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "davenet@ulb.ac.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:snagee", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.14.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SNAGEE.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Validation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"}, {"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Signal-to-Noise applied to Gene Expression Experiments.
