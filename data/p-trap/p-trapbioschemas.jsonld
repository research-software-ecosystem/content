  "sc:description": "It is a free and new open source software that automatically recognizes, from numeric images, the structure of a panicle and the seeds on the panicle. The software processes and quantifies several traits related to the structures of the panicles, detects and counts the grains, and measures their shape parameters. It offers both efficient results and friendly environment for users to perform their experiments. Manual processing is not repeatable because dry panicles are vulnerable to damage.",
