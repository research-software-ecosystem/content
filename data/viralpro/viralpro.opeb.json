Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Not only sequence data continue to outpace annotation information, but also the problem is further exacerbated when organisms are underrepresented in the annotation databases. This is the case with non-human-pathogenic viruses which occur frequently in metagenomic projects. Thus, there is a need for tools capable of detecting and classifying viral sequences. Results: We describe VIRALpro a new effective tool for identifying capsid and tail protein sequences, which are the cornerstones toward viral sequence annotation and viral genome classification.","authors":["Galiez C.","Magnan C.N.","Coste F.","Baldi P."],"cit_count":1,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26733451","title":"VIRALpro: A tool to identify viral capsid and tail sequences","year":"2016-05-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:viralpro","biotoolsID":"viralpro","description":"Predictor capable of identifying capsid and tail protein sequences using support vector machines (SVM) with an accuracy estimated to be between 90% and 97%.","homepage":"http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu","name":"VIRALpro"}}
