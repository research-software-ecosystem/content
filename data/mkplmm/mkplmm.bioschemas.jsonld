      "sc:description": "Multi-kernel linear mixed model with adaptive lasso for prediction analysis on high-dimensional multi-omics data.\n\nMOTIVATION:The use of human genome discoveries and other established factors to build an accurate risk prediction model is an essential step towards precision medicine. While multi-layer high-dimensional omics data provide unprecedented data resources for prediction studies, their corresponding analytical methods are much less developed. RESULTS:We present a multi-kernel linear mixed model with adaptive lasso (MKpLMM), a predictive modeling framework that extends the standard linear mixed models widely used in genomic risk prediction, for multi-omics data analysis. MKpLMM can capture not only the predictive effects from each layer of omics data but also their interactions via using multiple kernel functions.",
