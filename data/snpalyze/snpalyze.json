Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was applied to estimate LD and compared with other standard LD measures, D\u2032 and r2. By comparison of an independent model (IM; linkage equilibrium) and a dependent model (DM; linkage disequilibrium), the parsimonious model is the one with the smaller AIC score. Therefore, the extent of LD by AIC is expressed as AIC(IM) - AIC(DM)(AIC(LD)). A total of 39 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on a 1.6-Mb region of chromosome 21q22 were identified, and genotyped in 192 Japanese individuals. All possible pairs were analyzed to estimate LD and the analyses were compared. AIC(LD) became highly positive as the D\u2032 value increased and was negative at D\u2032 values of around 0.2. Because a negative value of AIC(LD) implies linkage equilibrium, D\u2032 values below 0.2 should be regarded as linkage equilibrium. The LD estimate by AIC yielded results similar to those obtained by r2, indicating that AIC(LD) would be useful for fine gene mapping.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Shimo-onoda K."}, {"name": "Tanaka T."}, {"name": "Furushima K."}, {"name": "Nakajima T."}, {"name": "Toh S."}, {"name": "Harata S."}, {"name": "Yone K."}, {"name": "Komiya S."}, {"name": "Adachi H."}, {"name": "Nakamura E."}, {"name": "Fujimiya H."}, {"name": "Inoue I."}], "date": "2002-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Human Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://www.dynacom.co.jp/english/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "info@dynacom.co.jp"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:snpalyze", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.dynacom.co.jp/english/snpalyze_e/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genotyping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3196"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool is able to import many specific types of Genotyping data files and analyze them.When case-control studies are analyzed, in addition to the columns with genotyping data, extra columns for cases and controls are necessary in order to distinguish the groups.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/snpalyze-8-0-snp-disease-association-analysis-software.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "snpalyze", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:59:59Z", "name": "SNPALYZE", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.dynacom.co.jp/english/snpalyze_e/e_sa_about.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
