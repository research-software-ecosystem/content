description: A sizable genomics study often involves the use of multiple batches.
  to minimize batch effects, a careful experiment design should ensure the even distribution
  of biological groups and confounding factors across batches. this tool is developed
  to facilitate the allocation of samples to different batches. it produces setup
  that optimizes the even distribution of samples in groups of biological interest
  into batches, reducing the confounding or correlation between batches and variables.
