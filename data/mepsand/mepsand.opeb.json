We present MEPSAnd, an open source GUI-based program that natively calculates minimum energy paths across energy surfaces of any number of dimensions. Among other features, MEPSAnd can compute the path through lowest barriers and automatically provide a set of alternative paths. MEPSAnd offers distinct plotting solutions as well as direct python scripting","homepage":"http://bioweb.cbm.uam.es/software/MEPSAnd/","name":"MEPSAnd"}}
