Background: A pan-genome is defined as the set of all unique gene families found in one or more strains of a prokaryotic species. Due to the extensive within-species diversity in the microbial world, the pan-genome is often many times larger than a single genome. Studies of pan-genomes have become popular due to the easy access to whole-genome sequence data for prokaryotes. A pan-genome study reveals species diversity and gene families that may be of special interest, e.g because of their role in bacterial survival or their ability to discriminate strains. Results: We present an R package for the study of prokaryotic pan-genomes. The R computing environment harbors endless possibilities with respect to statistical analyses and graphics. External free software is used for the heavy computations involved, and the R package provides functions for building a computational pipeline. Conclusions: We demonstrate parts of the package on a data set for the gram positive bacterium Enterococcus faecalis. The package is free to download and install from The Comprehensive R Archive Network.","authors":["Snipen L.","Liland K.H."],"cit_count":18,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-015-0517-0","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"micropan: An R-package for microbial pan-genomics","type":"Primary","year":"2015-03-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:micropan","biotoolsID":"micropan","description":"R package for the study of prokaryotic pan-genomes.
