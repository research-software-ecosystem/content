The ideas used in this package are based on the excellent work of Dan Carr, Nicholas Lewin-Koh, Martin Maechler and Thomas Lumley.\n\nThe goal of schex is to provide easy plotting of hexagon cell representations of single cell data stored in SingleCellExperiment or Seurat objects.\n\nYou can install schex using the Bioconductor project:.\n\n# install.packages(\"BiocManager\").\n\nDimensionReduction, Sequencing, SingleCell, Software, Visualization.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'schex'","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/schex.html","name":"AVAILABILITY:schex"}}
