Several tools for the task (bowtie, bwa, SOAP2, TopHat) have been developed that exploit Burrows-Wheeler transform and the backward backtracking technique on it, to map the reads to their best approximate occurrences in the genome. These tools use different tailored mechanisms for small error-levels to prune the search phase significantly. We propose a new pruning mechanism that can be seen a generalization of the tailored mechanisms used so far. It uses a novel idea of storing all cyclic rotations of fixed length substrings of the reference sequence with a compressed index that is able to exploit the repetitions created to level out the growth of the input set. For RNA-seq we propose a new method that combines dynamic programming with backtracking to map efficiently and correctly all reads that span two exons. Same mechanism can also be used for mapping mate-pair reads. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.", "citationCount": 11, "authors": [{"name": "Makinen V."}, {"name": "Valimaki N."}, {"name": "Laaksonen A."}, {"name": "Katainen R."}], "date": "2010-12-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Veli Makinen", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "vmakinen@cs.helsinki.fi"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:readaligner", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds/readaligner/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genome indexing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3211"}, {"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A tool for mapping (short) DNA reads into reference sequences.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["ELIXIR-EE"]}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "readaligner", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:16:04Z", "name": "Readaligner", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/group/suds/readaligner/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
