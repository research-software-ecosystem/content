                "abstract": "Alignment-based programs are valuable tools for finding potential homologs in genome sequences. Previously, it has been shown that partition function posterior probabilities attuned to local alignment achieve a high accuracy in identifying distantly similar non-coding RNA sequences that are hidden in a large genome. Here, we present an online implementation of that alignment algorithm based on such probabilities. Our server takes as input a query RNA sequence and a large genome sequence, and outputs a list of hits that are above a mean posterior probability threshold. The output is presented in a format suited to local alignment. It can also be viewed within the PLAST alignment viewer applet that provides a list of all hits found and highlights regions of high posterior probability within each local alignment.
