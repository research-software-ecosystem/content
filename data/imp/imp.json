                "abstract": "Integrative multi-species prediction (IMP) is an interactive web server that enables molecular biologists to interpret experimental results and to generate hypotheses in the context of a large cross-organism compendium of functional predictions and networks. The system provides a framework for biologists to analyze their candidate gene sets in the context of functional networks, as they expand or focus these sets by mining functional relationships predicted from integrated high-throughput data. IMP integrates prior knowledge and data collections from multiple organisms in its analyses. Through flexible and interactive visualizations, researchers can compare functional contexts and interpret the behavior of their gene sets across organisms. Additionally, IMP identifies homologs with conserved functional roles for knowledge transfer, allowing for accurate function predictions even for biological processes that have very few experimental annotations in a given organism. IMP currently supports seven organisms (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Rattus novegicus, Drosophila melanogaster, Danio rerio, Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), does not require any registration or installation and is freely available for use at http://imp.princeton.edu. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).",
