    "description": "Engrailed 1 overexpression as a potential prognostic marker in Lower Grade Glioma.\n\nBackground:Engrailed 1 (EN1), as a member of homeobox-containing transcription factors, participates in the development of the brain. High expressions of EN1 exist in various tumors. However, the role of EN1 in lower grade glioma (LGG) is still unknown. Methods:Coefficients of Cox regression were examined by data mining among 13 cancer types using OncoLnc to validate EN1 expressions in LGG patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA). Bioinformatic analysis was performed by using R2 and the UCSC Xena browser based on the data from 273 glioma cases in GSE16011 from GEO datasets and 530 cases of LGG patients in TCGA. Cases in GSE16011 were divided into two groups according to IDH1 mutation status.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'OncoLnc', 'EN1', 'glioma LGG LGG IDH1', 'LGG LGG IDH1'",
