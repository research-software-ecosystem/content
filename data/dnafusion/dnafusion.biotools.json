                "abstract": "Background: EML4-ALK gene fusions are oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and liquid biopsies containing EML4-ALK fragments can be used to study tumor dynamics using next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the sensitivity of EML4-ALK detection varies between pipelines and analysis tools. Results: We developed an R/Bioconductor package, DNAfusion, which can be applied to BAM files generated by commercially available NGS pipelines, such as AVENIO. Forty-eight blood samples from a training cohort consisting of 41 stage IV EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC patients and seven healthy controls were used to develop DNAfusion. DNAfusion detected EML4-ALK in significantly more samples (sensitivity = 61.0%) compared to AVENIO (sensitivity = 36.6%). The newly identified EML4-ALK-positive patients were verified using droplet digital PCR. DNAfusion was subsequently validated in a blinded validation cohort comprising 24 EML4-ALK-positive and 24 EML4-ALK-negative stage IV NSCLC patients. DNAfusion detected significantly more EML4-ALK individuals in the validation cohort (sensitivity = 62.5%) compared to AVENIO (sensitivity = 29.2%). DNAfusion demonstrated a specificity of 100% in both the training and validation cohorts. Conclusion: Here we present DNAfusion, which increases the sensitivity of EML4-ALK detection in liquid biopsies and can be implemented downstream of commercially available NGS pipelines. The simplistic method of operating the R package makes it easy to implement in the clinical setting, enabling wider expansion of NGS-based diagnostics.",
