Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. With currently more than 126 000 publicly available structures and an increasing growth rate, the Protein Data Bank constitutes a rich data source for structure-driven research in fields like drug discovery, crop science and biotechnology in general. Typical workflows in these areas involve manifold computational tools for the analysis and prediction of molecular functions. Here, we present the ProteinsPlus web server that offers a unified easy-to-use interface to a broad range of tools for the early phase of structure-based molecular modeling. This includes solutions for commonly required pre-processing tasks like structure quality assessment (EDIA), hydrogen placement (Protoss) and the search for alternative conformations (SIENA). Beyond that, it also addresses frequent problems as the generation of 2D-interaction diagrams (PoseView), protein-protein interface classification (HyPPI) as well as automatic pocket detection and druggablity assessment (DoGSiteScorer). The unified ProteinsPlus interface covering all featured approaches provides various facilities for intuitive input and result visualization, case-specific parameterization and download options for further processing. Moreover, its generalized workflow allows the user a quick familiarization with the different tools. ProteinsPlus also stores the calculated results temporarily for future request and thus facilitates convenient result communication and re-access.","authors":["Fahrrolfes R.","Bietz S.","Flachsenberg F.","Meyder A.","Nittinger E.","Otto T.","Volkamer A.","Rarey M."],"cit_count":11,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx333","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"Proteins Plus: A web portal for structure analysis of macromolecules","type":"Primary","year":"2017-07-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:proteinsplus","biotoolsID":"proteinsplus","description":"It supports various commonly required tasks of structure-based molecular modeling.
