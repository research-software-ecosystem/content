Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: The initial step in many orthology inference methods is the computationally demanding establishment of all pairwise protein similarities across all analysed proteomes. The quadratic scaling with proteomes has become a major bottleneck. A remedy is offered by the Hieranoid algorithm which reduces the complexity to linear by hierarchically aggregating ortholog groups from InParanoid along a species tree. Results: We have further developed the Hieranoid algorithm in many ways. Major improvements have been made to the construction of multiple sequence alignments and consensus sequences. Hieranoid version 2 was evaluated with standard benchmarks that reveal a dramatic increase in the coverage/accuracy tradeoff over version 1, such that it now compares favourably with the best methods. The new parallelized cluster mode allows Hieranoid to be run on large data sets in a much shorter timespan than InParanoid, yet at similar accuracy.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Kaduk M."}, {"name": "Sonnhammer E."}], "date": "2017-04-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/nar/gkw923", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "27742821", "type": null, "pmcid": "PMC5210627", "metadata": null}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": [], "name": "Stockholm Bioinformatics Centre", "url": "http://www.sbc.su.se/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mateusz Kaduk", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mateusz.kaduk@scilifelab.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hieranoid", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://hieranoidb.sbc.su.se/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Orthology inference method using a hierarchical approach.
