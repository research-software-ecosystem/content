MONKEY employs probabilistic models of factor specificity and binding-site evolution, on which basis we compute the likelihood that putative sites are conserved and assign statistical significance to each hit. Using genomes from the genus Saccharomyces, we illustrate how the significance of real sites increases with evolutionary distance and explore the relationship between conservation and function.","authors":["Moses A.M.","Chiang D.Y.","Pollard D.A.","Iyer V.N.","Eisen M.B."],"cit_count":117,"journal":"Genome biology","pmid":"15575972","title":"MONKEY: identifying conserved transcription-factor binding sites in multiple alignments using a binding site-specific evolutionary model.","year":"2004-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:monkey","biotoolsID":"monkey","description":"MONKEY is a set of programs designed to search alignments of non-coding DNA sequence for matches to matrices representing the sequence specificity of transcription factors.","homepage":"http://labs.csb.utoronto.ca/moses/monkey.html","name":"MONKEY"}}
