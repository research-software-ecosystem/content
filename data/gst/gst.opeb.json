            "abstract": "Whole-exome sequencing (WES) can identify causative mutations in hereditary diseases. However, WES data might have a large candidate variant list, including false positives. Moreover, in families, it is more difficult to select disease-associated variants because many variants are shared among members. To reduce false positives and extract accurate candidates, we used a multilocus variant instead of a single-locus variant (SNV). We set up a specific window to analyze the multilocus variant and devised a sliding-window approach to observe all variants. We developed the gene selection tool (GST) based on proportion tests for linkage analysis using WES data. This tool is R program coded and has high sensitivity. We tested our code to find the gene for hereditary spastic paraplegia using SNVs from a specific family and identified the gene known to cause the disease in a significant gene list. The list identified other genes that might be associated with the disease.",
