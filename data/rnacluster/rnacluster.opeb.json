It can be used for analysis of RNA energy landscapes, conformational switches, and facilitating RNA structure prediction. The purpose of our integrated tool RNACluster is twofold: to provide a platform for computing and comparison of different distances between RNA secondary structures, and to perform cluster identification to derive useful information of RNA structure ensembles, using a minimum spanning tree (MST) based clustering algorithm. RNACluster employs a cluster identification approach based on a MST representation of the RNA ensemble data and currently supports six distance measures between RNA secondary structures. RNACluster provides a user-friendly graphical interface to allow a user to compare different structural distances, analyze the structure ensembles, and visualize predicted structural clusters. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","authors":["Liu Q.","Olman V.","Liu H.","Ye X.","Qiu S.","Xu Y."],"cit_count":9,"journal":"Journal of Computational Chemistry","pmid":"18271070","title":"RNACluster: An integrated tool for RNA secondary structure comparison and clustering","year":"2008-07-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rnacluster","biotoolsID":"rnacluster","description":"The tool can be used to study the characteristics of RNA secondary structures, RNA structure conformational switches, RNA conformational energy landscapes and RNA secondary structure prediction based on the clustering of structure ensemble.","homepage":"http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/publications/materials/qiliu/RNACluster.html","name":"RNACluster"}}
