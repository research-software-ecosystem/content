      "sc:description": "CpelTdm is a julia package designed to perform DNA methylation differential analysis. The package has several advantages when compared to traditional DNA methylation differential analysis packages. CpelTdm not only detects mean methylation level differences between groups, but it can also detect significant differences in methylation entropy as well as in the probability distribution of methylation.",
