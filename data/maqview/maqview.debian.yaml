description: Maqview is graphical read alignment viewer. It is specifically designed
  for the Maq alignment file and allows you to see the mismatches, base qualities
  and mapping qualities. Maqview is nothing fancy as Consed or GAP, but just a simple
  viewer for you to see what happens in a particular region. . In comparison to tgap-maq,
  the text-based read alignment viewer written by James Bonfield, Maqview is faster
  and takes up much less memory and disk space in indexing. This is possibly because
  tgap aims to be a general-purpose viewer but Maqview fully makes use of the fact
  that a Maq alignment file has already been sorted. Maqview is also efficient in
  viewing and provides a command-line tool to quickly retrieve any region in an Maq
  alignment file.
