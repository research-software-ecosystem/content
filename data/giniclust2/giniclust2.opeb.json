Single-cell analysis is a powerful tool for dissecting the cellular composition within a tissue or organ. However, it remains difficult to detect rare and common cell types at the same time. Here, we present a new computational method, GiniClust2, to overcome this challenge. GiniClust2 combines the strengths of two complementary approaches, using the Gini index and Fano factor, respectively, through a cluster-aware, weighted ensemble clustering technique. GiniClust2 successfully identifies both common and rare cell types in diverse datasets, outperforming existing methods. GiniClust2 is scalable to large datasets.","authors":["Tsoucas D.","Yuan G.-C."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-018-1431-3","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"GiniClust2: A cluster-aware, weighted ensemble clustering method for cell-type detection","year":"2018-05-10"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:giniclust2","biotoolsID":"giniclust2","description":"Clustering algorithm for the simultaneous detection of common and rare cell types from single-cell gene expression data.","homepage":"https://github.com/dtsoucas/GiniClust2","name":"GiniClust2"}}
