    "description": "Computational pan-genome mapping and pairwise SNP-distance improve detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission clusters.\n\nNext-generation sequencing based base-by-base distance measures have become an integral complement to epidemiological investigation of infectious disease outbreaks. This study introduces PANPASCO, a computational pan-genome mapping based, pairwise distance method that is highly sensitive to differences between cases, even when located in regions of lineage specific reference genomes. We show that our approach is superior to previously published methods in several datasets and across different Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages, as its characteristics allow the comparison of a high number of diverse samples in one analysis-a scenario that becomes more and more likely with the increased usage of whole-genome sequencing in transmission surveillance",
