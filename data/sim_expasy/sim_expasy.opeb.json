This paper presents a time-efficient algorithm that produces k best \"non-intersecting\" local alignments for any chosen k. The algorithm's main strength is that it needs only O(M + N + K) space, where M and N are the lengths of the given sequences and K is the total length of the computed alignments. © 1991.","authors":["Huang X.","Miller W."],"cit_count":751,"doi":"10.1016/0196-8858(91)90017-D","journal":"Advances in Applied Mathematics","title":"A time-efficient, linear-space local similarity algorithm","type":"Primary","year":"1991-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sim_expasy","biotoolsID":"sim_expasy","description":"SIM finds a user-defined number of best non-intersecting alignments between two protein sequences or within a sequence.
