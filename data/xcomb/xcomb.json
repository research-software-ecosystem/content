For a given set of proteins the key software tool, xComb, combs through all theoretically feasible cross-linked peptides to create a database consisting of a subset of all combinations represented as peptide FASTA files. The xComb library of select theoretical cross-linked peptides may then be used as a database that is examined by a standard proteomic search engine to match tandem mass spectral data sets to identify cross-linked peptides. The database search may be conducted against as many as 50 proteins with a number of common proteomic search engines, e.g. Phenyx, Sequest, OMSSA, Mascot and X!Tandem. By searching against a peptide library of linearized, cross-linked peptides, rather than a linearized protein library, search times are decreased and the process is decoupled from any specific search engine. A further benefit of decoupling from the search engine is that protein cross-linking studies may be conducted with readily available informatics tools for which scoring routines already exist within the proteomic community. \u00a9 2010 American Chemical Society.", "citationCount": 55, "authors": [{"name": "Panchaud A."}, {"name": "Singh P."}, {"name": "Shaffer S.A."}, {"name": "Goodlett D.R."}], "date": "2010-05-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Documentor"], "name": null, "url": "http://ms-utils.org", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "webmaster@ms-utils.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:xcomb", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://goodlett.umaryland.edu/xcomb.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}, {"term": "Protein structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:42:42Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Interogate protein-protein interactions and protein structure using cross-links FASTA databases.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://ms-utils.org", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "xcomb", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T14:51:44Z", "name": "xComb", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
