For a given set of proteins the key software tool, xComb, combs through all theoretically feasible cross-linked peptides to create a database consisting of a subset of all combinations represented as peptide FASTA files. The xComb library of select theoretical cross-linked peptides may then be used as a database that is examined by a standard proteomic search engine to match tandem mass spectral data sets to identify cross-linked peptides. The database search may be conducted against as many as 50 proteins with a number of common proteomic search engines, e.g. Phenyx, Sequest, OMSSA, Mascot and X!Tandem. By searching against a peptide library of linearized, cross-linked peptides, rather than a linearized protein library, search times are decreased and the process is decoupled from any specific search engine. A further benefit of decoupling from the search engine is that protein cross-linking studies may be conducted with readily available informatics tools for which scoring routines already exist within the proteomic community. © 2010 American Chemical Society.","authors":["Panchaud A.","Singh P.","Shaffer S.A.","Goodlett D.R."],"cit_count":55,"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","pmid":"20302351","title":"XComb: A cross-linked peptide database approach to protein-protein interaction analysis","year":"2010-05-07"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:xcomb","biotoolsID":"xcomb","description":"Interogate protein-protein interactions and protein structure using cross-links FASTA databases.","homepage":"https://goodlett.umaryland.edu/xcomb.php","name":"xComb"}}
