We present a novel unsupervised batch effect removal framework, called iMAP, based on both deep autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. Compared with current methods, iMAP shows superior, robust, and scalable performance in terms of both reliably detecting the batch-specific cells and effectively mixing distributions of the batch-shared cell types. Applying iMAP to tumor microenvironment datasets from two platforms, Smart-seq2 and 10x Genomics, we find that iMAP can leverage the powers of both platforms to discover novel cell-cell interactions.",
