    "description": "A Toolbox for ICA Map Classification and Individualized ROI Definition.\n\nPersonode is a MATLAB toolbox designed for regions-of-interest (ROI) individualization based on fMRI spatial independent component analysis (ICA) maps after a semi-automatic classification into resting-state networks (RSNs).\n\nPersonode is a user-friendly, open-source MatLab toolbox that semi-automatically guides through ICA components classification into resting-state networks (RSN), alleviating the selection process, and allows the robust definition of either group- or subject-specific ROIs derived from RSN, which could make network analysis more accurate and individually specific.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Canonical resting state networks (RSNs) can be obtained through independent component analysis (ICA). RSNs are reproducible across subjects but also present inter-individual differences, which can be used to individualize regions-of-interest (ROI) definition, thus making fMRI analyses more accurate. Unfortunately, no automatic tool for defining subject-specific ROIs exists, making the classification of ICAs as representatives of RSN time-consuming and largely dependent on visual inspection. Here, we present Personode, a user-friendly and open source MATLAB-based toolbox that semi-automatically performs the classification of RSN and allows for defining subject- and group-specific ROIs. To validate the applicability of our new approach and to assess potential improvements compared to previous approaches, we applied Personode to both task-related activation and resting-state data. Our analyses show that for task-related activation analyses, subject-specific spherical ROIs defined with Personode produced higher activity contrasts compared to ROIs derived from single-study and meta-analytic coordinates. We also show that subject-specific irregular ROIs defined with Personode improved ROI-to-ROI functional connectivity analyses. Hence, Personode might be a useful toolbox for ICA map classification into RSNs and group- as well as subject-specific ROI definitions, leading to improved analyses of task-related activation and functional connectivity.",
