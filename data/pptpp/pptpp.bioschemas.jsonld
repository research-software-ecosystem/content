The enviroment where PPTPP was built was exported as the file named PPTPPenvironment.yaml in the Zip file, please make sure you have the same environment to make everything works.\n\nMake sure JAVA, C++ complier have been properly installed on your machine to avoid the disappointment of getting errors.\n\nYour javac need to support the version 6, therefore, we recommend to use JDK 11 rather than 13.",
