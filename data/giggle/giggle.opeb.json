GIGGLE is a genomics search engine that identifies and ranks the significance of genomic loci shared between query features and thousands of genome interval files. GIGGLE (https://github.com/ryanlayer/giggle) scales to billions of intervals and is over three orders of magnitude faster than existing methods. Its speed extends the accessibility and utility of resources such as ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and GTEx by facilitating data integration and hypothesis generation.","authors":["Layer R.M.","Pedersen B.S.","Disera T.","Marth G.T.","Gertz J.","Quinlan A.R."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4556","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"GIGGLE: a search engine for large-scale integrated genome analysis","year":"2018-02-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:giggle","biotoolsID":"giggle","description":"A genomic interval searching strategy that provides users with the ability to conduct large-scale comparisons of their results with thousands of reference data sets and genome annotations in seconds.
