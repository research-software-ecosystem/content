    "description": "PCaLiStDB is the first database focus on a specific disease related lifestyles. It integrates possible lifestyles and lifestyle-related factors included foods, nutrients, habits, social factors, environment, associated genes, physiological and biochemical indexes together with the corresponding diseases or drugs. It provides a Lifestyle-Wide Association Studies of PCa (PCa_LWAS), seeking to identify the systematic and deep-seated studies between lifestyles and PCa, and to study the profound benefits achievable with lifestyle changes and to tell people “what to do”, “how to do” and to continue developing ways to encourage choices that promote human health.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to accelerate the translation of LWAS discoveries into results that are closer to clinical applications, to obtain the accurate predictive models for prostate cancer prevention based on evidence-based personalized lifestyle-related data.",

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press.The interaction between genes, lifestyles and environmental factors makes the genesis and progress of prostate cancer (PCa) very heterogeneous. Positive lifestyle is important to the prevention and controlling of PCa. To investigate the relationship between PCa and lifestyle at systems level, we established a PCa related lifestyle database (PCaLiStDB) and collected the PCa-related lifestyles including foods, nutrients, life habits and social and environmental factors as well as associated genes and physiological and biochemical indexes together with the disease phenotypes and drugs. Data format standardization was implemented for the future Lifestyle-Wide Association Studies of PCa (PCa_LWAS). Currently, 2290 single-factor lifestyles and 856 joint effects of two or more lifestyles were collected. Among these, 394 are protective factors, 556 are risk factors, 45 are no-influencing factors, 52 are factors with contradictory views and 1977 factors are lacking effective literatures support. PCaLiStDB is expected to facilitate the prevention and control of PCa, as well as the promotion of mechanistic study of lifestyles on PCa. Database URL: http://www.sysbio.org.cn/pcalistdb/.",
