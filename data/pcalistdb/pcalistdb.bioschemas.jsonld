It integrates possible lifestyles and lifestyle-related factors included foods, nutrients, habits, social factors, environment, associated genes, physiological and biochemical indexes together with the corresponding diseases or drugs. It provides a Lifestyle-Wide Association Studies of PCa (PCa_LWAS), seeking to identify the systematic and deep-seated studies between lifestyles and PCa, and to study the profound benefits achievable with lifestyle changes and to tell people “what to do”, “how to do” and to continue developing ways to encourage choices that promote human health.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to accelerate the translation of LWAS discoveries into results that are closer to clinical applications, to obtain the accurate predictive models for prostate cancer prevention based on evidence-based personalized lifestyle-related data.",
