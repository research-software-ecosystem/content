As the original version, the refined method provides good representation of the structure and dynamics of folded proteins but provides much better representations of a variety of unfolded proteins, including some very large, impossible to analyze by atomistic simulation methods. The PACSAB/DMD method also reproduces accurately aggregation properties, providing good pictures of the structural ensembles of proteins showing a folded core and an intrinsically disordered region. The combination of accuracy and speed makes the method presented here a good alternative for the exploration of unstructured protein systems.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Emperador A."}, {"name": "Orozco M."}], "date": "2017-03-14T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine Barcelona", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "info@irbbarcelona.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:discrete_dmd", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:39Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics simulation package.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["adam.hospital@irbbarcelona.org", "gelpi@ub.edu"]}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "discrete_dmd", "additionDate": "2016-10-03T14:08:37Z", "name": "DISCRETE (DMD)", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
