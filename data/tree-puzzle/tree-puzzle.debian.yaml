description: TREE-PUZZLE (the new name for PUZZLE) is an interactive console program
  that implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows analysis
  of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of support to each internal
  branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum likelihood distances as well
  as branch lengths for user specified trees. Branch lengths can also be calculated
  under the clock-assumption. In addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood
  mapping, to investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without computing
  an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content of a sequence alignment.
