summary: Reconstruction of phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood
description: >
   TREE-PUZZLE (the new name for PUZZLE) is an interactive console program that
   implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that allows
   analysis of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations of support
   to each internal branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise maximum
   likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user specified trees.
   Branch lengths can also be calculated under the clock-assumption. In
   addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood mapping, to
   investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without
   computing an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content of
   a sequence alignment.
