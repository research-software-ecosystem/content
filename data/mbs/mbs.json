The inference of the roles of these mechanisms, including natural selection, relies heavily on computer simulations. A coalescent simulation is extremely powerful in generating a large number of samples of DNA sequences from a population (species) when all mutations are neutral, and Hudson's ms software is frequently used for this purpose. However, it has been difficult to incorporate natural selection into the coalescent framework. Results: We herein present a software applicationto generate samples of DNA sequences when there is a biallelic site targeted by selection. This software application, referred to as mbs, is developed by modifying Hudson's ms. The mbs software is so flexible that it can incorporate any arbitrary histories of population size changes and any mode of selection as long as selection is operating on a biallelic site. Conclusion: mbs provides opportunities to investigate the effect of any mode of selection on the pattern of SNPs under various demography. \u00a9 2009 Teshima and Innan; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 26, "authors": [{"name": "Teshima K.M."}, {"name": "Innan H."}], "date": "2009-05-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Kosuke M Teshima", "url": "http://www.sendou.soken.ac.jp/esb/innan/InnanLab/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kteshima@soken.ac.jp"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mbs", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.sendou.soken.ac.jp/esb/innan/InnanLab/software.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Simulation program to generate patterns of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in a region that is linked to a biallelic site targeted by selection.
