The purpose of this tool is to test if a list of proteins/genes is associated with a certain cell type in a HPA tested tissue. E.g. you have a list of protein coding genes from a differential expression single cell analysis and want to see if these proteins are associated with a known cell type. Instead of querying HPA multiple times you can load your list in HPAStainR which will return a ranked table of the cell types with the most protein staining.",
