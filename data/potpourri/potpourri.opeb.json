These instructions will guide you to build and run Potpourri on MATLAB.\n\nAfter running Potpourri, files above will be either created, or appended to, in the output directory. ###.Summary The summary file contains several statistics such as statistical tests performed, number of reciprocal pairs found, Each row corresponds to a separate run. ###.Cutoff Pairs Contains all detected pairs above the dynamic significance threshold at the conclusion of a run. ###.Reciprocal Pairs Contains a subset of the pairs in the cutoff pairs set such that both loci in a pairing had the other locus selected as its most significant interaction. ###.Reciprocal Pairs Formatted Each row represents a single reciprocal locus pairing with chi-squared significance, locus 1 and 2, chromosome 1 and 2, base pair 1 and 2","homepage":"http://ciceklab.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/potpourri","name":"Potpourri"}}
