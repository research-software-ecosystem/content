        "description": "A database for construction and analysis of functional interaction networks for any species with a sequenced genome.\n\nEarth BioGenome Project has been officially launched in November 2018 with the goal of decoding genomes of Earth’s biome over a period of 10 years. For every sequenced species, genome annotation will be followed by functional annotation for individual genes and pathways. Network biology can facilitate functional annotations of genomes in the context of collaborative interactions between genes.\n\nBiomeNet is a database of scored functional networks enabling network biology for every sequenced genome of Earth’s biome. With protein sequences of target species submitted by users, BiomeNet will transfer co-functional links between orthologous proteins from 95 source networks (comprising ~8 million links), which were previously constructed and validated for 18 species (5 animals, 6 plants, 5 bacteria, and 2 fungi)",
