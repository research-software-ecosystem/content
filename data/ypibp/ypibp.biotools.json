    "description": "YPIBP is an inclusive database consisting of all the members of phosphatidylinositols-binding proteins which are collected from high-throughput proteome and lipid array studies, QuickGO and a rigorous literature mining. Cumulatively, across all PI, total of 679 PI-binding proteins were collected. YPIBP also contains protein domain information which is categorized as lipid-binding, lipid-related and others, helping users to underpin the domain-based knowledge on lipid-protein interactions.",

                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s)Phosphoinositides (PIs) are a family of eight lipids consisting of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and its seven phosphorylated forms. PIs have important regulatory functions in the cell including lipid signaling, protein transport, and membrane trafficking. Yeast has been recognized as a eukaryotic model system to study lipid-protein interactions. Hundreds of yeast PI-binding proteins have been identified, but this research knowledge remains scattered. Besides, the complete PI-binding spectrum and potential PI-binding domains have not been interlinked. No comprehensive databases are available to support the lipid-protein interaction research on phosphoinositides. Here we constructed the first knowledgebase of Yeast Phosphoinositide-Binding Proteins (YPIBP), a repository consisting of 679 PI-binding proteins collected from high-throughput proteome-array and lipid-array studies, QuickGO, and a rigorous literature mining. The YPIBP also contains protein domain information in categories of lipid-binding domains, lipid-related domains and other domains. The YPIBP provides search and browse modes along with two enrichment analyses (PI-binding enrichment analysis and domain enrichment analysis). An interactive visualization is given to summarize the PI-domain-protein interactome. Finally, three case studies were given to demonstrate the utility of YPIBP. The YPIBP knowledgebase consolidates the present knowledge and provides new insights of the PI-binding proteins by bringing comprehensive and in-depth interaction network of the PI-binding proteins. YPIBP is available at http://cosbi7.ee.ncku.edu.tw/YPIBP/.",
