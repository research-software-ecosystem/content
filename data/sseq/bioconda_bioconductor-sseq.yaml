about:
  description: The purpose of this package is to discover the genes that are differentially
    expressed between two conditions in RNA-seq experiments. Gene expression is measured
    in counts of transcripts and modeled with the Negative Binomial (NB) distribution
    using a shrinkage approach for dispersion estimation. The method of moment (MM)
    estimates for dispersion are shrunk towards an estimated target, which minimizes
    the average squared difference between the shrinkage estimates and the initial
    estimates. The exact per-gene probability under the NB model is calculated, and
    used to test the hypothesis that the expected expression of a gene in two conditions
    identically follow a NB distribution.
