It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. Each DWB module is devoted to a specific data domain. DE is currently used in a core installation at the SNSB, Botanische Staatssammlung MÃ¼nchen to manage bibliographic information and standardized abbreviations of botanical and mycological exsiccatae in a global index. Exsiccatae are series of specimen collections which are distributed as a publication together with assigned printed matters. They are usually available in multiple copies worldwide. This standard list for Exsiccatal series with unique and stable series identifers is increasing the efficiency of the digitization of botanical and mycological collections.",
