                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 (2002), novel coronaviruses have emerged periodically like the MERS- CoV (2012) and now, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak which has posed a global threat to public health. Although, this is the third zoonotic coronavirus breakout within the last two decades, there are only a few platforms that provide information about coronavirus genomes. None of them is specific for the virulence glycoproteins and complete sequence-structural features of these virulence factors across the betacoronavirus family including SARS-CoV-2 strains are lacking. Against this backdrop, we present DBCOVP (http://covp.immt.res.in/), the first manually-curated, web-based resource to provide extensive information on the complete repertoire of structural virulent glycoproteins from coronavirus genomes belonging to betacoronavirus genera. The database provides various sequence-structural properties in which users can browse and analyze information in different ways. Furthermore, many conserved T-cell and B-cell epitopes predicted for each protein are present that may perform a significant role in eliciting the humoral and cellular immune response. The tertiary structure of the epitopes together with the docked epitope-HLA binding-complex is made available to facilitate further analysis. DBCOVP presents an easy-to-use interface with in-built tools for similarity search, cross-genome comparison, phylogenetic, and multiple sequence alignment. DBCOVP will certainly be an important resource for experimental biologists engaged in coronavirus research studies and will aid in vaccine development.",
