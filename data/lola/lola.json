Published by Oxford University Press. Summary: Genomic datasets are often interpreted in the context of large-scale reference databases. One approach is to identify significantly overlapping gene sets, which works well for gene-centric data. However, many types of high-throughput data are based on genomic regions. Locus Overlap Analysis (LOLA) provides easy and automatable enrichment analysis for genomic region sets, thus facilitating the interpretation of functional genomics and epigenomics data.
