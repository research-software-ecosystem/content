                "abstract": "© 2022 Elsevier Inc.A deep insight into the 3D structures of the proteins is essential to understand their functions and will be helpful in drug design and making decisions for the treatment of diseases. The 3D structure for less than one-thousandth of the protein sequences has been determined so far due to the slow structure elucidation procedures with experimental methods, such as X-ray. For this reason, different computational methods were used to determine the structure of the proteins, including template-based and de novo approaches. Much software has been developed to facilitate the computational approaches in protein modeling, some of which need user expertise and extensive knowledge in bioinformatics. The present study attempted to provide a user-friendly environment to motivate the researchers in computational biology, a Python-based interface based on MODELLER software. PyProtModel can be used as a toolbox in structural bioinformatics for protein modeling from sequence to the prediction of 3D structure. In addition, the users can take benefits of PyProtModel in order to prepare and evaluate protein PDB files prior to other in silico experiments. PyProtModel allows the user to apply different MODELLER options, automates, and speeds up time-consuming homology modeling steps. Different aspects of PyProtModel and a comprehensive view of the application will be discussed in this paper. The application is available for download and use at: https://github.com/msisakht/pyprotmodel.git.",
