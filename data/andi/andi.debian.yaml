summary: Efficient Estimation of Evolutionary Distances
description: >
   This is the andi program for estimating the evolutionary distance
   between closely related genomes. These distances can be used to rapidly
   infer phylogenies for big sets of genomes. Because andi does not compute
   full alignments, it is so efficient that it scales even up to thousands
   of bacterial genomes.
