description: SeqPrep is a program to merge paired end Illumina reads that are overlapping
  into a single longer read. It may also just be used for its adapter trimming feature
  without doing any paired end overlap. When an adapter sequence is present, that
  means that the two reads must overlap (in most cases) so they are forcefully merged.
  When reads do not have adapter sequence they must be treated with care when doing
  the merging, so a much more specific approach is taken. The default parameters were
  chosen with specificity in mind, so that they could be ran on libraries where very
  few reads are expected to overlap. It is always safest though to save the overlapping
  procedure for libraries where you have some prior knowledge that a significant portion
  of the reads will have some overlap.
