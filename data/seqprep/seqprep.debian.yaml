summary: stripping adaptors and/or merging paired reads of DNA sequences with overlap
description: >
   SeqPrep is a program to merge paired end Illumina reads that are overlapping
   into a single longer read. It may also just be used for its adapter trimming
   feature without doing any paired end overlap. When an adapter sequence is
   present, that means that the two reads must overlap (in most cases) so they
   are forcefully merged. When reads do not have adapter sequence they must be
   treated with care when doing the merging, so a much more specific approach is
   taken. The default parameters were chosen with specificity in mind, so that
   they could be ran on libraries where very few reads are expected to overlap.
   It is always safest though to save the overlapping procedure for libraries
   where you have some prior knowledge that a significant portion of the reads
   will have some overlap.
