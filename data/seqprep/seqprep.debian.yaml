description: "SeqPrep is a program to merge paired end Illumina reads that are overlapping\
  \ into a single longer read. It may also just be used for its adapter trimming feature\
  \ without doing any paired end overlap. When an adapter sequence is present, that\
  \ means that the two reads must overlap (in most cases) so they are forcefully merged.\
  \ When reads do not have adapter sequence they must be treated with care when doing\
  \ the merging, so a much more specific approach is taken. The default parameters\
  \ were chosen with specificity in mind, so that they could be ran on libraries where\
  \ very few reads are expected to overlap. It is always safest though to save the\
  \ overlapping procedure for libraries where you have some prior knowledge that a\
  \ significant portion of the reads will have some overlap.\n"
