description: Analysis of Ct values from high throughput quantitative real-time PCR
  (qPCR) assays across multiple conditions or replicates. The input data can be from
  spatially-defined formats such ABI TaqMan Low Density Arrays or OpenArray; LightCycler
  from Roche Applied Science; the CFX plates from Bio-Rad Laboratories; conventional
  96- or 384-well plates; or microfluidic devices such as the Dynamic Arrays from
  Fluidigm Corporation. HTqPCR handles data loading, quality assessment, normalization,
  visualization and parametric or non-parametric testing for statistical significance
  in Ct values between features (e.g. genes, microRNAs).
