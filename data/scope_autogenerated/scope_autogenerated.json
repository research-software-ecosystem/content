    "description": "A new method to quantify 3D biological structures and identify differences in zebrafish forebrain development.\n\nResearch in the life sciences has traditionally relied on the analysis of clear morphological phenotypes, which are often revealed using increasingly powerful microscopy techniques analyzed as maximum intensity projections (MIPs). However, as biology turns towards the analysis of more subtle phenotypes, MIPs and qualitative approaches are failing to adequately describe these phenotypes. To address these limitations and quantitatively analyze the three-dimensional (3D) spatial relationships of biological structures, we developed the computational method and program called \u0394SCOPE (Changes in Spatial Cylindrical Coordinate Orientation using PCA Examination).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
