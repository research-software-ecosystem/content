                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.The goals of the Veterinary Committee on Trauma (VetCOT) trauma registry are to (1) inform improvement of veterinary and human trauma patient care and (2) design clinical and preclinical trials that could inform go/no go decisions for interventional strategies and tools. The VetCOT registry was established in 2013, and includes all trauma cases that present to Veterinary Trauma Centers. Veterinary Trauma Centers are well-resourced veterinary hospitals that are initially identified, then subsequently verified, by the American College of Veterinary and Emergency Critical Care VetCOT (http://vetcot.org/index.php/home/identification-and-verification-process/). As of June 2019, there are > 40,000 dog and cat cases in the registry, 3 publications and 9 ongoing projects utilizing data from the registry. Application materials to utilize VetCOT registry data is available on the VetCOT website (http://vetcot.org/index.php/home/registry-use-materials/)",
