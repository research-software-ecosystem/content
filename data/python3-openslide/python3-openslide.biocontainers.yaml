description: OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface for reading
  whole-slide images, also known as virtual slides, which are high-resolution images
  used in digital pathology. These images can occupy tens of gigabytes when uncompressed,
  and so cannot be easily read using standard tools or libraries, which are designed
  for images that can be comfortably uncompressed into RAM. Whole-slide images are
  typically multi-resolution; OpenSlide allows reading a small amount of image data
  at the resolution closest to a desired zoom level.
