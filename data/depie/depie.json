However, none of these existing programs can be directly used for the design of primers in protein interaction experiments, since proteins may have transmembrane domains (TMDs) and/or a signal peptide that must be excluded from experiments. Furthermore, it is frequently the case that a short restriction sequences must be added to each primer in order to clone PCR products into a given destination vectors for expression. DePIE, a web-based primer design tool, was developed to address these deficiencies. The program takes as input NCBI protein accession numbers and returns primer information including nucleotide sequences, thermodynamic melting temperature of the nucleotide sequences and the target positions. DePIE is implemented in JAVA, PERL and PHP and has proven to be very efficient in designing primers for our interaction experiments.
