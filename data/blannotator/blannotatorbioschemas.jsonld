  "sc:description": "Blannotator is a rapid tool for functional prediction of gene or proteins sequences. The tool accepts DNA or protein sequences, given in FASTA-format, and performs a Blast homology search against UniProtKB databases. Matching sequences with similar annotations are merged into families of similar descriptions, which are, in turn, further unified, based on assigned GO-profiles retrieved from GOA, into sets of functionally equivalent sequences. As a result, a reliable description will be obtained.",
