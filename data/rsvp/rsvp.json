Although many solutions have been proposed for reconstructing putative isoforms from deep sequencing data, these generally take as their substrate the collective alignment structure of RNA-seq reads and ignore the biological signals present in the actual nucleotide sequence. The majority of these solutions are graph-theoretic, relying on a splice graph representing the splicing patterns and exon expression levels indicated by the spliced-alignment process. Results: We show how to augment splice graphs with additional information reflecting the biology of transcription, splicing and translation, to produce what we call an ORF (open reading frame) graph. We then show how ORF graphs can be used to produce isoform predictions with higher accuracy than current state-of-the-art approaches. \u00a9 2014 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Majoros W.H."}, {"name": "Lebeck N."}, {"name": "Ohler U."}, {"name": "Li S."}], "date": "2014-07-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Uwe.Ohler@mdc-berlin.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rsvp", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/RNA-seq_Variant_Prediction_61/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2454"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A software package for prediction of alternative isoforms of protein-coding genes, based on both genomic DNA evidence and aligned RNA-seq reads. \u00a0The method is based on the use of ORF graphs, which are more general than the splice graphs used in traditional transcript assembly.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/rsvp-rna-seq-variant-prediction.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "rsvp", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:58:15Z", "name": "RSVP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://ohlerlab.mdc-berlin.de/software/RNA-seq_Variant_Prediction_61/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
