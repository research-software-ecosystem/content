description: PeptideShaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation
  of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines, currently supporting
  X!Tandem, MS-GF+, Metamorpheus, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide, Mascot,
  Andromeda and mzIdentML. By combining the results from multiple search engines,
  while re-calculating PTM localization scores and redoing the protein inference,
  PeptideShaker attempts to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics
  data!
