description: 'PeptideShaker is a search engine independent platform for interpretation
  of proteomics identification results from multiple search engines,

  currently supporting X!Tandem, MS-GF+, MS Amanda, OMSSA, MyriMatch, Comet, Tide,
  Mascot, Andromeda and mzIdentML.

  By combining the results from multiple search engines, while re-calculating PTM
  localization scores and redoing the protein inference,

  PeptideShaker attempts to give you the best possible understanding of your proteomics
  data!
