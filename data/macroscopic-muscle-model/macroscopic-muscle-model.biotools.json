                "abstract": "Hill-type muscle models are commonly used in biomechanical simulations to predict passive and active muscle forces. Here, a model is presented which consists of four elements: a contractile element with force-length and force-velocity relations for concentric and eccentric contractions, a parallel elastic element, a series elastic element, and a serial damping element. With this, it combines previously published effects relevant for muscular contraction, i.e. serial damping and eccentric force-velocity relation. The model is exemplarily applied to arm movements. The more realistic representation of the eccentric force-velocity relation results in human-like elbow-joint flexion. The model is provided as ready to use Matlab \u00ae and Simulink \u00ae code. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",
