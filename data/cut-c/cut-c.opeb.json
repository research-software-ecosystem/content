Existing methods, such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and Hi-C have enabled the identification of novel aspects of chromatin structure. Further identification of protein-centric chromatin conformation is enabled by coupling the Hi-C procedure with a conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. However, these methods are time-consuming and require independent methods for validation. RESULTS:To simultaneously identify protein-centric chromatin conformation and target protein localization, we have developed Cut-C, a method that combines antibody-mediated cleavage by tethered nuclease with chromosome conformation capture to identify chromatin interactions mediated by a protein of interest","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31357933","name":"Cut-C"}}
