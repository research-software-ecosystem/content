      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | cleavage under tethered nuclease for conformational capture | BACKGROUND:Deciphering the 3D structure of the genome is essential for elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in detail. Existing methods, such as chromosome conformation capture (3C) and Hi-C have enabled the identification of novel aspects of chromatin structure. Further identification of protein-centric chromatin conformation is enabled by coupling the Hi-C procedure with a conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. However, these methods are time-consuming and require independent methods for validation. RESULTS:To simultaneously identify protein-centric chromatin conformation and target protein localization, we have developed Cut-C, a method that combines antibody-mediated cleavage by tethered nuclease with chromosome conformation capture to identify chromatin interactions mediated by a protein of interest",
