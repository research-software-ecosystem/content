The evolutionary variation of RNases results in differential structures and functions of the enzymes. To distinguish the characteristics of each RNase, we developed reinforced merging algorithms (RMA) to rapidly identify the unique peptide motifs for each member of the highly conserved human RNaseA superfamily. Many motifs in RNase3 identified by RMA correlated well with the antigenic regions predicted by DNAStar. Two unique peptide motifs were experimentally confirmed to contain epitopes for monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specifically against RNase3. Further analysis of homologous RNases in different species revealed that the unique peptide motifs were located at the correspondent positions, and one of these motifs indeed matched the epitope for a specific anti-bovine pancreatic RNaseA (bpRNaseA) antibody. Our method provides a useful tool for identification of unique peptide motifs for further experimental design. \u00a9 Imperial College Press.",

Different levels of uniqueness are determined according to substitutional relationship in the amino acids, frequency of appearance and biological properties such as priority for serving as candidates for epitopes where antibodies recognize. REMUS also provides interactive visualization of 3D structures for allocation and comparison of the identified unique peptide segments. Accuracy of the algorithm was found to be 70% in terms of mapping a unique peptide segment as an epitope.

                "abstract": "Background: Members of a protein family often have highly conserved sequences; most of these sequences carry identical biological functions and possess similar three-dimensional (3-D) structures. However, enzymes with high sequence identity may acquire differential functions other than the common catalytic ability. It is probable that each of their variable regions consists of a unique peptide motif (UPM), which selectively interacts with other cellular proteins, rendering additional biological activities. The ability to identify and localize such UPMs is paramount in recognizing the characteristic role of each member of a protein family. Results: We have developed a reinforced merging algorithm (RMA) with which non-gapped UPMs were identified in a variety of query protein sequences including members of human ribonuclease A (RNaseA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Smaand-Mad related protein families (Smad). The UPMs generally occupy specific positions in the resolved 3-D structures, especially the loop regions on the structural surfaces. These motifs coincide with the recognition sites for antibodies, as the epitopes of four monoclonal antibodies and two polyclonal antibodies were shown to overlap with the UPMs. Most of the UPMs were found to correlate well with the potential antigenic regions predicted by PROTEAN. Furthermore, an accuracy of 70% can be achieved in terms of mapping a UPM to an epitope. Conclusion: Our study provides a bioinformatic approach for searching and predicting potential epitopes and interacting motifs that distinguish different members of a protein family. \u00a9 2006 Chang et al; license BioMed Central Ltd.",
