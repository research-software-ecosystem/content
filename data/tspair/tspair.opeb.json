TSPs have two main advantages over many standard classifiers used in gene expression studies: (i) a TSP is based on only two genes, which leads to easily interpretable and inexpensive diagnostic tests and (ii) TSP classifiers are based on gene rankings, so they are more robust to variation in technical factors or normalization than classifiers based on expression levels of individual genes. Here I describe the R package, tspair, which can be used to quickly identify and assess TSP classifiers for gene expression data. © 2009 The Author(s).","authors":["Leek J.T."],"cit_count":22,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btp126","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"The tspair package for finding top scoring pair classifiers in R","type":"Primary","year":"2009-05-07"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tspair","biotoolsID":"tspair","description":"These functions calculate the pair of genes that show the maximum difference in ranking between two user specified groups. This \"top scoring pair\" maximizes the average of sensitivity and specificity over all rank based classifiers using a pair of genes in the data set. The advantage of this method is that the classifiers are much simpler and often easily interpretable and if arrays can be classified using only a pair of genes, PCR based tests could be used for classification of samples.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/tspair.html","name":"tspair","version":["1.36.0"]}}
