      "sc:description": "A Computational Platform Using Residual Dipolar Coupling NMR Data for Determining Structures of Perdeuterated Proteins Without NOEs.\n\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the two primary experimental means of characterizing macromolecular structures, including protein structures. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy has traditionally relied heavily on distance restraints derived from nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements. While structure determination of proteins from NOE-based restraints is well understood and broadly used, structure determination by NOEs imposes increasing quantity of data for analysis, increased cost of structure determination and is less available in the study of perdeuterated proteins. In the recent decade, Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) have been investigated as an alternative source of data for structural elucidation of proteins by NMR",
