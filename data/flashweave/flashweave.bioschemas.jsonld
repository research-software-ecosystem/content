  "sc:description": "Rapid Inference of Direct Interactions in Large-Scale Ecological Networks from Heterogeneous Microbial Sequencing Data | Inference of microbial interaction networks from large-scale heterogeneous abundance data | FlashWeave predicts ecological interactions between microbes from large-scale compositional abundance data (i.e. OTU tables constructed from sequencing data) through statistical co-occurrence or co-abundance. It reports direct associations, with adjustment for bystander effects and other confounders, and can furthermore integrate environmental or technical factors into the analysis of microbial systems",
