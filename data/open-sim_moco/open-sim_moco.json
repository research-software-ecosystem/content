    "description": "Musculoskeletal optimal control.\n\nOpenSim Moco solves optimal control problems with musculoskeletal models defined in OpenSim, using direct collocation.\n\nOpenSim Moco is a software toolkit to solve optimal control problems with musculoskeletal models defined in OpenSim, including those with kinematic constraints. Using the direct collocation method, Moco can solve a wide range of problems, including motion tracking, motion prediction, and parameter optimization. The design of Moco focuses on ease-of-use, customizability, and extensibility. Just like OpenSim itself, Moco has interfaces in XML/command-line, Matlab, Python, Java, and C++.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Moco'",
