      "sc:description": "An interactive online consensus survival tool for uveal melanoma prognosis analysis.\n\nUveal melanoma (UM) is a rare, aggressive, but the most frequent primary intraocular malignancy in adults, and up to 50% of patients develop a tendency of liver metastases. Great efforts have been made to develop biomarkers that facilitate diagnosis, prediction of the risk, and response to treatment of UM. However, a biologically informative and highly accurate gold standard system for prognostic evaluation of UM remains to be established. To facilitate assessment of the prognosis of UM patients, we established a user-friendly Online consensus Survival tool for uveal melanoma, named OSuvm, by which users can easily estimate the prognostic values of genes of interest by the Kaplan-Meier survival plot with hazard ratio and log-rank test.",
