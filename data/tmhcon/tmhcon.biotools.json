                "abstract": "Despite rapidly increasing numbers of available 3D structures, membrane proteins still account for less than 1% of all structures in the Protein Data Bank. Recent high-resolution structures indicate a clearly broader structural diversity of membrane proteins than initially anticipated, motivating the development of reliable structure prediction methods specifically tailored for this class of molecules. One important prediction target capturing all major aspects of a protein's 3D structure is its contact map. Our analysis shows that computational methods trained to predict residue contacts in globular proteins perform poorly when applied to membrane proteins. We have recently published a method to identify interacting \u03b1-helices in membrane proteins based on the analysis of coevolving residues in predicted transmembrane regions. Here, we present a substantially improved algorithm for the same problem, which uses a newly developed neural network approach to predict helix-helix contacts. In addition to the input features commonly used for contact prediction of soluble proteins, such as windowed residue profiles and residue distance in the sequence, our network also incorporates features that apply to membrane proteins only, such as residue position within the transmembrane segment and its orientation toward the lipophilic environment. The obtained neural network can predict contacts between residues in transmembrane segments with nearly 26% accuracy. It is therefore the first published contact predictor developed specifically for membrane proteins performing with equal accuracy to state-of-the-art contact predictors available for soluble proteins. The predicted helix-helix contacts were employed in a second step to identify interacting helices. For our dataset consisting of 62 membrane proteins of solved structure, we gained an accuracy of 78.1%. Because the reliable prediction of helix interaction patterns is an important step in the classification and prediction of membrane protein folds, our method will be a helpful tool in compiling a structural census of membrane proteins. \u00a9 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",
