The emerging interaction networks are usually modeled as graphs with thousands of nodes and tens of thousands of edges between them. In addition to sequence alignment, the comparison of biological networks has proven great potential to infer the biological function of proteins and genes. However, the corresponding network alignment problem is computationally hard and theoretically intractable for real world instances.","authors":["Ibragimov R.","Malek M.","Guo J.","Baumbach J."],"cit_count":20,"doi":"10.4230/OASIcs.GCB.2013.68","journal":"OpenAccess Series in Informatics","title":"GEDEVO: An evolutionary graph edit distance algorithm for biological network alignment","type":"Primary","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gedevo","biotoolsID":"gedevo","description":"Software tool for solving the network alignment problem.
