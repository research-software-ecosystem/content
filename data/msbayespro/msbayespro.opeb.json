In this article, we describe a novel Bayesian approach to address this challenge by incorporating the predicted peptide detectabilities as the prior probabilities of peptide identification. We propose a rigorious probabilistic model for protein inference and provide practical algoritmic solutions to this problem. We used a complex synthetic protein mixture to test our method and obtained promising results. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","authors":["Li Y.F.","Arnold R.J.","Li Y.","Radivojac P.","Sheng Q.","Tang H."],"cit_count":49,"journal":"Journal of Computational Biology","pmid":"19645593","title":"A bayesian approach to protein inference problem in shotgun proteomics","year":"2009-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msbayespro","biotoolsID":"msbayespro","description":"Software package and web tool for Bayesian protein inference from tandem mass spectrometry peptide identifications.
