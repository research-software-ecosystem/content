However, traditional identification methods are extremely time-consuming and can not obtain an accurate result. In this paper, we proposed a predictor called iDHS-DASTS to identify the DHS based on benchmark datasets. First, we adopt a feature extraction method called PseDNC which can incorporate the original DNA properties and spatial information of the DNA sequence. Then we use a method called LASSO to reduce the dimensions of the original data. Finally, we utilize stacking learning as a classifier, which includes Adaboost, random forest, gradient boosting, extra trees and SVM. Before we train the classifier, we use SMOTE-Tomek to overcome the imbalance of the datasets. In the experiment, our iDHS-DASTS achieves remarkable performance on three benchmark datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results with over 92.06%, 91.06% and 90.72% accuracy for datasets S1, S2and S3, respectively. To verify the validation and transferability of our model, we establish another independent dataset S4, for which the accuracy can reach 90.31%. Furthermore, we used the proposed model to construct a user friendly web server called iDHS-DASTS, which is available at http://www.xdu-duan.cn/",
