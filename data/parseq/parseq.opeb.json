Methods to analyze transcription level variations along the genome from the read count profiles generated by the RNA-Seq protocol are needed. Results: We developed a statistical approach to estimate the local transcription levels and to identify transcript borders. This transcriptional landscape reconstruction relies on a state-space model to describe transcription level variations in terms of abrupt shifts and more progressive drifts. A new emission model is introduced to capture not only the read count variance inside a transcript but also its short-range autocorrelation and the fraction of positions with zero counts. The estimation relies on a particle Gibbs algorithm whose running time makes it more suited to microbial genomes. The approach outperformed read-overlapping strategies on synthetic and real microbial datasets. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Mirauta B.","Nicolas P.","Richard H."],"cit_count":4,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24470570","title":"Parseq: Reconstruction of microbial transcription landscape from RNA-Seq read counts using state-space models","year":"2014-05-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:parseq","biotoolsID":"parseq","description":"Statistical approach for transcription landscape reconstruction at a basepair resolution from RNA Seq read counts.","homepage":"http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/parseq/","name":"Parseq"}}
