Apologies for the inconvenience, but for now expect some (= lots of) bugs & mistakes!.\n\nThe following are instructions to download and manipulate the metadata from the \"Mesophotic.org\" repository in R (https: www.r-project.org ).\n\nThe following graphs summarize the metadata across the 689 scientific articles in this database that are validated and present original data from mesophotic depths.\n\nBehind the science: Echinoderm diversity with new genera described in Rapa-Nui (Easter Island)",
