description: The package provides S4 classes and methods to filter, summarise and
  visualise genetic variation data stored in VCF files. In particular, the package
  extends the FilterRules class (S4Vectors package) to define news classes of filter
  rules applicable to the various slots of VCF objects. Functionalities are integrated
  and demonstrated in a Shiny web-application, the Shiny Variant Explorer (tSVE).
