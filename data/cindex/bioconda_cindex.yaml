description: The CINdex package addresses important area of high-throughput genomic
  analysis. It allows the automated processing and analysis of the experimental DNA
  copy number data generated by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays or similar high throughput
  technologies. It calculates the chromosome instability (CIN) index that allows to
  quantitatively characterize genome-wide DNA copy number alterations as a measure
  of chromosomal instability. This package calculates not only overall genomic instability,
  but also instability in terms of copy number gains and losses separately at the
  chromosome and cytoband level.
