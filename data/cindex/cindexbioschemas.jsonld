  "sc:description": "The package addresses important area of high-throughput genomic analysis. It allows the automated processing and analysis of the experimental DNA copy number data generated by Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays or similar. It calculates the chromosome instability index to quantitatively characterize genome-wide DNA copy number alterations. This package calculates not only overall genomic instability, but also instability in terms of copy number gains and losses at the chromosome and cytoband level.",
