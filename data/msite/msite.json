However, it is now obvious that transcriptional activity of nuclear receptors is a function of their interactions with co-activators. Recently, we released a new computational tool, CCOMP, for comparing side chain conformations in crystal structures of homologous protein complexes. Application of the CCOMP program revealed that 20-epi-1\u03b1,25-(OH)2D3 changes the side chain conformation of vitamin D receptor amino acids residing mostly far away from the ligand-receptor contacts. This strongly suggests that the ligand-co-activator signaling pathway involves indirect interactions between amino acids lining the binding pocket and outer surface residues that could attract co-activators. To facilitate identification of amino acids transmitting the subtle receptor changes upon ligand/modulator binding we developed another simple tool, MSITE. The program automatically lists the nearest neighbors of a given amino acid (for example neighbors of residues that are in contact with a ligand or reorient their side chains in the presence of a co-factor) in an arbitrary number of compared complexes. Comparison of seven binary vitamin D receptor complexes holding as ligands the analogs of 1\u03b1,25-(OH)2D3 with inverted configuration at carbon 14 or 20, or with incorporated oxolane ring bridging carbons 20 and 23, is reported. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Sicinska W."}, {"name": "Kurcinski M."}], "date": "2010-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Wanda Sicinska", "url": "http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/contact", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "wbs@icho.edu.pl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:msite", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/tools/msite", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Program designed to analyse structural data of liganded and unliganded proteins.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/msite-analyse-structural-data-of-liganded-and-unliganded-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "msite", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:50:09Z", "name": "MSITE", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/tools/msite", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
