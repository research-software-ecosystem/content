    "description": "ToxicoDB is a database of curated toxicogenomics datasets that provides convenient data summar and visualization to mine these complex data.\n\n\nA statistical analysis package for use exploring the relationship between toxicity and gene expression in specific cell types. The package includes a specialized object, the ToxicoSet, which allows unified storage of all data related to a specific toxico-genomic study. Methods accepting this object are inlcuded for summarize results and annotaiton, conduct various analyses as well as to visualize the results thereof.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.In the past few decades, major initiatives have been launched around the world to address chemical safety testing. These efforts aim to innovate and improve the efficacy of existing methods with the long-term goal of developing new risk assessment paradigms. The transcriptomic and toxicological profiling of mammalian cells has resulted in the creation of multiple toxicogenomic datasets and corresponding tools for analysis. To enable easy access and analysis of these valuable toxicogenomic data, we have developed ToxicoDB (toxicodb.ca), a free and open cloud-based platform integrating data from large in vitro toxicogenomic studies, including gene expression profiles of primary human and rat hepatocytes treated with 231 potential toxicants. To efficiently mine these complex toxicogenomic data, ToxicoDB provides users with harmonized chemical annotations, time- and dose-dependent plots of compounds across datasets, as well as the toxicity-related pathway analysis. The data in ToxicoDB have been generated using our open-source R package, ToxicoGx (github.com/bhklab/ToxicoGx). Altogether, ToxicoDB provides a streamlined process for mining highly organized, curated, and accessible toxicogenomic data that can be ultimately applied to preclinical toxicity studies and further our understanding of adverse outcomes.",
