      "sc:description": "A 3-dimensional clustering package for single-molecule localization microscopy | Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) yields an image resolution 1-2 orders of magnitude below that of conventional light microscopy, resolving fine details on intracellular structure and macromolecular organization. The massive pointillistic data sets generated by SMLM require the development of new and highly efficient quantification tools. Density based clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN, can provide spatial statistics on protein nucleic acid aggregation or dispersion while explicitly identifying macromolecular clusters. The performance of DBSCAN, however, is typically dependent upon an arbitrary, or at least highly subjective, parametric tuning of the algorithm. Moreover, DBSCAN can be computationally expensive, which makes it arduous to evaluate on large image stacks",
