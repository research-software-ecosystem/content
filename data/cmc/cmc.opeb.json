Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals. © 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","authors":["De Hoon M.J.L.","Taft R.J.","Hashimoto T.","Kanamori-Katayama M.","Kawaji H.","Kawano M.","Kishima M.","Lassmann T.","Faulkner G.J.","Mattick J.S.","Daub C.O.","Carninci P.","Kawai J.","Suzuki H.","Hayashizaki Y."],"cit_count":96,"doi":"10.1101/gr.095273.109","journal":"Genome Research","title":"Cross-mapping and the identification of editing sites in mature microRNAs in high-throughput sequencing libraries","type":"Primary","year":"2010-02-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cmc","biotoolsID":"cmc","description":"Cross-mapping Correction is a set of modern high-throughput technologies which enable deep sequencing of non-coding RNA species on an unprecedented scale.
