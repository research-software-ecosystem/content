  "sc:description": "Cross-mapping Correction is a set of modern high-throughput technologies which enable deep sequencing of non-coding RNA species on an unprecedented scale. When mapping such small RNAs to the genome, cross-mapping may occur, in which RNA sequences originating from one genomic locus are inadvertently mapped to a different locus. This may give rise to spurious novel RNAs, as well as spurious editing sites in known miRNAs.",
