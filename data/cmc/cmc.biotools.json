    "description": "Cross-mapping Correction is a set of modern high-throughput technologies which enable deep sequencing of non-coding RNA species on an unprecedented scale. When mapping such small RNAs to the genome, cross-mapping may occur, in which RNA sequences originating from one genomic locus are inadvertently mapped to a different locus. This may give rise to spurious novel RNAs, as well as spurious editing sites in known miRNAs.",

                "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-23 nt) RNAs that are sequence-specific mediators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Modern high-throughput technologies enable deep sequencing of such RNA species on an unprecedented scale. We find that the analysis of small RNA deep-sequencing libraries can be affected by cross-mapping, in which RNA sequences originating from one locus are inadvertently mapped to another. Similar to cross-hybridization on microarrays, cross-mapping is prevalent among miRNAs, as they tend to occur in families, are similar or derived from repeat or structural RNAs, or are post-transcriptionally modified. Here, we develop a strategy to correct for cross-mapping, and apply it to the analysis of RNA editing in mature miRNAs. In contrast to previous reports, our analysis suggests that RNA editing in mature miRNAs is rare in animals. \u00a9 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.",
