While long-read technologies have made the high-quality assembly of small, microbial genomes increasingly feasible, data generation can be expensive for larger genomes. OPERA-LG is a scalable, exact algorithm for the scaffold assembly of large, repeat-rich genomes, out-performing state-of-the-art programs for scaffold correctness and contiguity. It provides a rigorous framework for scaffolding of repetitive sequences and a systematic approach for combining data from different second-generation and third-generation sequencing technologies. OPERA-LG provides an avenue for systematic augmentation and improvement of thousands of existing draft eukaryotic genome assemblies.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Gao S."}, {"name": "Bertrand D."}, {"name": "Chia B.K.H."}, {"name": "Nagarajan N."}], "date": "2016-05-11T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/operasf/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:opera-lg", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/operasf/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Scaffolding", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3216"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2020-01-19T17:47:47Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Scalable, exact algorithm for the scaffold assembly of large, repeat-rich genomes, out-performing state-of-the-art programs for scaffold correctness and contiguity.
