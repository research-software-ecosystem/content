SGTPy allows to work with pure fluids and fluid mixtures, additionally the fluids can be modeled considering association, cross-association and polar contributions. SGTPy was built on top of phasepy's phase equilibrium and Square Gradient Theory (SGT) functions. These functions were updated to speed-up calculations of associative mixtures.",
