This study presents a new software tool, Novor, to greatly improve both the speed and accuracy of today's peptide de novo sequencing analyses. To improve the accuracy, Novor's scoring functions are based on two large decision trees built from a peptide spectral library with more than 300,000 spectra with machine learning. Important knowledge about peptide fragmentation is extracted automatically from the library and incorporated into the scoring functions. The decision tree model also enables efficient score calculation and contributes to the speed improvement. To further improve the speed, a two-stage algorithmic approach, namely dynamic programming and refinement, is used. The software program was also carefully optimized. On the testing datasets, Novor sequenced 7%-37% more correct residues than the state-of-the-art de novo sequencing tool, PEAKS, while being an order of magnitude faster. Novor can de novo sequence more than 300 MS/MS spectra per second on a laptop computer. The speed surpasses the acquisition speed of today's mass spectrometer and, therefore, opens a new possibility to de novo sequence in real time while the spectrometer is acquiring the spectral data.","authors":["Ma B."],"cit_count":54,"journal":"Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry","pmid":"26122521","title":"Novor: Real-Time Peptide de Novo Sequencing Software","year":"2015-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:novor","biotoolsID":"novor","description":"Fast, real-time peptide ''de novo'' sequencing engine.","homepage":"https://www.rapidnovor.com/","name":"Novor"}}
