  description: bisulfite read mapper and methylation caller
  long_description: " Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads\
    \ to a\n genome of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step. The\n\
    \ output can be easily imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and\n enables\
    \ a researcher to analyse the methylation levels of their samples\n straight away.\
    \ It's main features are:\n .\n  * Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in\
    \ one single step\n  * Supports single-end and paired-end read alignments\n  *\
    \ Supports ungapped and gapped alignments\n  * Alignment seed length, number of\
    \ mismatches etc. are adjustable\n  * Output discriminates between cytosine methylation\
    \ in CpG, CHG and\n    CHH context"
