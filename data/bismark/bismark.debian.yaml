  description: bisulfite read mapper and methylation caller
  long_description: " Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads
    to a\n genome of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step. The\n\
    \ output can be easily imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and\n enables
    a researcher to analyse the methylation levels of their samples\n straight away.
    It's main features are:\n .\n  * Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in
    one single step\n  * Supports single-end and paired-end read alignments\n  * Supports
    ungapped and gapped alignments\n  * Alignment seed length, number of mismatches
    etc. are adjustable\n  * Output discriminates between cytosine methylation in
    CpG, CHG and\n    CHH context"
