summary: Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a genome
  of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step. The output can be easily
  imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and enables a researcher to analyse
  the methylation levels of their samples straight away.
