Prediction of protein complexes' stability is an interesting topic in the field of structural biology. There are some promising published computational approaches that predict the affinity between subunits of protein dimers using 3D structures of both subunits. In the current study, we classify protein complexes with experimentally measured affinities into distinct classes with different mean affinities. By predicting the mechanical stiffness of the protein binding patch (PBP) region on a single subunit, we successfully predict the assigned affinity class of the PBP in the classification step. Now to predict the experimentally measured affinity between protein monomers in solution, we just need the 3D structure of the suggested PBP on one subunit of the proposed dimer. We designed the SEPAS software and have made the software freely available for academic non-commercial research purposes at \"http://biophysics.ir/affinity\". SEPAS predicts the stability of the intended dimer in a classwise manner by utilizing the computed mechanical stiffness of the introduced binding site on one subunit with the minimum accuracy of 0.72.",

Dimer state is considered as the primary alphabet of the most proteins\u2019 quaternary structure. The properties of binding interface between subunits and of noninterface region define the specificity and stability of the intended protein complex. Considering some topological properties and amino acids\u2019 affinity for binding in interfaces of protein dimers, we construct the interface-specific recurrence plots. The data obtained from recurrence quantitative analysis, and accessibility-related metrics help us to classify the protein dimers into four distinct classes. Some mechanical properties of binding interfaces are computed for each predefined class of the dimers. The computed mechanical characteristics of binding patch region are compared with those of nonbinding region of proteins. Our observations indicate that the mechanical properties of protein binding sites have a decisive impact on determining the dimer stability. We introduce a new concept in analyzing protein structure by considering mechanical properties of protein structure. We conclude that the interface region between subunits of stable dimers is usually mechanically softer than the interface of unstable protein dimers.
