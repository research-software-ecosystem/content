Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and ChIP followed by genomic tiling microarray hybridization (ChIP-chip) are the two of the most widely used technologies for genome-wide identification of DNA protein interactions and histone modification in vivo. Many algorithms and tools have been developed and evaluated that allow identification of transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets. However, binding site identification is only the first step; the ultimate goal is to discover the regulatory network of the transcription factor (TF). Here, we present a common workflow for downstream analysis of ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq with an emphasis on annotating binding sites and integration with gene expression data to identify direct and indirect targets of the TF. These tools will help with the overall goal of unraveling transcriptional regulatory networks using datasets publicly available in GEO. \u00a9 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.", "citationCount": 20, "authors": [{"name": "Zhu L.J."}], "date": "2013-09-20T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jianhong Ou", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jianhong.ou@umassmed.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:genenetworkbuilder", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.16.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneNetworkBuilder.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3439"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Appliation for discovering direct or indirect targets of transcription factors using ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq, and microarray or RNA-seq gene expression data.
