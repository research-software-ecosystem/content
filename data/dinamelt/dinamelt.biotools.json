In a sequence-dependent manner, oligomers bind up to 1000- fold more tightly adjacent to the hairpin stem than predicted for binding to a free tetramer at 37°C. For the interface (/) in 5'-GGAC G- ACCUG/C-/X Z, where X and Z are unpaired nucleotides, the additional free energy change, ΔΔG37/°, for binding is roughly the nearest-neighbor ΔG37/° for propagation of an uninterrupted helix of equivalent sequence, CG/GC. When X and Z are omitted, the ΔΔG37/° is even more favorable by ≃1 kcal/mol (1 cal = 4.184J). On average, predictions of 11 RNA secondary structures improve from 67 to 74% accuracy by inclusion of similar stacking contributions.",

                "abstract": "The DINAMelt web server simulates the melting of one or two single-stranded nucleic acids in solution. The goal is to predict not just a melting temperature for a hybridized pair of nucleic acids, but entire equilibrium melting profiles as a function of temperature. The two molecules are not required to be complementary, nor must the two strand concentrations be equal. Competition among different molecular species is automatically taken into account. Calculations consider not only the heterodimer, but also the two possible homodimers, as well as the folding of each single-stranded molecule. For each of these five molecular species, free energies are computed by summing Boltzmann factors over every possible hybridized or folded state. For temperatures within a user-specified range, calculations predict species mole fractions together with the free energy, enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity of the ensemble. Ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 260 nm is simulated using published extinction coefficients and computed base pair probabilities. All results are available as text files and plots are provided for species concentrations, heat capacity and UV absorbance versus temperature. This server is connected to an active research program and should evolve as new theory and software are developed.

                "abstract": "This article presents a general statistical mechanical approach to describe self-folding together with the hybridization between a pair of finite length DNA or RNA molecules. The model takes into account the entire ensemble of single- and double-stranded species in solution and their mole fractions at different temperatures. The folding and hybridization models deal with matched pairs, mismatches, symmetric and asymmetric interior loops, bulges, and single-base stacking that might exist at duplex ends or at the ends of helices. All possible conformations of the single- and double-stranded species are explored. Only intermolecular basepairs are considered in duplexes at this stage. In particular we focus on the role of stacking between neighboring nucleotide residues of single unfolded strands as an important source of enthalpy change on helix formation which has not been modeled computationally thus far. Changes in the states of the single strands with temperature are shown to lead to a larger heat effect at higher temperature. An important consequence of this is that predictions of enthalpies, which are based on databases of nearest-neighbor energy parameters determined for molecules or duplexes with lower melting temperatures compared with the melting temperatures of the oligos for which they are used as a predictive tool, will be underestimated.",
