description: A comprehensive pipeline for analyzing and interactively visualizing
  genomic profiles generated through commercial or custom aCGH arrays. As inputs,
  rCGH supports Agilent dual-color Feature Extraction files (.txt), from 44 to 400K,
  Affymetrix SNP6.0 and cytoScanHD probeset.txt, cychp.txt, and cnchp.txt files exported
  from ChAS or Affymetrix Power Tools. rCGH also supports custom arrays, provided
  data complies with the expected format. This package takes over all the steps required
  for individual genomic profiles analysis, from reading files to profiles segmentation
  and gene annotations. This package also provides several visualization functions
  (static or interactive) which facilitate individual profiles interpretation. Input
  files can be in compressed format, e.g. .bz2 or .gz.
