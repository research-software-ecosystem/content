In this work, I have related the protein folding rates with physical-chemical, energetic and conformational properties of amino acid residues. I found that the classification of proteins into different structural classes shows an excellent correlation between amino acid properties and folding rates of two-and three-state proteins, indicating the importance of native state topology in determining the protein folding rates. I have formulated a simple linear regression model for predicting the protein folding rates from amino acid sequences along with structural class information and obtained an excellent agreement between predicted and experimentally observed folding rates of proteins; the correlation coefficients are 0.99, 0.96 and 0.95, respectively, for all-α, all-β and mixed class proteins. This is the first available method, which is capable of predicting the protein folding rates just from the amino acid sequence with the aid of generic amino acid properties and structural class information. © 2005 American Chemical Society.",

                "abstract": "The contact order is believed to be an important factor for understanding protein folding mechanisms. In our earlier work, we have shown that the long-range interactions play a vital role in protein folding. In this work, we analyzed the contribution of long-range contacts to determine the folding rate of two-state proteins. We found that the residues that are close in space and are separated by at least ten to 15 residues in sequence are important determinants of folding rates, suggesting the presence of a folding nucleus at an interval of approximately 25 residues. A novel parameter \"long-range order\" has been proposed to predict protein folding rates. This parameter shows as good a relationship with the folding rate of two-state proteins as contact order. Further, we examined the minimum limit of residue separation to determine the long-range contacts for different structural classes. We observed an excellent correlation between long-range order and folding rate for all classes of globular proteins. We suggest that in mixed-class proteins, a larger number of residues can serve as folding nuclei compared to all-α and all-β proteins. A simple statistical method has been developed to predict the folding rates of two-state proteins using the long-range order that produces an agreement with experimental results that is better or comparable to other methods in the literature. © 2001 Academic Press.",

                "abstract": "Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequences and folding rate of proteins is a challenging task similar to protein folding problem. In this work, we have analyzed the relative importance of protein sequence and structure for predicting the protein folding rates in terms of amino acid properties and contact distances, respectively. We found that the parameters derived with protein sequence (physical-chemical, energetic, and conformational properties of amino acid residues) show very weak correlation (|r| < 0.39) with folding rates of 28 two-state proteins, indicating that the sequence information alone is not sufficient to understand the folding rates of two-state proteins. However, the maximum positive correlation obtained for the properties, number of medium-range contacts, and α-helical tendency reveals the importance of local interactions to initiate protein folding. On the other hand, a remarkable correlation (r varies from -0.74 to -0.88) has been obtained between structural parameters (contact order, long-range order, and total contact distance) and protein folding rates. Further, we found that the secondary structure content and solvent accessibility play a marginal role in determining the folding rates of two-state proteins. Multiple regression analysis carried out with the combination of three properties, β-strand tendency, enthalpy change, and total contact distance improved the correlation to 0.92 with protein folding rates. The relative importance of existing methods along with multiple-regression model proposed in this work will be discussed. Our results demonstrate that the native-state topology is the major determinant for the folding rates of two-state proteins.",
