We investigated the effect of analyzing a spike-in experiment on Affymetrix ENCODE tiling arrays in the presence of simulated blobs covering between 1 and 9% of the array area. Using two different ChIP-chip tiling array analysis programs (Affymetrix tiling array software, TAS, and model-based analysis of tiling arrays, MAT), we found that even the smallest blob defects significantly decreased the sensitivity and increased the false discovery rate (FDR) of the spike-in target prediction. Results: We introduced a new software tool, the microarray blob remover (MBR), which allows rapid visualization, detection and removal of various blob defects from the CEL files of different types of Affymetrix microarrays. It is shown that using MBR significantly improves the sensitivity and FDR of a tiling array analysis compared to leaving the affected probes in the analysis. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 16, "authors": [{"name": "Song J.S."}, {"name": "Maghsoudi K."}, {"name": "Li W."}, {"name": "Fox E."}, {"name": "Quackenbush J."}, {"name": "Liu X.S."}], "date": "2007-04-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mbr", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["20070206"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://liulab.dfci.harvard.edu/Software/MBR/MBR.htm.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Microarray data analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Quality control", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Microarray Blob Remover is a microarray tool which allows rapid visualization, detection, and removalof blob-like defects as an initial quality control step.
