The software allows rapid visualization, detection, and removal of blob defects of a variety of sizes and shapes from different types of microarrays using their .CEL files. Removal of the affected probes in the blob-defects using MBR was shown to improve sensitivity and FDR compared to leaving the affected probes in the analysis.",
