PAI-WSIT allows you to store your Digital Pathology images into the cloud platform, search and view them in the browser. PAI-WSIT also provides a feature-rich online tool for annotating your digital slides. You can also view annotations drawn by other pathologists. For colorectal cancer, PAI-WSIT leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to detect abnormal regions in whole slide images. Results can be visualized in the form of heatmaps.",
