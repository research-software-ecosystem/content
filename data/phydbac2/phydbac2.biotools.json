                "abstract": "Phydbac (phylogenomic display of bacterial genes) implemented a method of phylogenomic profiling using a distance measure based on normalized BLAST scores. This method was able to increase the predictive power of phylogenomic profiling by about 25% when compared to the classical approach based on Hamming distances. Here we present a major-extension of Phydbac (named here Phydbac2), that extends both the concept and the functionality of the original web-service. While phylogenomic profiles remain the central focus of Phydbac2, it now integrates chromosomal proximity and gene fusion analyses as two additional non-similarity-based indicators for inferring pairwise gene functional relationships. Moreover, all presently available (January 2004) fully sequenced bacterial genomes and those of three lower eukaryotes are now included in the profiling process, thus increasing the initial number of reference genomes (71 in Phydbac) to 150 in Phydbac2. Using the KEGG metabolic pathway database as a benchmark, we show that the predictive power of Phydbac2 is improved by 27% over the previous version. This gain is accounted for on one hand, by the increased number of reference genomes (11%) and on the other hand, as a result of including chromosomal proximity into the distance measure (16%). The expanded functionality of Phydbac2 now allows the user to query more than 50 different genomes, including at least one member of each major bacterial group, most major pathogens and potential bio-terrorism agents. The search for co-evolving genes based on consensus profiles from multiple organisms, the display of Phydbac2 profiles side by side with COG information, the inclusion of KEGG metabolic pathway maps the production of chromosomal proximity maps, and the possibility of collecting and processing results from different Phydbac queries in a common shopping cart are the main new features of Phydbac2.

                "abstract": "Phydbac is a web interactive resource based on phylogenomic profiling, designed to help microbiologists to annotate bacterial proteins. Phylogenomic annotation is based on the assumption that functionally linked protein-coding genes must evolve in a coordinated manner. The detection of subsets of co-evolving genes within a given genome involves the computation of protein sequence conservation profiles across a spectrum of microbial species, followed by the identification of significant pairwise correlations between them. Many ongoing studies are devoted to the problem of computing the most biologically significant phylogenomic profiles and how best identifying clusters of 'functionally interacting' genes. Here we introduce a web tool, Phydbac, allowing the dynamic construction of phylogenomic profiles of protein sequences of interest and their interactive display. In addition, Phydbac can identify Escherichia coli proteins exhibiting the evolution pattern most similar to arbitrary query protein sequences, hence providing functional hints for open reading frames (ORFs) of hypothetical or unknown function. The phylogenomic profiles of all E.coli K-12 protein-coding genes are pre-computed, allowing queries about E.coli genes to be answered instantaneously. The profiles and phylogenomic neighborhoods are computed using an original method shown to perform better than previous ones. An extension of Phydbac, including precomputed profiles for all available bacterial genomes (including major pathogens) will soon be available. Phydbac can be accessed at: http://igs-server.cnrs-mrs.fr/phydbac/.",
