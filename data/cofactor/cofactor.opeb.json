Starting from a structural model, given by either experimental determination or computational modeling, COFACTOR first identifies template proteins of similar folds and functional sites by threading the target structure through three representative template libraries that have known protein-ligand binding interactions, Enzyme Commission number or Gene Ontology terms. The biological function insights in these three aspects are then deduced from the functional templates, the confidence of which is evaluated by a scoring function that combines both global and local structural similarities. The algorithm has been extensively benchmarked by large-scale benchmarking tests and demonstrated significant advantages compared to traditional sequence-based methods. In the recent community-wide CASP9 experiment, COFACTOR was ranked as the best method for protein-ligand binding site predictions.

Here, we report recent improvements of the COFACTOR server in the development of new pipelines to infer functional insights from sequence profile alignments and protein-protein interaction networks. Large-scale benchmark tests show that the new hybrid COFACTOR approach significantly improves the function annotation accuracy of the former structure-based pipeline and other state-of-the-art functional annotation methods, particularly for targets that have no close homology templates.
