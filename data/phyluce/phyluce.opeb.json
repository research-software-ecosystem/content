Published by Oxford University Press. Targeted enrichment of conserved and ultraconserved genomic elements allows universal collection of phylogenomic data from hundreds of species at multiple time scales (<5 Ma to > 300 Ma). Prior to downstream inference, data from these types of targeted enrichment studies must undergo preprocessing to assemble contigs from sequence data; identify targeted, enriched loci from the off-target background data; align enriched contigs representing conserved loci to one another; and prepare and manipulate these alignments for subsequent phylogenomic inference. PHYLUCE is an efficient and easy-to-install software package that accomplishes these tasks across hundreds of taxa and thousands of enriched loci.","authors":["Faircloth B.C."],"cit_count":88,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26530724","title":"PHYLUCE is a software package for the analysis of conserved genomic loci","year":"2015-05-08"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:phyluce","biotoolsID":"phyluce","description":"Software package that was initially developed for analyzing data collected from ultraconserved elements in organismal genomes.","homepage":"http://phyluce.readthedocs.org/en/latest/","name":"PHYLUCE"}}
