The dysfunction or mutation of lncRNAs are implicated in a wide range of diseases. An accurate computational model can benefit the diagnosis of diseases and help us to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanism. Although many related algorithms have been proposed, there is still much room to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: We developed a novel algorithm, BiWalkLDA, to predict disease-related lncRNAs in three real datasets, which have 528 lncRNAs, 545 diseases and 1216 interactions in total. To compare performance with other algorithms, the leave-one-out validation test was performed for BiWalkLDA and three other existing algorithms, SIMCLDA, LDAP and LRLSLDA. Additional tests were carefully designed to analyze the parameter effects such as \u03b1, \u03b2, l and r, which could help user to select the best choice of these parameters in their own application. In a case study of prostate cancer, eight out of the top-ten disease-related lncRNAs reported by BiWalkLDA were previously confirmed in literatures. Conclusions: In this paper, we develop an algorithm, BiWalkLDA, to predict lncRNA-disease association by using bi-random walks. It constructs a lncRNA-disease network by integrating interaction profile and gene ontology information. Solving cold-start problem by using neighbors' interaction profile information. Then, bi-random walks was applied to three real biological datasets. Results show that our method outperforms other algorithms in predicting lncRNA-disease association in terms of both accuracy and specificity. Availability: https://github.com/screamer/BiwalkLDA",
