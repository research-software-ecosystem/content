      "sc:description": "3DeFDR is a statistical methods for identifying cell type-specific looping interactions in 5C and Hi-C data.\n\nAn important unanswered question in chromatin biology is the extent to which long-range looping interactions change across developmental models, genetic perturbations, drug treatments, and disease states. Computational tools for rigorous assessment of cell type-specific loops across multiple biological conditions are needed. We present 3DeFDR, a simple and effective statistical tool for classifying dynamic loops across biological conditions from Chromosome-Conformation-Capture-Carbon-Copy (5C) and Hi-C data. Our work provides a statistical framework and open-source coding libraries for sensitive detection of cell type-specific loops in high-resolution 5C and Hi-C data from multiple cellular conditions",
