The technique relies on the repeated application of an oriented electron-density likelihood target function to identify likely Cα positions. This function is applied both in the location of a few promising 'seed' positions in the map and to grow those initial Cα positions into extended chain fragments. Techniques for assembling the chain fragments into an initial chain trace are discussed. © 2006 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.","authors":["Cowtan K."],"cit_count":1047,"journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography","pmid":"16929101","title":"The Buccaneer software for automated model building. 1.
