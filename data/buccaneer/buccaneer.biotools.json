The technique relies on the repeated application of an oriented electron-density likelihood target function to identify likely C\u03b1 positions. This function is applied both in the location of a few promising 'seed' positions in the map and to grow those initial C\u03b1 positions into extended chain fragments. Techniques for assembling the chain fragments into an initial chain trace are discussed. \u00a9 2006 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.",
