Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Several high-throughput technologies have been developed to probe RNA base pairs and loops at the transcriptome level in multiple species. However, to obtain the final RNA secondary structure, extensive effort and considerable expertise is required to statistically process the probing data and combine them with free energy models. Therefore, we developed an RNA secondary structure prediction server that is enhanced by experimental data (RNAex). RNAex is a web interface that enables non-specialists to easily access cutting-edge structure-probing data and predict RNA secondary structures enhanced by in vivo and in vitro data. RNAex annotates the RNA editing, RNA modification and SNP sites on the predicted structures. It provides four structure-folding methods, restrained MaxExpect, SeqFold, RNAstructure (Fold) and RNAfold that can be selected by the user. The performance of these four folding methods has been verified by previous publications on known structures. We re-mapped the raw sequencing data of the probing experiments to the whole genome for each species. RNAex thus enables users to predict secondary structures for both known and novel RNA transcripts in human, mouse, yeast and Arabidopsis The RNAex web server is available at http://RNAex.ncrnalab.org/.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Wu Y."}, {"name": "Qu R."}, {"name": "Huang Y."}, {"name": "Shi B."}, {"name": "Liu M."}, {"name": "Li Y."}, {"name": "Lu Z.J."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://lulab.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/RNAex/contact.php", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "lulab@biomed.tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rnaex", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lulab.life.tsinghua.edu.cn/RNAex/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0278"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An RNA secondary structure prediction server enhanced by high-throughput structure probing data.
