Methods: A two-year retrospective review of all patients who presented to the rural vision centers of LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI) eyecare network was performed from September 2016 to August 2018 using an in-house developed eyeSmart EMR app. Results: A total of 501 771 patients were captured on the eyeSmart EMR app across the LVPEI network. The ratio of males (n=273 985, 54.60%) and females (n=227 786, 45.40%) presenting to the rural vision centers was 1.2:1. The most prevalent ocular disorder was refractive errors (n=273 720, 44.32%). Conclusions: This study details the demographic distribution and prevalence of ocular disorders in a large cohort of Indian patients and demonstrates the potential for real-time analytics through the use of EMR systems. This provides rigorous evidence for the community and eyecare providers that the use of a web application/tablet app (eyeSmart) aids in providing better eyecare services in rural areas. It helps in creating government policies and improves the treatment strategies for various preventable ocular disorders in India.",
