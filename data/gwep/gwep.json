    "description": "PARTNERING IN GERIATRICS WORKFORCE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAMS.\n\nEDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF DEMENTIA CAREGIVER CONFERENCES IN RURAL UTAH.\n\nAbstractTo achieve their healthcare system transformational goals to improve care for older adults, Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Programs (GWEPs) facilitate the building of strong relationships among academia, community-based organizations, and primary care networks. Each GWEP develops strategies to formalize collaborations and build sustainable networks to meet program goals while addressing partner needs. Unique models from four GWEPs addressing stakeholder engagement are described, and factors facilitating collaboration are explored. One GWEP achieves mutual goals by collaborating with statewide coalitions that have a history of successful partnerships.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GERIATRIC WORKFORCE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM', 'caregiver', 'ADKS', 'dementia'",
