Each GWEP develops strategies to formalize collaborations and build sustainable networks to meet program goals while addressing partner needs. Unique models from four GWEPs addressing stakeholder engagement are described, and factors facilitating collaboration are explored. One GWEP achieves mutual goals by collaborating with statewide coalitions that have a history of successful partnerships.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GERIATRIC WORKFORCE ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM', 'caregiver', 'ADKS', 'dementia'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6845271/","name":"GWEP"}}
