In the field of protein engineering, structural motif identification is essential to select protein scaffolds on which a motif of residues can be transferred to design a new protein with a given function. We describe here the RASMOT-3D PRO webserver (http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/ rasmot3d/) that performs a systematic search in 3D structures of protein for a set of residues exhibiting a particular topology. Comparison is based on C\u03b1 and C\u03b2 atoms in two steps: inter-atomic distances and RMSD. RASMOT-3D PRO takes in input a PDB file containing the 3D coordinates of the searched motif and provides an interactive list of identified protein structures exhibiting residues of similar topology as the motif searched. Each solution can be graphically examined on the website. The topological search can be conducted in structures described in PDB files uploaded by the user or in those deposited in the PDB. This characteristic as well as the possibility to reject scaffolds sterically incompatible with the target, makes RASMOT-3D PRO a unique webtool in the field of protein engineering.", "citationCount": 23, "authors": [{"name": "Debret G."}, {"name": "Martel A."}, {"name": "Cuniasse P."}], "date": "2009-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Philippe Cuniasse", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "philippe.cuniasse@cea.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rasmot-3d_pro", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://biodev.extra.cea.fr/rasmot3d/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein model validation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0321"}, {"term": "Protein structural motif recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0245"}, {"term": "Protein structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2487"}, {"term": "Sequence motif recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0239"}, {"term": "Residue distance calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2950"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The RASMOT-3D PRO web server performs systematic searches in 3D protein structures for a set of residues exhibiting a particular topology.
