    "description": "A collective database of helmeted guinea fowl genomics.\n\nHelmeted guinea fowl (HGF; Numida meleagris) is vigorous, hardy, and mostly disease-free game birds. The rearing of HGF is a potential alternative poultry system. Because of the characteristics of the HGF, the study of HGF is valuable, so we conduct an improved domesticated HGF genome de novo assembly generated by long and short read sequencing together with optical and chromatin interaction mapping. Using this assembly as the reference, we performed population genomic analyses for newly sequenced whole-genomes for 129 birds including domesticated animals, wild progenitors, and closely related wild species. The data are important to provide valuable genetic resources for researchers and breeders to improve production in this species. For this purpose, we have developed a comprehensive and easy-to-use web-based database, HGFDB.",

                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press.As a vigorous and hardy and an almost disease-free game bird, the domestic helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris, hereafter HGF) has attracted considerable attention in a large number of genetic study projects. However, none of the current/recent avian databases are related to this agriculturally and commercially important poultry species. To address this data gap, we developed Helmeted Guinea Fowl Database (HGFDB), which manages and shares HGF genomic and genetic data. By processing the data of genome assembly, sequencing reads and genetic variations, we organized them into eight modules, which correspond to 'Home', 'Genome', 'Re-sequence', 'Gene', 'Variation', 'Download', 'Tools' and 'Help', HGFDB provides the most comprehensive view of the HGF genome to date and will be relevant for future studies on HGF structural and functional genomics and genetic improvement.
