The major conceptual change since 3 years ago is an expanded biological context so that transcriptional regulation is now part of a unit that initiates with the signal and continues with the signal transduction to the core of regulation, modifying expression of the affected target genes responsible for the response. We call these genetic sensory response units, or Gensor Units. We have initiated their high-level curation, with graphic maps and superreactions with links to other databases. Additional connectivity uses expandable submaps. RegulonDB has summaries for every transcription factor (TF) and TF-binding sites with internal symmetry. Several DNA-binding motifs and their sizes have been redefined and relocated. In addition to data from the literature, we have incorporated our own information on transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcriptional units (TUs), obtained by using high-throughput whole-genome sequencing technologies. A new portable drawing tool for genomic features is also now available, as well as new ways to download the data, including web services, files for several relational database manager systems and text files including BioPAX format. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Gama-Castro S.","Salgado H.","Peralta-Gil M.","Santos-Zavaleta A.","Muniz-Rascado L.","Solano-Lira H.","Jimenez-Jacinto V.","Weiss V.","Garcia-Sotelo J.S.","Lopez-Fuentes A.","Porron-Sotelo L.","Alquicira-Hernandez S.","Medina-Rivera A.","Martinez-Flores I.","Alquicira-Hernandez K.","Martinez-Adame R.","Bonavides-Martinez C.","Miranda-Rios J.","Huerta A.M.","Mendoza-Vargas A.","Collado-Torres L.","Taboada B.","Vega-Alvarado L.","Olvera M.","Olvera L.","Grande R.","Morett E.","Collado-Vides J."],"cit_count":257,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21051347","title":"RegulonDB version 7.0: Transcriptional regulation of Escherichia coli K-12 integrated within genetic sensory response units (Gensor Units)","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:regulondb","biotoolsID":"regulondb","description":"It is a reference database of Escherichia coli K-12.
