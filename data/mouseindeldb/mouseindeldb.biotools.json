The database currently includes polymorphisms identified from our alignment of 26 million whole-genome shotgun sequence traces from four laboratory mouse strains mapped against the reference C57BL/6J genome using GMAP. They can be queried on a local level by chromosomal coordinates, nearby gene names or other genomic feature identifiers, or in bulk format using categories including mouse strain(s), class of polymorphism(s) and chromosome number. The results of such queries are presented either as a custom track on the UCSC mouse genome browser or in tabular format. We anticipate that the MouseIndelDB database will be widely useful for research in mammalian genetics, genomics, and evolutionary biology.
