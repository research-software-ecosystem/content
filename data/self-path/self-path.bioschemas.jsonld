      "sc:description": "Self-supervision for Classification of Pathology Images with Limited Annotations.\n\nWhile high-resolution pathology images lend themselves well to 'data hungry' deep learning algorithms, obtaining exhaustive annotations on these images for learning is a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) frame-work to leverage unlabeled data for learning generalizable and domain invariant representations in pathology images. Our proposed framework, termed as Self-Path, employs multi-task learning where the main task is tissue classification and pretext tasks are a variety of self-supervised tasks with labels inherent to the input images. We introduce novel pathology-specific self-supervision tasks that leverage contextual, multi-resolution and semantic features in pathology images for semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation. We investigate the effectiveness of Self-Path on 3 different pathology datasets\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
