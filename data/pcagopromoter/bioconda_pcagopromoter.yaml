description: This package contains functions to ease the analyses of DNA micro arrays.
  It utilizes principal component analysis as the initial multivariate analysis, followed
  by functional interpretation of the principal component dimensions with overrepresentation
  analysis for GO terms and regulatory interpretations using overrepresentation analysis
  of predicted transcription factor binding sites with the primo algorithm.
