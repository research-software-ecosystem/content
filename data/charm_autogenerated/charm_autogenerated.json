    "description": "The charming code that error messages are talking about.\n\nThe intent of high test coverage is to ensure that the dark nooks and crannies of code are exercised and tested. In a language like Python this is especially important as syntax errors can lurk in unevaluated blocks, only to be discovered once they are finally executed. Bugs that present themselves as error messages mentioning a line of code which is unrelated to the cause of the bug can be difficult and time-consuming to fix when a developer must first determine the actual location of the fault. A new code metric, charm, is presented.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/charm.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'charm cyclomatic', 'release-quality', 'cyclomatic', 'Python'",
