                "abstract": "Phylogenetic trees and data are often stored in incompatible and inconsistent formats. The outputs of software tools that contain trees with analysis findings are often not compatible with each other, making it hard to integrate the results of different analyses in a comparative study. The treeio package is designed to connect phylogenetic tree input and output. It supports extracting phylogenetic trees as well as the outputs of commonly used analytical software. It can link external data to phylogenies and merge tree data obtained from different sources, enabling analyses of phylogeny-associated data from different disciplines in an evolutionary context. Treeio also supports export of a phylogenetic tree with heterogeneous-associated data to a single tree file, including BEAST compatible NEXUS and jtree formats; these facilitate data sharing as well as file format conversion for downstream analysis. The treeio package is designed to work with the tidytree and ggtree packages. Tree data can be processed using the tidy interface with tidytree and visualized by ggtree. The treeio package is released within the Bioconductor and rOpenSci projects. It is available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/.",
