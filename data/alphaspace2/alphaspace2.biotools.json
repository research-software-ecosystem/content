                "abstract": "Copyright \u00a9 2020 American Chemical Society.Modern rational modulator design and structure-function characterization often concentrate on concave regions of biomolecular surfaces, ranging from well-defined small-molecule binding sites to large protein-protein interaction interfaces. Here, we introduce a \u03b2-cluster as a pseudomolecular representation of fragment-centric pockets detected by AlphaSpace [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2015, 55, 1585], a recently developed computational analysis tool for topographical mapping of biomolecular concavities. By mimicking the shape as well as atomic details of potential molecular binders, this new \u03b2-cluster representation allows direct pocket-to-ligand shape comparison and can be used to guide ligand optimization. Furthermore, we defined the \u03b2-score, the optimal Vina score of the \u03b2-cluster, as an indicator of pocket ligandability and developed an ensemble \u03b2-cluster approach, which allows one-to-one pocket mapping and comparison among aligned protein structures. We demonstrated the utility of \u03b2-cluster representation by applying the approach to a wide variety of problems including binding site detection and comparison, characterization of protein-protein interactions, and fragment-based ligand optimization. These new \u03b2-cluster functionalities have been implemented in AlphaSpace 2.0, which is freely available on the web at http://www.nyu.edu/projects/yzhang/AlphaSpace2.",
