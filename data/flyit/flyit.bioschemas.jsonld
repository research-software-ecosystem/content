      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Drosophila Embryogenesis Image Annotation based on Image Tiling and Convolutional Neural Networks | With the rise of image-based transcriptomics, spatial gene expression data has become increasingly important for understanding gene regulations from the tissue level down to the cell level. Especially, the gene expression images of Drosophila embryos provide a new data source in the study of Drosophila embryogenesis. It is imperative to develop automatic annotation tools since manual annotation is labor-intensive and requires professional knowledge. Although a lot of image annotation methods have been proposed in the computer vision field, they may not work well for gene expression images, due to the great difference between these two annotation tasks. Besides the apparent difference on images, the annotation is performed at the gene level rather than the image level, where the expression patterns of a gene are recorded in multiple images",
