description: 'Canu is a fork of the Celera Assembler, designed for high-noise single-molecule
  sequencing (such as the PacBio RS II or Oxford Nanopore MinION). . Canu is a hierarchical
  assembly pipeline which runs in four steps: . * Detect overlaps in high-noise sequences
  using MHAP * Generate corrected sequence consensus * Trim corrected sequences *
  Assemble trimmed corrected sequences'
