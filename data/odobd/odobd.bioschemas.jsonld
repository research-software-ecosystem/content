Situated in the South-east Asia, Bangladesh is gifted with the rich network of water resources like ponds, lakes, marshes, rivers, streams and mangrove swamps. This diverse range of water bodies along with many tropical forest patches has generated suitable habitat for many Odonata species. Till date, nearly hundred species of Odonates have been recorded from Bangladesh.\n\nThe current project, supported by Rufford Small Grant, is designed to assemble and disseminate information of diversity, ecology and behavior of the Bangladeshi dragonflies and damselflies.",
