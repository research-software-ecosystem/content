Furthermore, RNA-Seq-based transcript profiling can be applied to non-model and newly discovered organisms because it does not require a predefined measuring platform (like e.g. microarrays). However, these novel technologies pose new challenges: the raw data need to be rigorously quality checked and filtered prior to analysis, and proper statistical methods have to be applied to extract biologically relevant information. Given the sheer volume of data, this is no trivial task and requires a combination of considerable technical resources along with bioinformatics expertise. To aid the individual researcher, we have developed RobiNA as an integrated solution that consolidates all steps of RNA-Seq-based differential gene-expression analysis in one user-friendly cross-platform application featuring a rich graphical user interface. RobiNA accepts raw FastQ files, SAM/BAM alignment files and counts tables as input. It supports quality checking, flexible filtering and statistical analysis of differential gene expression based on state-of-the art biostatistical methods developed in the R/Bioconductor projects. In-line help and a step-by-step manual guide users through the analysis.
