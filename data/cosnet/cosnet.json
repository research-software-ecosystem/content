In this context, classes are usually characterized by a high imbalance, i.e. positive examples for a class are much less than those negative. Although several works studied this problem, no graph-based software designed to explicitly take into account the label imbalance in biological networks is available. We propose COSNet, an R package to serve this purpose. COSNet deals with the label imbalance problem by implementing a novel parametric model of Hopfield Network (HN), whose output levels and activation thresholds of neurons are parameters to be automatically learnt. Due to the quasi-linear time complexity, COSNet nicely scales when the number of instances is large, and application examples to challenging problems in biomedicine show the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed library.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Frasca M."}, {"name": "Valentini G."}], "date": "2017-05-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Neurocomputing"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Marco Frasca", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "frasca@di.unimi.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cosnet", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.8.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/COSNet.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Structure classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2996"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Package that implements the COSNet classification algorithm, which predicts node labels in partially labeled graphs where few positives are available for the class being predicted.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/m1frasca/COSNet_GitHub", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "cosnet", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:00:11Z", "name": "COSNet", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/COSNet.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
