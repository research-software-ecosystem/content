      "sc:description": "leveraging higher-order structures for clustering analysis in biological networks.\n\nMOTIVATION:Clustering analysis in a biological network is to group biological entities into functional modules, thus providing valuable insight into the understanding of complex biological systems. Existing clustering techniques make use of lower-order connectivity patterns at the level of individual biological entities and their connections, but few of them can take into account of higher-order connectivity patterns at the level of small network motifs. RESULTS:Here, we present a novel clustering framework, namely HiSCF, to identify functional modules based on the higher-order structure information available in a biological network. Taking advantage of higher-order Markov stochastic process, HiSCF is able to perform the clustering analysis by exploiting a variety of network motifs",
