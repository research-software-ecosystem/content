  "sc:description": "A single stop solution for analysing data from genetic screens. There are three steps to the analysis pipeline, each of which can also be run separately from the rest. First, images of plates with colonies are processed to give quantified colony sizes for the screen. Next, the colony sizes are normalised and filtered within plates, taking into account position effects and other confounding factors.",
