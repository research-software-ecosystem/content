description: 'IQ-TREE is a very efficient maximum likelihood phylogenetic software
  with following key features among others: . * A novel fast and effective stochastic
  algorithm to estimate maximum likelihood trees. IQ-TREE outperforms both RAxML and
  PhyML in terms of likelihood while requiring similar amount of computing time (see
  Nguyen et al., 2015) * An ultrafast bootstrap approximation to assess branch supports
  (see Minh et al., 2013). * A wide range of substitution models for binary, DNA,
  protein, codon, and morphological alignments. * Ultrafast model selection for all
  data types, 10 to 100 times faster than jModelTest and ProtTest. * Finding best
  partition scheme like PartitionFinder. * Partitioned models with mixed data types
  for phylogenomic (multi- gene) alignments, allowing for separate, proportional,
  or joint branch lengths among genes. * Supporting the phylogenetic likelihod library
  (PLL) (see Flouri et al., 2014)'
