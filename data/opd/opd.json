    "description": "Data Mining of the Reviews from Online Private Doctors.\n\nBackground: User-generated content shared in the online health communities (OHCs) is becoming a valuable resource for researchers to understand patients' decision-making behaviors in the management of their health. Many studies have focused on how to obtain useful information from online reviews in OHCs. Introduction: This study focuses on a telemedicine service called Online Private Doctor (OPD), which is offered by a leading Chinese physician review website (PRW). OPD reviews have not received much attention. By data mining the reviews, our goal is to determine what patients are talking about when they use the OPD service and whether they are satisfied with the service or not. Materials and Methods: We used a Python web crawler to collect 41,029 reviews and 84,510 short reviews (labels) of all 5,645 physicians who offered the OPD service on a PRW (haodf.com) in China.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
