These are identified by searching protein sequences for specific domain profiles that implicate a protein in signal transduction. It contains a host of new features and improvements including the following: draft genomes; extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor protein identification; enhanced classification of signaling proteins; among others.",
