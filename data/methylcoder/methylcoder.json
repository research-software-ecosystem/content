It provides the option to use either of two existing short-read aligners, each with different strengths. It accounts for soft-masked alignments and overlapping paired-end reads. MethylCoder outputs data in text and binary formats in addition to the nal alignment in SAM format, so that common high-throughput sequencing tools can be used on the resulting output. It is more exible than existing software and competitive in terms of speed and memory use. \u00a9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.
