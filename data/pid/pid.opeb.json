Created in a collaboration between the US National Cancer Institute and Nature Publishing Group, the database serves as a research tool for the cancer research community and others interested in cellular pathways, such as neuroscientists, developmental biologists and immunologists. PID offers a range of search features to facilitate pathway exploration. Users can browse the predefined set of pathways or create interaction network maps centered on a single molecule or cellular process of interest. In addition, the batch query tool allows users to upload long list(s) of molecules, such as those derived from microarray experiments, and either overlay these molecules onto predefined pathways or visualize the complete molecular connectivity map. Users can also download molecule lists, citation lists and complete database content in extensible markup language (XML) and Biological Pathways Exchange (BioPAX) Level 2 format. The database is updated with new pathway content every month and supplemented by specially commissioned articles on the practical uses of other relevant online tools. © 2008 The Author(s).","authors":["Schaefer C.F.","Anthony K.","Krupa S.","Buchoff J.","Day M.","Hannay T.","Buetow K.H."],"cit_count":752,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkn653","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"PID: The pathway interaction database","type":"Primary","year":"2009-01-09"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pid","biotoolsID":"pid","description":"Biomolecular interactions and cellular processes assembled into human signaling pathways.","homepage":"http://pid.nci.nih.gov/","name":"Pathway Interaction Database (PID)"}}
