Ubiquitination is also named \"lysine ubiquitination\" because it occurs when an ubiquitin is covalently attached to lysine (K) residues of targeting proteins. Given an uncharacterized protein sequence that contains many lysine residues, which one of them is the ubiquitination site, and which one is of non-ubiquitination site? With the avalanche of protein sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired for both basic research and drug development to develop an automated method for rapidly and accurately annotating the ubiquitination sites in proteins. In view of this, a new predictor called \"iUbiq-Lys\" was developed based on the evolutionary information, gray system model, as well as the general form of pseudo-amino acid composition. It was demonstrated via the rigorous cross-validations that the new predictor remarkably outperformed all its counterparts. As a web-server, iUbiq-Lys is accessible to the public at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iUbiq-Lys. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, we have further provided a protocol of step-by-step guide, by which users can easily get their desired results without the need to follow the complicated mathematics that were presented in this paper just for the integrity of its development process.","authors":["Qiu W.-R.","Xiao X.","Lin W.-Z.","Chou K.-C."],"cit_count":94,"journal":"Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics","pmid":"25248923","title":"IUbiq-Lys: Prediction of lysine ubiquitination sites in proteins by extracting sequence evolution information via a gray system model","year":"2015-08-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:iubiq-lys","biotoolsID":"iubiq-lys","description":"This web-server is a web server that could predict ubiquitination sites in proteins.
