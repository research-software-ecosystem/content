Results: Adjacent and alternate position residue pairs in hexapeptides show distinct preferences for occurrence in amyloid fibrils and amorphous \u03b2-aggregates. These observations were converted into energy potentials that were, in turn, machine learned. The resulting tool, called Generalized Aggregation Proneness (GAP), could successfully distinguish between amyloid fibril-forming and amorphous \u03b2-aggregating hexapeptides with almost 100 percent accuracies in validation tests performed using non-redundant datasets. Conclusion: Accuracies of the predictions made by GAP are significantly improved compared with other methods capable of predicting either general \u03b2-aggregation or amyloid fibril-forming APRs. This work demonstrates that amino acid side chains play important roles in determining the morphological fate of \u03b2-mediated aggregates formed by short peptides. \u00a9 2014 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 21, "authors": [{"name": "Thangakani A.M."}, {"name": "Kumar S."}, {"name": "Nagarajan R."}, {"name": "Velmurugan D."}, {"name": "Gromiha M.M."}], "date": "2014-07-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gromiha@iitm.ac.in"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gap", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/GAP/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Distinguish between amyloid fibril-forming and amorphous \u00df-aggregating hexapeptides with almost 100 percent accuracies in validation tests performed using non-redundant datasets.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/gap-distinguishing-between-amyloid-fibril-forming-and-amorphous-\u00df-aggregating-aggregation-prone-regions.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "gap", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:43:57Z", "name": "GAP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/GAP/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
