The next challenge is to automatically map them to the reference genome for further analysis and functional annotation. We have developed a tool that can be used to map important genomic features to the latest version of the human genome and also to annotate new features. These genomic features could be of many different source types, including miRNAs, microarray primers or probes, Chip-on-Chip data, CpG islands and SNPs to name a few. A standalone version and web interface for the tool can be accessed through: http://populationhealth.qimr.edu.au/cgi-bin/webFOG/index.cgi.
