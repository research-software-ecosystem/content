    "description": "Designed to simplify and expedite the process of haplotype analysis by providing a common interface to several tasks relating to such analyses. Haploview currently supports the following functionalities: LD and haplotype analysis, estimation of haplotype frequencies, single SNP and haplotype tests, permutation teststing and visualization and plotting of PLINK whole genome association results.",

The characterization of these patterns, particularly in the context of medical genetic association studies, is becoming a routine research activity. Haploview is a software package that provides computation of linkage disequilibrium statistics and population haplotype patterns from primary genotype data in a visually appealing and interactive interface. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
