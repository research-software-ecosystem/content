Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: With the rapid advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies and the continuing decline in the associated costs, high-throughput experiments can be performed to investigate the regulatory role of thousands of oligonucleotide sequences simultaneously. Nevertheless, designing high-throughput reporter assay experiments such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) and similar methods remains challenging. Results: We introduce MPRAnator, a set of tools that facilitate rapid design of MPRA experiments. With MPRA Motif design, a set of variables provides fine control of how motifs are placed into sequences, thereby allowing the investigation of the rules that govern transcription factor (TF) occupancy. MPRA single-nucleotide polymorphism design can be used to systematically examine the functional effects of single or combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms at regulatory sequences. Finally, the Transmutation tool allows for the design of negative controls by permitting scrambling, reversing, complementing or introducing multiple random mutations in the input sequences or motifs.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Georgakopoulos-Soares I."}, {"name": "Jain N."}, {"name": "Gray J.M."}, {"name": "Hemberg M."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ilias Georgakopoulos-Soares", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "igs@sanger.ac.uk"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Martin Hemberg", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mh26@sanger.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:MPRAnator", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/mpranator", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-08T08:58:23Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Web-based tool for the design of massively parallel reporter assay experiments.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["JavaScript", "Perl", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/hemberg-lab/MPRAnator/", "note": null, "type": "Repository"}, {"url": "https://github.com/hemberg-lab/MPRAnator/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}, {"url": "https://www.genomegeek.com/", "note": "MPRAnator is also available here", "type": "Other"}], "biotoolsID": "MPRAnator", "additionDate": "2019-07-08T08:58:23Z", "name": "MPRAnator", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.genomegeek.com/MPRA/documentation/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
