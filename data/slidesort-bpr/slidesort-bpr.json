The detection of rearrangement is typically done by using short reads generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and combining the reads with knowledge of a reference genome. Because structural variations and genomes differ from one person to another, intermediate comparison via a reference genome may lead to loss of information.Results: In this article, we propose a reference-free method for detecting clusters of breakpoints from the chromosomal rearrangements. This is done by directly comparing a set of NGS normal reads with another set that may be rearranged. Our method SlideSort-BPR (breakpoint reads) is based on a fast algorithm for all-against-all comparisons of short reads and theoretical analyses of the number of neighboring reads. When applied to a dataset with a sequencing depth of 100\u00d7, it finds \u223c88% of the breakpoints correctly with no false-positive reads. Moreover, evaluation on a real prostate cancer dataset shows that the proposed method predicts more fusion transcripts correctly than previous approaches, and yet produces fewer false-positive reads. To our knowledge, this is the first method to detect breakpoint reads without using a reference genome.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Wijaya E."}, {"name": "Shimizu K."}, {"name": "Asai K."}, {"name": "Hamada M."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://github.com/ewijaya", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:slidesort-bpr", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/ewijaya/slidesort-bpr", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2451"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool is based on a fast algorithm for all-against-all comparisons of short reads and theoretical analyses of the number of neighboring reads.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/slidesort-bpr-v2-finding-differences-between-multiple-short-read-datasets-without-reference-genome.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "slidesort-bpr", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:59:12Z", "name": "SlideSort-BPR", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/ewijaya/slidesort-bpr", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
