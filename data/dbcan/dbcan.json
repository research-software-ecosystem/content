We have developed a web resource, dbCAN (http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/dbCAN/annotate.php), to provide a capability for automated CAZyme signature domain-based annotation for any given protein data set (e.g. proteins from a newly sequenced genome) submitted to our server. To accomplish this, we have explicitly defined a signature domain for every CAZyme family, derived based on the CDD (conserved domain database) search and literature curation. We have also constructed a hidden Markov model to represent the signature domain of each CAZyme family. These CAZyme family-specific HMMs are our key contribution and the foundation for the automated CAZyme annotation. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 551, "authors": [{"name": "Yin Y."}, {"name": "Mao X."}, {"name": "Yang J."}, {"name": "Chen X."}, {"name": "Mao F."}, {"name": "Xu Y."}], "date": "2012-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ying Xu", "url": "http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/~xyn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "xyn@bmb.uga.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dbcan", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://csbl.bmb.uga.edu/dbCAN/annotate.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0226"}, {"term": "Genome annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0362"}, {"term": "Protein domain recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0246"}, {"term": "Protein feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3092"}, {"term": "Protein fold recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "dbCAN provides automated carbohydrate-active enzyme signature domain-based annotation for a set of proteins.
