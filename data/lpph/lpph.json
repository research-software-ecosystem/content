In this paper, we solve the open problem, giving a practical, deterministic linear-time algorithm based on a simple data structure and simple operations on it. The method is straightforward to program and has been fully implemented. Simulations show that it is much faster in practice than prior nonlinear methods. The value of a linear-time solution to the PPH problem is partly conceptual and partly for use in the inner loop of algorithms for more complex problems, where the PPH problem must be solved repeatedly. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "citationCount": 33, "authors": [{"name": "Ding Z."}, {"name": "Filkov V."}, {"name": "Gusfield D."}], "date": "2006-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dan Gusfield", "url": "http://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gusfield@cs.ucdavis.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:lpph", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://csiflabs.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/lpph.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Haplotype mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0487"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Linear-time program for inferring haplotypes from genotypes to determine if there are resulting haplotypes that fit a tree model.In more population genetic terms, LPPH determines whether a set of SNP genotypes can be explained by haplotype pairs that could have evolved on a coalescent under the no-recombination, infinite sites model.
