We systematically analyzed sources of noise in the Illumina Genome Analyzer that contribute to these high error rates and developed a base caller, Alta-Cyclic, that uses machine learning to compensate for noise factors. Alta-Cyclic substantially improved the number of accurate reads for sequencing runs up to 78 bases and reduced systematic biases, facilitating confident identification of sequence variants.","authors":["Erlich Y.","Mitra P.P.","delaBastide M.","McCombie W.R.","Hannon G.J."],"cit_count":102,"journal":"Nature Methods","pmid":"18604217","title":"Alta-Cyclic: A self-optimizing base caller for next-generation sequencing","year":"2008-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:alta-cyclic","biotoolsID":"alta-cyclic","description":"Alta-Cyclic is a Illumina Genome-Analyzer (Solexa) base caller.","homepage":"http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/Alta-Cyclic/main.html","name":"Alta-Cyclic"}}
