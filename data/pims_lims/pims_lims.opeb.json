Most of these trials are carried out in 96-well (or higher density) plates and managing them is a significant information management challenge. We describe xtalPiMS, a web-based application for the management and monitoring of crystallization trials. xtalPiMS has a user-interface layer based on the standards of the Protein Information Management System (PiMS) and a database layer which links the crystallization trial images to the meta-data associated with a particular crystallization trial. The user interface has been optimized for the efficient monitoring of high-throughput environments with three different automated imagers and work to support a fourth imager is in progress, but it can even be of use without robotics. The database can either be a PiMS database or a legacy database for which a suitable mapping layer has been developed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","authors":["Daniel E.","Lin B.","Diprose J.M.","Griffiths S.L.","Morris C.","Berry I.M.","Owens R.J.","Blake R.","Wilson K.S.","Stuart D.I.","Esnouf R.M."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1016/j.jsb.2011.05.008","journal":"Journal of Structural Biology","title":"XtalPiMS: A PiMS-based web application for the management and monitoring of crystallization trials","type":"Primary","year":"2011-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pims_lims","biotoolsID":"pims_lims","description":"Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) to support the unpredictable workflows of Molecular biology and Protein production labs of all sizes.","homepage":"https://www.limswiki.org/index.php/PiMS","name":"PiMS LIMS","version":["1"]}}
