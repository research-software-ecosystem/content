    "description": "RUBIC detects recurrent copy number aberrations using copy number breaks, rather than recurrently amplified or deleted regions. This allows for a vastly simplified approach as recursive peak splitting procedures and repeated re-estimation of the background model are avoided. Furthermore, the false discovery rate is controlled on the level of called regions, rather than at the probe level.",
