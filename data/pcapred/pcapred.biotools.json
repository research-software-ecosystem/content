For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Protein-carbohydrate interactions play a major role in several cellular and biological processes. Elucidating the factors influencing the binding affinity of protein-carbohydrate complexes and predicting their free energy of binding provide deep insights for understanding the recognition mechanism. In this work, we have collected the experimental binding affinity data for a set of 389 protein-carbohydrate complexes and derived several structure-based features such as contact potentials, interaction energy, number of binding residues and contacts between different types of atoms. Our analysis on the relationship between binding affinity and structural features revealed that the important factors depend on the type of the complex based on number of carbohydrate and protein chains. Specifically, binding site residues, accessible surface area, interactions between various atoms and energy contributions are important to understand the binding affinity. Further, we have developed multiple regression equations for predicting the binding affinity of protein-carbohydrate complexes belonging to six categories of protein-carbohydrate complexes. Our method showed an average correlation and mean absolute error of 0.731 and 1.149 kcal/mol, respectively, between experimental and predicted binding affinities on a jackknife test. We have developed a web server PCA-Pred, Protein-Carbohydrate Affinity Predictor, for predicting the binding affinity of protein-carbohydrate complexes.
