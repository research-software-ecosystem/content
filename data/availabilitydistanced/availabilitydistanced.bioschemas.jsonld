  "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Distanced' | Accurate estimation of microbial sequence diversity with Distanced | Distanced is a bioinformatics tool that estimates diversity of microbes. Specifically, it estimates the diversity of ribosomal DNA sequences within microbial communities. Estimating diversity of microbes is a challenge because errors in sequence create false sequences and inflate diversity. Distanced overcomes this problem by correcting values of mean pairwise distance, a measure of within-sample diversity, for the expected increase after sequencing | Distanced requires a set a DNA sequence reads in fastq format. A set of reference sequences in fasta format is optional. If reference sequences are provided, Distanced will report the actual diversity of the DNA sequences, providing a check on accuracy",
