                "abstract": "The increasing number of biomedical and translational applications in mass spectrometry-based proteomics poses new analytical challenges and raises the need for automated quality control systems. Despite previous efforts to set standard file formats, data processing workflows and key evaluation parameters for quality control, automated quality control systems are not yet widespread among proteomics laboratories, which limits the acquisition of high-quality results, inter-laboratory comparisons and the assessment of variability of instrumental platforms. Here we present QCloud, a cloud-based system to support proteomics laboratories in daily quality assessment using a user-friendly interface, easy setup, automated data processing and archiving, and unbiased instrument evaluation. QCloud supports the most common targeted and untargeted proteomics workflows, it accepts data formats from different vendors and it enables the annotation of acquired data and reporting incidences. A complete version of the QCloud system has successfully been developed and it is now open to the proteomics community (http://qcloud.crg.eu).

Since its release, QCloud has facilitated automated quality control for proteomics experiments in many laboratories. QCloud provides a quick and effortless evaluation of instrument performance that helps to overcome many analytical challenges derived from clinical and translational research. Here we present an improved version of the system, QCloud2. This new version includes enhancements in the scalability and reproducibility of the quality-control pipelines, and it features an improved front end for data visualization, user management, and chart annotation. The QCloud2 system also includes programmatic access and a standalone local version.",
