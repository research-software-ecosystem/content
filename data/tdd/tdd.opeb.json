Agile process models advocate Test Driven Development (TDD) as one among their key practices for reducing costs and improving code quality. In this paper we comparatively analyze GitHub repositories that adopt TDD against repositories that do not, in order to determine how TDD affects a number of variables related to productivity and developer satisfaction, two aspects that should be considered in a cost-benefit analysis of the paradigm. In this study, we searched through GitHub and found that a relatively small subset of Java-based repositories can be seen to adopt TDD, and an even smaller subset can be confidently identified as rigorously adhering to TDD.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'same-size', 'commits', 'sentiment', 'cost-benefit'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.1920V3","name":"TDD"}}
