    "description": "Systematic Establishment of Robustness and Standards in Patient-Derived Xenograft Experiments and Analysis.\n\nPatient Derived Xenograft Search Form.\n\nMTB has been designed to aid researchers in such areas as choosing experimental models, reviewing patterns of mutations in specific cancers, and identifying genes that are commonly mutated across a spectrum of cancers.\n\nPatient Derived Xenograft (PDX) models for cancer research are created by the implantation of human cells and tumor tissue into immune compromised mouse hosts. PDX models provide a platform for in vivo cancer biology studies and pre-clinical cancer drug efficacy testing. The current state of the art mouse host is the \"NOD-SCID-Gamma2\" (NSG) mouse. NSG mice lack mature T and B cells, have no functional natural killer cells, and are deficient in both innate immunity and cytokine signaling.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PDX', 'PDXNet', 'PDTC', 'tumor-in-mouse'",
