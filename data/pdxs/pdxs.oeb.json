PDX models provide a platform for in vivo cancer biology studies and pre-clinical cancer drug efficacy testing. The current state of the art mouse host is the \"NOD-SCID-Gamma2\" (NSG) mouse. NSG mice lack mature T and B cells, have no functional natural killer cells, and are deficient in both innate immunity and cytokine signaling.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PDX', 'PDXNet', 'PDTC', 'tumor-in-mouse'",
