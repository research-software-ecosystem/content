Due to their often aneuploid nature and admixed normal tissue, heterozygous variants found in primary cancers are often subtle and difficult to detect. To address these issues, we have developed a mutation detection algorithm, AutoCSA, specifically optimized for the high throughput screening of cancer samples. © 2007 The Author(s).","authors":["Dicks E.","Teague J.W.","Stephens P.","Raine K.","Yates A.","Mattocks C.","Tarpey P.","Butler A.","Menzies A.","Richardson D.","Jenkinson A.","Davies H.","Edkins S.","Forbes S.","Gray K.","Greenman C.","Shepherd R.","Stratton M.R.","Futreal P.A.","Wooster R."],"cit_count":13,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btm152","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"AutoCSA, an algorithm for high throughput DNA sequence variant detection in cancer genomes","type":"Primary","year":"2007-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:autocsa","biotoolsID":"autocsa","description":"AutoCSA (Automatic Comparative Sequence Analysis) is a mutation detection program designed to detect small mutations (1-50 bases) in sequence traces.
