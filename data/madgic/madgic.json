Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Identifying and prioritizing somatic mutations is an important and challenging area of cancer research that can provide new insights into gene function as well as new targets for drug development. Most methods for prioritizing mutations rely primarily on frequency-based criteria, where a gene is identified as having a driver mutation if it is altered in significantly more samples than expected according to a background model. Although useful, frequency-based methods are limited in that all mutations are treated equally. It is well known, however, that some mutations have no functional consequence, while others may have a major deleterious impact. The spatial pattern of mutations within a gene provides further insight into their functional consequence. Properly accounting for these factors improves both the power and accuracy of inference. Also important is an accurate background model. Results: Here, we develop a Model-based Approach for identifying Driver Genes in Cancer (termed MADGiC) that incorporates both frequency and functional impact criteria and accommodates a number of factors to improve the background model. Simulation studies demonstrate advantages of the approach, including a substantial increase in power over competing methods. Further advantages are illustrated in an analysis of ovarian and lung cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Korthauer K.D."}, {"name": "Kendziorski C."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Keegan Korthauer", "url": "http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kdkorthauer@wisc.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:madgic", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/MADGiC/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Statistical inference", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3658"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This R package fits an empirical Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain posterior probabilities that each gene is a driver.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/madgic-0-2-a-model-based-approach-for-identifying-driver-genes-in-cancer.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "madgic", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:48:40Z", "name": "MADGiC", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kendzior/MADGiC/MADGiC-manual_0.2.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
