    "description": "Modular within and between score for drug response prediction in cancer cell lines.\n\nDrug response prediction in cancer cell lines is vital to discover new anticancer drugs. However, it's still a challenging task to accurately predict drug responses in cancer cell lines. In this study, we presented a novel computational approach, named as MSDRP (modular within and between score for drug response prediction), to predict drug responses in cell lines. The method is based on a constructed heterogeneous drug-cell line network with multiple information. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, MSDRP acquired better predictive performance, and identified potential associations between drugs and cell lines, which have been confirmed by the published literature. The source code of MSDRP is freely available at https: github.com shimingwang1994 MSDRP.git",
