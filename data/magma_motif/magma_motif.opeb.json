We have developed Magma (Multiple Aligner of Genomic Multiple Alignments), a software tool for multiple species, multiple gene motif discovery. Magma identifies putative regulatory sites that are conserved across multiple species and occur near multiple genes throughout a reference genome. Magma takes as input multiple alignments that can include gaps. It uses efficient clustering methods that make it about 70 times faster than PhyloNet, a previous program for this task, with slightly greater sensitivity. We ran Magma on all non-coding DNA conserved between Caenorhabditis elegans and five additional species, about 70 Mbp in total, in <4 h. We obtained 2,309 motifs with lengths of 6-20 bp, each occurring at least 10 times throughout the genome, which collectively covered about 566 kbp of the genomes, approximately 0.8% of the input. Predicted sites occurred in all types of non-coding sequence but were especially enriched in the promoter regions. Comparisons to several experimental datasets show that Magma motifs correspond to a variety of known regulatory motifs. © 2012 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","authors":["Ihuegbu N.E.","Stormo G.D.","Buhler J."],"cit_count":5,"journal":"Journal of Computational Biology","pmid":"22300316","title":"Fast, sensitive discovery of conserved genome-wide motifs","year":"2012-02-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:magma_motif","biotoolsID":"magma_motif","description":"Fast, sensitive tool for whole regulome motif-finding in eukaryotic genomes","homepage":"http://stormo.wustl.edu/Magma/","name":"Magma"}}
