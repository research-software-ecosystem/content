Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Interactive Tree Of Life (http://itol.embl.de) is a web-based tool for the display, manipulation and annotation of phylogenetic trees. It is freely available and open to everyone. The current version was completely redesigned and rewritten, utilizing current web technologies for speedy and streamlined processing. Numerous new features were introduced and several new data types are now supported. Trees with up to 100,000 leaves can now be efficiently displayed. Full interactive control over precise positioning of various annotation features and an unlimited number of datasets allow the easy creation of complex tree visualizations. iTOL 3 is the first tool which supports direct visualization of the recently proposed phylogenetic placements format. Finally, iTOL's account system has been redesigned to simplify the management of trees in user-defined workspaces and projects, as it is heavily used and currently handles already more than 500,000 trees from more than 10,000 individual users.", "citationCount": 919, "authors": [{"name": "Letunic I."}, {"name": "Bork P."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "21470960", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Interactive Tree of Life v2: Online annotation and display of phylogenetic trees made easy", "abstract": "Interactive Tree Of Life (http://itol.embl.de) is a web-based tool for the display, manipulation and annotation of phylogenetic trees.
