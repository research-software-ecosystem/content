      "sc:description": "A Machine Vision Rodent Tracking Camera and Closed Loop Control System.\n\nRAT is a low-cost system to track and report mouse activity while they are contained in a simple arena. The system uses an OpenMV M7 microcontroller to acquire images of the arena and process them in real-time to report mouse centroid data to a text file. This data can be used as a measure of mouse movement (i.e speed and distance traveled) for various activity studies. This project is currently ongoing as we test and perfect the prototypes.",
