A large part of relevant information is buried in the literature or collected in various different databases. By hand-curated screenings of literature and databases, we retrieved experimentally validated data on 71 human RNA-binding splicing regulatory proteins and organized them into a database called 'SpliceAid-F' (http://www.caspur.it/SpliceAidF/). For each splicing factor (SF), the database reports its functional domains, its protein and chemical intera-ctors and its expression data. Furthermore, we collected experimentally validated RNA-SF interactions, including relevant information on the RNA-binding sites, such as the genes where these sites lie, their genomic coordinates, the splicing effects, the experimental procedures used, as well as the corresponding bibliographic references. We also collected information from experiments showing no RNA-SF binding, at least in the assayed conditions. In total, SpliceAid-F contains 4227 interactions, 2590 RNA-binding sites and 1141 'no-binding' sites, including information on cellular contexts and conditions where binding was tested. The data collected in SpliceAid-F can provide significant information to explain an observed splicing pattern as well as the effect of mutations in functional regulatory elements. © The Author(s) 2012.","authors":["Giulietti M.","Piva F.","D'Antonio M.","De Meo P.D.","Paoletti D.","Castrignano T.","D'Erchia A.M.","Picardi E.","Zambelli F.","Principato G.","Pavesi G.","Pesole G."],"cit_count":36,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gks997","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"SpliceAid-F: A database of human splicing factors and their RNA-binding sites","type":"Primary","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:spliceaid-f","biotoolsID":"spliceaid-f","description":"A database of human splicing factors and their binding sites.","homepage":"http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/SpliceAidF/","name":"SpliceAid-F"}}
