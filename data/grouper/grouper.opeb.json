Motivation: De novo transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq offers a promising means to study gene expression in non-model organisms. Yet, the difficulty of transcriptome assembly means that the contigs provided by the assembler often represent a fractured and incomplete view of the transcriptome, complicating downstream analysis. We introduce Grouper, a new method for clustering contigs from de novo assemblies that are likely to belong to the same transcripts and genes; these groups can subsequently be analyzed more robustly. When provided with access to the genome of a related organism, Grouper can transfer annotations to the de novo assembly, further improving the clustering. Results: On de novo assemblies from four different species, we show that Grouper is able to accurately cluster a larger number of contigs than the existing state-of-the-art method. TheGrouper pipeline is able to map greater than 10% more reads against the contigs, leading to accurate downstreamdifferential expression analyses. The labeling module, in the presence of a closely related annotated genome, can efficiently transfer annotations to the contigs and use this information to further improve clustering. Overall, Grouper provides a complete and efficient pipeline for processing de novo transcriptomic assemblies.","authors":["Malik L.","Almodaresi F.","Patro R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty378","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Grouper: Graph-based clustering and annotation for improved de novo transcriptome analysis","year":"2018-10-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:grouper","biotoolsID":"grouper","description":"Graph-based clustering and annotation for improved de novo transcriptome analysis.","homepage":"https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/grouper","name":"Grouper"}}
