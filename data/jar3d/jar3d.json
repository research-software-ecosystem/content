Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Many non-coding RNAs have been identified and may function by forming 2D and 3D structures. RNA hairpin and internal loops are often represented as unstructured on secondary structure diagrams, but RNA 3D structures show that most such loops are structured by non-Watson-Crick basepairs and base stacking. Moreover, different RNA sequences can form the same RNA 3D motif. JAR3D finds possible 3D geometries for hairpin and internal loops by matching loop sequences to motif groups from the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, by exact sequence match when possible, and by probabilistic scoring and edit distance for novel sequences. The scoring gauges the ability of the sequences to form the same pattern of interactions observed in 3D structures of the motif. The JAR3D webserver at http://rna.bgsu.edu/jar3d/ takes one or many sequences of a single loop as input, or else one or many sequences of longer RNAs with multiple loops. Each sequence is scored against all current motif groups. The output shows the ten best-matching motif groups. Users can align input sequences to each of the motif groups found by JAR3D. JAR3D will be updated with every release of the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, and so its performance is expected to improve over time.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Roll J."}, {"name": "Zirbel C.L."}, {"name": "Sweeney B."}, {"name": "Petrov A.I."}, {"name": "Leontis N."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "BGSU research", "url": "http://www.bgsu.edu/research/rna/contact-us.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:jar3d", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rna.bgsu.edu/jar3d", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA secondary structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2439"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Scores RNA hairpin and internal loop sequences against motif groups from the RNA 3D Motif Atlas, by exact sequence match for sequences already observed in 3D and by probabilistic scoring and edit distance for novel sequences.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java", "MATLAB", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/jar3d-predicting-rna-3d-motifs-in-sequences.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "jar3d", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:47:18Z", "name": "JAR3D", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.bgsu.edu/research/rna/help/tutorials.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
