Accurately ascertaining sequences in these regions with next generation sequencers is challenging, and requires a different set of analytical techniques than for reads originating from unique sequences. Complicating the matter are repetitive regions subject to programmed rearrangements, as is the case with the antigen-binding domains in the Immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) loci. Results: We developed a probability-based score and visualization method to aid in distinguishing true structural variants from alignment artifacts. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method in its ability to separate real structural variants from false positives generated with existing upstream analysis tools. We validated our approach using both target-capture and whole-genome experiments. Capture sequencing reads were generated from primary lymphoid tumors, cancer cell lines and an EBV-transformed lymphoblast cell line over the Ig and TCR loci. Whole-genome sequencing reads were from a lymphoblastoid cell-line. \u00a9 2014 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Halper-Stromberg E."}, {"name": "Steranka J."}, {"name": "Burns K.H."}, {"name": "Sabunciyan S."}, {"name": "Irizarry R.A."}], "date": "2014-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://github.com/Eitan177", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:targetseqview", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/Eitan177/targetSeqView", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Structural variation detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3228"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A probability-based score and visualization method to aid in distinguishing true structural variants from alignment artifacts.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/targetseqview-visualize-next-generation-sequencing-reads-over-putative-structural-variants.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "targetseqview", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:08:32Z", "name": "targetSeqView", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/Eitan177/targetSeqView", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
