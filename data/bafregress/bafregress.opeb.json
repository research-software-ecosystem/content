Although methods exist to detect and filter out cross-species contamination, few methods to detect within-species sample contamination are available. In this paper, we describe methods to identify within-species DNA sample contamination based on (1) a combination of sequencing reads and array-based genotype data, (2) sequence reads alone, and (3) array-based genotype data alone. Analysis of sequencing reads allows contamination detection after sequence data is generated but prior to variant calling; analysis of array-based genotype data allows contamination detection prior to generation of costly sequence data. Through a combination of analysis of in silico and experimentally contaminated samples, we show that our methods can reliably detect and estimate levels of contamination as low as 1%. We evaluate the impact of DNA contamination on genotype accuracy and propose effective strategies to screen for and prevent DNA contamination in sequencing studies. © 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.","authors":["Jun G.","Flickinger M.","Hetrick K.N.","Romm J.M.","Doheny K.F.","Abecasis G.R.","Boehnke M.","Kang H.M."],"cit_count":102,"journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","pmid":"23103226","title":"Detecting and estimating contamination of human DNA samples in sequencing and array-based genotype data","year":"2012-11-02"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:bafregress","biotoolsID":"bafregress","description":"Software that detects and estimates sample contamination using B allele frequency data from Illumina genotyping arrays using a regression model.","homepage":"http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAFRegress","name":"BAFRegress"}}
