This article is published online with Open Access by IOS Press and distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0).Cultural attitudes, linguistic variation, and historical pathology have led to a plethora of terms concerning gender, sex, and sexual orientation that have caused confusion and uneasiness among both lay people and relevant professionals. For members of the LGBTQIA+ community, these negative reactions are compounded by identities which have historically and contemporarily been mistreated by medical professionals. In an effort to provide a reliable resource for patients and clinicians, we have created the Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation (GSSO) ontology, which currently includes over 4,000 entities from multiple disciplines. The GSSO is a manually curated resource utilizing related glossaries from biology, medicine, psychology, sociology, and gender studies. With links to over 20 other ontology resources such as SNOMED-CT and MedDRA, the GSSO aims for accessibility and interoperability with existing systems. It is also open-source and features an easy-to-use web interface (https://github.com/Superraptor/GSSO). Future work involves multiple language support efforts and empirical evaluation.","authors":["Kronk C.","Tran G.Q.","Wu D.T.Y."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.3233/SHTI190213","journal":"Studies in Health Technology and Informatics","pmid":"31437915","title":"Creating a queer ontology: The gender, sex, and sexual orientation (GSSO) ontology","year":"2019-08-21"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:GSSO","biotoolsID":"GSSO","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GSSO ontology', 'Gender Sex Sexual Orientation' | The Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation (GSSO) Ontology | GSSO is the Gender, Sex, and Sex Orientation ontology, including terms related to gender identity and expression, sexual and romantic identity and orientation, and sexual and reproductive behavior | Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation","homepage":"https://github.com/Superraptor/GSSO","name":"GSSO"}}
