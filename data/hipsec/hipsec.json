    "description": "Hipsec is a tool for predicting high-level protein production in Aspergillus niger. The software predicts if gene overexpression of an extracellular protein will lead to successful high-level production in Aspergillus niger. The prediction is based on a protein\u2019s amino acid sequence. One or more protein sequences can be pasted into the the text area (fasta format) or uploaded as a fasta file.",

                "abstract": "Protein sequence features are explored in relation to the production of over-expressed extracellular proteins by fungi. Knowledge on features influencing protein production and secretion could be employed to improve enzyme production levels in industrial bioprocesses via protein engineering. A large set, over 600 homologous and nearly 2,000 heterologous fungal genes, were overexpressed in Aspergillus niger using a standardized expression cassette and scored for high versus no production. Subsequently, sequence-based machine learning techniques were applied for identifying relevant DNA and protein sequence features. The amino-acid composition of the protein sequence was found to be most predictive and interpretation revealed that, for both homologous and heterologous gene expression, the same features are important: tyrosine and asparagine composition was found to have a positive correlation with high-level production, whereas for unsuccessful production, contributions were found for methionine and lysine composition. The predictor is available online at http://bioinformatics.tudelft.nl/hipsec. Subsequent work aims at validating these findings by protein engineering as a method for increasing expression levels per gene copy. \u00a9 2012 van den Berg et al.",
