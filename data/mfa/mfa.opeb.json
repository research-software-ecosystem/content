Modeling bifurcations in single-cell transcriptomics data has become an increasingly popular field of research. Several methods have been proposed to infer bifurcation structure from such data, but all rely on heuristic non-probabilistic inference. Here we propose the first generative, fully probabilistic model for such inference based on a Bayesian hierarchical mixture of factor analyzers. Our model exhibits competitive performance on large datasets despite implementing full Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and its unique hierarchical prior structure enables automatic determination of genes driving the bifurcation process. We additionally propose an Empirical-Bayes like extension that deals with the high levels of zero-inflation in single-cell RNA-seq data and quantify when such models are useful. We apply or model to both real and simulated single-cell gene expression data and compare the results to existing pseudotime methods. Finally, we discuss both the merits and weaknesses of such a unified, probabilistic approach in the context practical bioinformatics analyses.","authors":["Campbell K.R.","Yau C."],"cit_count":8,"doi":"10.12688/wellcomeopenres.11087.1","journal":"Wellcome Open Research","title":"Probabilistic modeling of bifurcations in single-cell gene expression data using a Bayesian mixture of factor analyzers","type":"Primary","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mfa","biotoolsID":"mfa","description":"MFA models genomic bifurcations using a Bayesian hierarchical mixture of factor analysers.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mfa.html","name":"mfa","version":["1.2.0"]}}
