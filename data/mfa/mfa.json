Modeling bifurcations in single-cell transcriptomics data has become an increasingly popular field of research. Several methods have been proposed to infer bifurcation structure from such data, but all rely on heuristic non-probabilistic inference. Here we propose the first generative, fully probabilistic model for such inference based on a Bayesian hierarchical mixture of factor analyzers. Our model exhibits competitive performance on large datasets despite implementing full Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and its unique hierarchical prior structure enables automatic determination of genes driving the bifurcation process. We additionally propose an Empirical-Bayes like extension that deals with the high levels of zero-inflation in single-cell RNA-seq data and quantify when such models are useful. We apply or model to both real and simulated single-cell gene expression data and compare the results to existing pseudotime methods. Finally, we discuss both the merits and weaknesses of such a unified, probabilistic approach in the context practical bioinformatics analyses.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Campbell K.R."}, {"name": "Yau C."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Wellcome Open Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Kieran Campbell", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kieranrcampbell@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mfa", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mfa.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Data handling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "MFA models genomic bifurcations using a Bayesian hierarchical mixture of factor analysers.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/mfa/", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "mfa", "additionDate": "2018-07-21T18:43:23Z", "name": "mfa", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/mfa/man/mfa.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
