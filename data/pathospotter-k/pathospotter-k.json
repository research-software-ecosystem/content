PathoSpotter-K is the version that was developed to detect nephrological lesions in digital images of kidneys. Here, we present the results obtained using the first version of PathoSpotter-K, which uses classical image processing and pattern recognition methods to detect proliferative glomerular lesions with an accuracy of 88.3 \u00b1 3.6%. Such performance is only achieved by similar systems if they use images of cell in contexts that are much less complex than the glomerular structure. The results indicate that the approach can be applied to the development of systems designed to train pathology students and to assist pathologists in determining large-scale clinicopathological correlations in morphological research.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Barros G.O."}, {"name": "Navarro B."}, {"name": "Duarte A."}, {"name": "Dos-Santos W.L.C."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Scientific Reports"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "George Oliveira Barros", "url": "https://github.com/geogob", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pathospotter-k", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/geogob/PathoSpotter-K", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Image analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Computational tool for the automatic identification of glomerular lesions in histological images of kidneys.", "toolType": ["Script"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "pathospotter-k", "additionDate": "2018-07-07T13:45:27Z", "name": "PathoSpotter-K", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/geogob/PathoSpotter-K/blob/master/PathoSpotter-K%20Description", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
