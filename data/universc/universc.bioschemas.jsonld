      "sc:description": "UniverSC: Single-cell processing across technologies and a flexible cross-platform single-cell data processing pipeline.\n\nSingle-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to quantify RNA molecules in individual cells has become popular owing to the large amount of information one can obtain from each experiment. UniverSC is a universal single-cell processing tool that supports any UMI-based platform. Our command-line tool enables consistent and comprehensive integration, comparison, and evaluation across data generated from a wide range of platforms. Here we provide a guide to install and use this tool to process single-cell RNA-Seq data from FASTQ format.",
