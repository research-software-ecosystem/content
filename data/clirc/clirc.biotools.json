    "description": "Large-Scale Profiling of RBP-circRNA Interactions from Public CLIP-Seq Datasets.\n\nClirc: a user-friendly bioinformatics software to identify RBP-bound circRNAs through analysis of CLIP-Seq data.\n\nThe Clirc software is designed to identify RBP-bound circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data. The Clirc software internally calls the gsnap aligner for alignment of CLIP-Seq reads. The CLIP-Seq technology comprises of three variants: HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP, and iCLIP. The Clirc software works on all three versions of them. It can also work on any type of RNA-Seq data in general, although non-polyA selected RNA-Seq is preferred. The Clirc software is designed to search for known circRNAs in high-throughput sequencing data whose coordinates are provided by users. The users can collect these coordinates from previous publication or their own search using RNA-Seq data. This avoids the common problem of short sequncing reads in CLIP-Seq data. But this approach cannot identify novel circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Circular RNAs are a special type of RNA that has recently attracted a lot of research interest in studying its formation and function. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that bind circRNAs are important in these processes, but have been relatively less studied. CLIP-Seq technology has been invented and applied to profile RBP-RNA interactions on the genome-wide scale. While mRNAs are usually the focus of CLIP-Seq experiments, RBP-circRNA interactions could also be identified through specialized analysis of CLIP-Seq datasets. However, many technical difficulties are involved in this process, such as the usually short read length of CLIP-Seq reads. In this study, we created a pipeline called Clirc specialized for profiling circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data and analyzing the characteristics of RBP-circRNA interactions. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to investigate circRNAs and their binding partners through repurposing CLIP-Seq datasets, and we hope our work will become a valuable resource for future studies into the biogenesis and function of circRNAs.",
