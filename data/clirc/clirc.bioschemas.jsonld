      "sc:description": "Large-Scale Profiling of RBP-circRNA Interactions from Public CLIP-Seq Datasets.\n\nClirc: a user-friendly bioinformatics software to identify RBP-bound circRNAs through analysis of CLIP-Seq data.\n\nThe Clirc software is designed to identify RBP-bound circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data. The Clirc software internally calls the gsnap aligner for alignment of CLIP-Seq reads. The CLIP-Seq technology comprises of three variants: HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP, and iCLIP. The Clirc software works on all three versions of them. It can also work on any type of RNA-Seq data in general, although non-polyA selected RNA-Seq is preferred. The Clirc software is designed to search for known circRNAs in high-throughput sequencing data whose coordinates are provided by users. The users can collect these coordinates from previous publication or their own search using RNA-Seq data. This avoids the common problem of short sequncing reads in CLIP-Seq data. But this approach cannot identify novel circRNAs in CLIP-Seq data",
