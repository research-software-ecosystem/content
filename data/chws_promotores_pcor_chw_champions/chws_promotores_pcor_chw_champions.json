Main Questions: How the process of mobilization and engagement would be implemented at local state level. What would be project challenges, risks and barriers at each and across sites. What modifications would be made to the initial PCOR for CHWs training curriculum and toolkit based on local feedback from collaborators, in both English and Spanish. What would be lessons learned on mobilization, engagement of, and sustainability for CHW training organizations as partners in PCOR.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CHWs promotores PCOR CHW', 'promotores PCOR CHW Champions'",
