The collation of family members is performed using iterative PSI-BLAST runs. Examining positional conservation in close and distant family members enables a better selection of positions that may play a role in determining the protein's structure and function.","authors":["Friedberg I.","Margalit H."],"cit_count":1,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"12217925","title":"PeCoP: Automatic determination of persistently conserved positions in protein families","year":"2002-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pecop","biotoolsID":"pecop","description":"This server offers a new way to examine positional conservation in protein sequences.","homepage":"http://bioinformatics.org/pecop/","name":"PeCoP"}}
