      "sc:description": "An Ultrasensitive Chemical Isotope Labeling Assisted Pseudo-MRM Platform to Accelerate Exposomic Suspect Screening.\n\nExposome is the future of next-generation environmental health to establish the association between environmental exposure and diseases. However, due to low concentrations of exposure chemicals, exposome has been hampered by lacking an effective analytical platform to characterize its composition. In this study, by combining the benefit of chemical isotope labeling and pseudo-multiple reaction monitoring (CIL-pseudo-MRM), we have developed one highly sensitive and high-throughput platform (CIL-ExPMRM) by isotope labeling urinary exposure biomarkers. Dansyl chloride (DnsCl), <i>N< i>-methylphenylethylamine (MPEA), and their isotope-labeled forms were used to derivatize polar hydroxyl and carboxyl compounds, respectively\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MRM'",
