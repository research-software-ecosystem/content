    "description": "New insights on human essential genes based on integrated analysis and the construction of the HEGIAP web-based platform | Essential genes are those whose loss of function compromises organism viability or results in profound loss of fitness. Recent gene-editing technologies have provided new opportunities to characterize essential genes. Here, we present an integrated analysis that comprehensively and systematically elucidates the genetic and regulatory characteristics of human essential genes. First, we found that essential genes act as 'hubs' in protein-protein interaction networks, chromatin structure and epigenetic modification. Second, essential genes represent conserved biological processes across species, although gene essentiality changes differently among species. Third, essential genes are important for cell development due to their discriminate transcription activity in embryo development and oncogenesis",

Third, essential genes are important for cell development due to their discriminate transcription activity in embryo development and oncogenesis. In addition, we developed an interactive web server, the Human Essential Genes Interactive Analysis Platform (http://sysomics.com/HEGIAP/), which integrates abundant analytical tools to enable global, multidimensional interpretation of gene essentiality. Our study provides new insights that improve the understanding of human essential genes.",
