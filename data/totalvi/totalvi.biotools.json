    "description": "A Joint Model of RNA Expression and Surface Protein Abundance in Single Cells.\n\nCellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) combines unbiased single-cell transcriptome measurements with surface protein quantification comparable to flow cytometry, the gold standard for cell type identification. However, current analysis pipelines cannot address the two primary challenges of CITE-seq data: combining both modalities in a shared latent space that harnesses the power of the paired measurements, and handling the technical artifacts of the protein measurement, which is obscured by non-negligible background noise. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI), a fully probabilistic end-to-end framework for normalizing and analyzing CITE-seq data, based on a hierarchical Bayesian model.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CITE-seq'",
