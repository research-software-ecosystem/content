                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).IAMBEE is a web server designed for the Identification of Adaptive Mutations in Bacterial Evolution Experiments (IAMBEE). Input data consist of genotype information obtained from independently evolved clonal populations or strains that show the same adapted behavior (phenotype). To distinguish adaptive from passenger mutations, IAMBEE searches for neighborhoods in an organism-specific interaction network that are recurrently mutated in the adapted populations. This search for recurrently mutated network neighborhoods, as proxies for pathways is driven by additional information on the functional impact of the observed genetic changes and their dynamics during adaptive evolution. In addition, the search explicitly accounts for the differences in mutation rate between the independently evolved populations. Using this approach, IAMBEE allows exploiting parallel evolution to identify adaptive pathways. The web-server is freely available at http://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/iambee/ with no login requirement.",
