                "abstract": "IEEEIdentification of post-translational modifications (PTM) is significant in the study of computational proteomics, cell biology, pathogenesis, and drug development due to its role in many bio-molecular mechanisms. Computational methods for predicting multiple PTM at the same lysine residues, often referred to as K-PTM, is still evolving. This paper presents a novel computational tool, abbreviated as predML-Site, for predicting K-PTM, such as acetylation, crotonylation, methylation, succinylation from an uncategorized peptide sample involving single, multiple, or no modification. For informative feature representation, multiple sequence encoding schemes, such as the sequence-coupling, binary encoding, k-spaced amino acid pairs, amino acid factor have been used with ANOVA and incremental feature selection. As a core predictor, a cost-sensitive SVM classifier has been adopted which effectively mitigates the effect of class-label imbalance in the dataset. predML-Site predicts multi-label PTM sites with 84.18% accuracy using the top 91 features. It has also achieved 85.34% aiming and 86.58% coverage rate which are much better than the existing state-of-the-art predictors on the same rigorous validation test. This performance indicates that predML-Site can be used as a supportive tool for further K-PTM study. For the convenience of the experimental scientists, predML-Site has been deployed as a user-friendly web-server at http://103.99.176.239/predML-Site.",
