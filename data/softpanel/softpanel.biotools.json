                "abstract": "\ufffd 2016 Wang et al.Background: Targeted next-generation sequencing is playing an increasingly important role in biological research and clinical diagnosis by allowing researchers to sequence high priority genes at much higher depths and at a fraction of the cost of whole genome or exome sequencing. However, in designing the panel of genes to be sequenced, investigators need to consider the tradeoffbetween the better sensitivity of a broad panel and the higher specificity of a potentially more relevant panel. Although tools to prioritize candidate disease genes have been developed, the great majority of these require prior knowledge and a set of seed genes as input, which is only possible for diseases with a known genetic etiology. Results: To meet the demands of both researchers and clinicians, we have developed a user-friendly website called SoftPanel. This website is intended to serve users by allowing them to input a single disorder or a disorder group and generate a panel of genes predicted to underlie the disorder of interest. Various methods of retrieval including a keyword search, browsing of an arborized list of International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes or using disorder phenotypic similarities can be combined to define a group of disorders and the genes known to be associated with them. Moreover, SoftPanel enables users to expand or refine a gene list by utilizing several biological data resources. In addition to providing users with the facility to create a \"hard\" panel that contains an exact gene list for targeted sequencing, SoftPanel also enables generation of a \"soft\" panel of genes, which may be used to further filter a significantly altered set of genes identified through whole genome or whole exome sequencing. The service and data provided by SoftPanel can be accessed at http://www.isb.pku.edu.cn/SoftPanel/. A tutorial page is included for trying out sample data and interpreting results. Conclusion: SoftPanel provides a convenient and powerful tool for creating a targeted panel of potential disease genes while supporting different forms of input. SoftPanel may be utilized in both genomics research and personalized medicine.",
