The pseudo maximum likelihood estimator (PMLE) that we derive may be applied to species with either discrete or continuous generation times. For Wright's discrete-generation island model, the method provides an estimate of \u03b8 = 2Nm where N is the (haploid) population size on each island and m is the fraction of individuals replaced by immigrants in each generation. For a continuous-generation island model, the corresponding parameter \u03b8 is the ratio of the immigration rate \u2205 to the individual birth rate \u03bb. Monte Carlo simulations are used to compare the statistical properties of the PMLE with those of two alternative estimators of \u03b8 derived from Wright's F-statistics. The PMLE is shown to have greatest efficiency (least mean square error) in most cases for a wide range of sample sizes and parameter values. The PMLE is applied to estimate \u03b8 using mtDNA haplotypes and allozymes for subdivided populations of African elephants and Channel Island foxes.", "citationCount": 54, "authors": [{"name": "Rannala B."}, {"name": "Hartigan J.A."}], "date": "1996-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genetical Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "brannala@ualberta.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pmle", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.rannala.org/docs/pmle20.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Estimate the gene flow parameter\u00a0q\u00a0for a collection of two or more semi-isolated populations by (pseudo) maximum likelihood using either single or multi locus, haploid or diploid, genotype data.
