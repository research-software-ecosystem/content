Scientific decisions about which populations to sample to produce the HapMap, an international genetic vadation resource, have raised questions about the relationships between the social identities used to recruit participants and the biological findings of studies that will use the HapMap. The sometimes problematic implications of those complex relationships have led to questions about how to conduct genetic variation research that uses identified populations in an ethical way, including how to involve members of a population in evaluating the risks and benefits posed for everyone who shares that identity. The ways in which these issues are linked is increasingly drawing the scientific and ethical spheres of genomics research closer together.","authors":["Foster M.W."],"cit_count":181,"journal":"Nature Reviews Genetics","pmid":"15153999","title":"Integrating ethics and science in the International HapMap Project","year":"2004-06-01"},{"abstract":"The HapMap Web site at http://www.hapmap.org is the primary portal to genotype data produced as part of the International Haplotype Map Project. In phase I of the project, >1.1 million SNPs were genotyped in 270 individuals from four worldwide populations. The HapMap Web site provides researchers with a number of tools that allow them to analyze the data as well as download data for local analyses.

The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r 2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r 2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.","authors":["Frazer K.A.","Ballinger D.G.","Cox D.R.","Hinds D.A.","Stuve L.L.","Gibbs R.A.","Belmont J.W.","Boudreau A.","Hardenbol P.","Leal S.M.","Pasternak S.","Wheeler D.A.","Willis T.D.","Yu F.","Yang H.","Zeng C.","Gao Y.","Hu H.","Hu W.","Li C.","Lin W.","Liu S.","Pan H.","Tang X.","Wang J.","Wang W.","Yu J.","Zhang B.","Zhang Q.","Zhao H.","Zhao H.","Zhou J.","Gabriel S.B.","Barry R.","Blumenstiel B.","Camargo A.","Defelice M.","Faggart M.","Goyette M.","Gupta S.","Moore J.","Nguyen H.","Onofrio R.C.","Parkin M.","Roy J.","Stahl E.","Winchester E.","Ziaugra L.","Altshuler D.","Shen Y.","Yao Z.","Huang W.","Chu X.","He Y.","Jin L.","Liu Y.","Shen Y.","Sun W.","Wang H.","Wang Y.","Wang Y.","Xiong X.","Xu L.","Waye M.M.Y.","Tsui S.K.W.","Xue H.","Wong J.T.-F.","Galver L.M.","Fan J.-B.","Gunderson K.","Murray S.S.","Oliphant A.R.","Chee M.S.","Montpetit A.","Chagnon F.","Ferretti V.","Leboeuf M.","Olivier J.-F.","Phillips M.S.","Roumy S.","Sallee C.","Verner A.","Hudson T.J.","Kwok P.-Y.","Cai D.","Koboldt D.C.","Miller R.D.","Pawlikowska L.","Taillon-Miller P.","Xiao M.","Tsui L.-C.","Mak W.","You Q.S.","Tam P.K.H.","Nakamura Y.","Kawaguchi T.","Kitamoto T.","Morizono T.","Nagashima A.","Ohnishi Y.","Sekine A.","Tanaka T.","Tsunoda T.","Deloukas P.","Bird C.P.","Delgado M.","Dermitzakis E.T.","Gwilliam R.","Hunt S.","Morrison J.","Powell D.","Stranger B.E.","Whittaker P.","Bentley D.R.","Daly M.J.","De Bakker P.I.W.","Barrett J.","Chretien Y.R.","Maller J.","McCarroll S.","Patterson N.","Pe'Er I.","Price A.","Purcell S.","Richter D.J.","Sabeti P.","Saxena R.","Schaffner S.F.","Sham P.C.","Varilly P.","Stein L.D.","Krishnan L.","Smith A.V.","Tello-Ruiz M.K.","Thorisson G.A.","Chakravarti A.","Chen P.E.","Cutler D.J.","Kashuk C.S.","Lin S.","Abecasis G.R.","Guan W.","Li Y.","Munro H.M.","Qin Z.S.","Thomas D.J.","McVean G.","Auton A.","Bottolo L.","Cardin N.","Eyheramendy S.","Freeman C.","Marchini J.","Myers S.","Spencer C.","Stephens M.","Donnelly P.","Cardon L.R.","Clarke G.","Evans D.M.","Morris A.P.","Weir B.S.","Johnson T.A.","Mullikin J.C.","Sherry S.T.","Feolo M.","Skol A.","Zhang H.","Matsuda I.","Fukushima Y.","MacEr D.R.","Suda E.","Rotimi C.N.","Adebamowo C.A.","Ajayi I.","Aniagwu T.","Marshall P.A.","Nkwodimmah C.","Royal C.D.M.","Leppert M.F.","Dixon M.","Peiffer A.","Qiu R.","Kent A.","Kato K.","Niikawa N.","Adewole I.F.","Knoppers B.M.","Foster M.W.","Clayton E.W.","Watkin J.","Muzny D.","Nazareth L.","Sodergren E.","Weinstock G.M.","Yakub I.","Birren B.W.","Wilson R.K.","Fulton L.L.","Rogers J.","Burton J.","Carter N.P.","Clee C.M.","Griffiths M.","Jones M.C.","McLay K.","Plumb R.W.","Ross M.T.","Sims S.K.","Willey D.L.","Chen Z.","Han H.","Kang L.","Godbout M.","Wallenburg J.C.","L'Archeveque P.","Bellemare G.","Saeki K.","Wang H.","An D.","Fu H.","Li Q.","Wang Z.","Wang R.","Holden A.L.","Brooks L.D.","McEwen J.E.","Guyer M.S.","Wang V.O.","Peterson J.L.","Shi M.","Spiegel J.","Sung L.M.","Zacharia L.F.","Collins F.S.","Kennedy K.","Jamieson R.","Stewart J."],"cit_count":3130,"journal":"Nature","pmid":"17943122","title":"A second generation human haplotype map of over 3.1 million SNPs","year":"2007-10-18"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:int_hapmap_project","biotoolsID":"int_hapmap_project","description":"Tool that will allow researchers to find genes and genetic variations that affect health and disease.","homepage":"http://www.genome.gov/10001688","name":"International HapMap Project"}}
