We have developed an automated pipeline for phylogenomic analysis (AMPHORA) that overcomes the existing bottlenecks limiting large-scale protein phylogenetic inference. We demonstrated its high throughput capabilities and high quality results by constructing a genome tree of 578 bacterial species and by assigning phylotypes to 18,607 protein markers identified in metagenomic data collected from the Sargasso Sea. © 2008 Wu and Eisen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Wu M.","Eisen J.A."],"cit_count":285,"doi":"10.1186/gb-2008-9-10-r151","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"A simple, fast, and accurate method of phylogenomic inference","type":"Primary","year":"2008-10-13"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:amphora","biotoolsID":"amphora","description":"Automated Phylogenomic Inference Pipeline for bacterial sequences.
