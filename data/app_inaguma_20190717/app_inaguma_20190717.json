    "description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'dialysis', 'all-cause', 'NRI', 'CV-related' | Prediction model for cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality in incident dialysis patients | Some variables including age, comorbidity of diabetes, and so on at dialysis initiation are associated with patient prognosis. Cardiovascular (CV) events are a major cause of death, and adequate models that predict prognosis in dialysis patients are warranted. Therefore, we created models using some variables at dialysis initiation. We used a database of 1,520 consecutive dialysis patients (median age, 70 years; 492 women [32.4%]) from a multicenter prospective cohort study. We established the primary endpoint as a composite of the incidence of first CV events or all-cause death. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to construct a model. We considered a complex and a simple model",
