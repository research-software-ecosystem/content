                "abstract": "Background: New techniques for determining relationships between biomolecules of all types - genes, proteins, noncoding DNA, metabolites and small molecules - are now making a substantial contribution to the widely discussed explosion of facts about the cell. The data generated by these techniques promote a picture of the cell as an interconnected information network, with molecular components linked with one another in topologies that can encode and represent many features of cellular function. This networked view of biology brings the potential for systematic understanding of living molecular systems. Results: We present VisANT, an application for integrating biomolecular interaction data into a cohesive, graphical interface. This software features a multi-tiered architecture for data flexibility, separating back-end modules for data retrieval from a front-end visualization and analysis package. VisANT is a freely available, open-source tool for researchers, and offers an online interface for a large range of published data sets on biomolecular interactions, including those entered by users. This system is integrated with standard databases for organized annotation, including GenBank, KEGG and SwissProt. VisANT is a Java-based, platform-independent tool suitable for a wide range of biological applications, including studies of pathways, gene regulation and systems biology. Conclusion: VisANT has been developed to provide interactive visual mining of biological interaction data sets. The new software provides a general tool for mining and visualizing such data in the context of sequence, pathway, structure, and associated annotations. Interaction and predicted association data can be combined, overlaid, manipulated and analyzed using a variety of built-in functions. \u00a9 2004 Hu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Visualization is a vital aid in integrating and interpreting such data. We describe emerging approaches for representing and visualizing systems data and for achieving semantic zooming, or changes in information density concordant with scale. A central challenge is to move beyond the display of a static network to visualizations of networks as a function of time, space and cell state, which capture the adaptability of the cell. We consider approaches for representing the role of protein complexes in the cell cycle, displaying modules of metabolism in a hierarchical format, integrating experimental interaction data with structured vocabularies such as Gene Ontology categories and representing conserved interactions among orthologous groups of genes. \u00a9 2007 Nature Publishing Group.",

Expression levels are represented either by color intensity or by nodes with an embedded expression profile. Multiple experiments can be navigated or animated. Known KEGG pathways can be enriched by querying either coexpressed components of known pathway members or proteins with known physical interactions. Predicted pathways for genes/proteins with unknown functions can be inferred from coexpression or physical interaction data. Pathways produced in VisANT can be saved as computer-readable XML format (VisML), graphic images or high-resolution Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Pathways in the format of VisML can be securely shared within an interested group or published online using a simple Web link.

                "abstract": "Despite its wide usage in biological databases and applications, the role of the gene ontology (GO) in network analysis is usually limited to functional annotation of genes or gene sets with auxiliary information on correlations ignored. Here, we report on new capabilities of VisANT-an integrative software platform for the visualization, mining, analysis and modeling of the biological networks-which extend the application of GO in network visualization, analysis and inference. The new VisANT functions can be classified into three categories. (i) Visualization: a new tree-based browser allows visualization of GO hierarchies. GO terms can be easily dropped into the network to group genes annotated under the term, thereby integrating the hierarchical ontology with the network. This facilitates multi-scale visualization and analysis. (ii) Flexible annotation schema: in addition to conventional methods for annotating network nodes with the most specific functional descriptions available, VisANT also provides functions to annotate genes at any customized level of abstraction. (iii) Finding over-represented GO terms and expression-enriched GO modules: two new algorithms have been implemented as VisANT plugins. One detects over-represented GO annotations in any given sub-network and the other finds the GO categories that are enriched in a specified phenotype or perturbed dataset. Both algorithms take account of network topology (i.e. correlations between genes based on various sources of evidence). VisANT is freely available at http://visant.bu.edu.",

With improved understanding of the mechanisms of complex diseases and drug actions through network analysis, novel drug methods (e.g., drug repositioning, multi-target drug and combination therapy) can be designed. More specifically, the new update includes (i) integrated search and navigation of disease and drug hierarchies; (ii) integrated disease-gene, therapy-drug and drug-target association to aid the network construction and filtering; (iii) annotation of genes/drugs using disease/therapy information; (iv) prediction of associated diseases/therapies for a given set of genes/drugs using enrichment analysis; (v) network transformation to support construction of versatile network of drugs, genes, diseases and therapies; (vi) enhanced user interface using docking windows to allow easy customization of node and edge properties with build-in legend node to distinguish different node type.
