This work introduces a method to tune a sequence-based generative model for molecular de novo design that through augmented episodic likelihood can learn to generate structures with certain specified desirable properties. We demonstrate how this model can execute a range of tasks such as generating analogues to a query structure and generating compounds predicted to be active against a biological target. As a proof of principle, the model is first trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example, the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor type 2, the model generates structures of which more than 95% are predicted to be active, including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].","authors":["Olivecrona M.","Blaschke T.","Engkvist O.","Chen H."],"cit_count":39,"doi":"10.1186/s13321-017-0235-x","journal":"Journal of Cheminformatics","title":"Molecular de-novo design through deep reinforcement learning","year":"2017-09-04"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:reinvent","biotoolsID":"reinvent","description":"Molecular De Novo design using Recurrent Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning.","homepage":"https://github.com/MarcusOlivecrona/REINVENT","name":"REINVENT"}}
