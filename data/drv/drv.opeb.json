The recognition process is also influenced by the physicochemical and conformational character of the target oligonucleotide motif. Although the role of these mechanisms in DNA-protein interactions is well-established, bioinformatical methods rarely address them directly, instead binding specificity is mostly assessed at nucleotide level. DNA Readout Viewer (DRV) aims to provide a novel DNA representation, facilitating in-depth view into these mechanisms by the concurrent visualisation of functional groups and a diverse collection of DNA descriptors.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:DRV', 'DNA Readout Viewer'","homepage":"https://drv.brc.hu","name":"DRV"}}
