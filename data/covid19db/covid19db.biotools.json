Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Many open access transcriptomic data of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were generated, they have great heterogeneity and are difficult to analyze. To utilize these invaluable data for better understanding of COVID-19, additional software should be developed. Especially for researchers without bioinformatic skills, a user-friendly platform is mandatory. We developed the COVID19db platform (http://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/covid19db & http://www.biomedical-web.com/covid19db) that provides 39 930 drug-target-pathway interactions and 95 COVID-19 related datasets, which include transcriptomes of 4127 human samples across 13 body sites associated with the exposure of 33 microbes and 33 drugs/agents. To facilitate data application, each dataset was standardized and annotated with rich clinical information. The platform further provides 14 different analytical applications to analyze various mechanisms underlying COVID-19. Moreover, the 14 applications enable researchers to customize grouping and setting for different analyses and allow them to perform analyses using their own data. Furthermore, a Drug Discovery tool is designed to identify potential drugs and targets at whole transcriptomic scale. For proof of concept, we used COVID19db and identified multiple potential drugs and targets for COVID-19. In summary, COVID19db provides user-friendly web interfaces to freely analyze, download data, and submit new data for further integration, it can accelerate the identification of effective strategies against COVID-19.",
