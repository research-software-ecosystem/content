However, there is no single widely-accepted standard pipeline for analyzing functional connectivity. The common procedure for designing functional connectivity based predictive models entails three main steps: parcellating the brain, estimating the interaction between defined parcels, and lastly, using these integrated associations between brain parcels as features fed to a classifier for predicting non-imaging variables e.g., behavioural traits, demographics, emotional measures, etc",
