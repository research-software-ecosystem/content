SeaView version 4 combines all the functions of the widely used programs SeaView (in its previous versions) and Phylo-win, and expands them by adding network access to sequence databases, alignment with arbitrary algorithm, maximum-likelihood tree building with PhyML, and display, printing, and copy-to-clipboard of rooted or unrooted, binary or multifurcating phylogenetic trees. In relation to the wide present offer of tools and algorithms for phylogenetic analyses, SeaView is especially useful for teaching and for occasional users of such software.
