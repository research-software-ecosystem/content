The samples of patients with a disease and healthy ones have been processed using an AmpliSeq RNA sequencing kit of a custom design, that include 290 amplicons, sequenced using an IonTorrent machine. The read count data show the sufficient coverage in most of the chosen amplicons, which results in a good separability between the disease patients and healthy donors. In addition, several amplicons allow for checking useful genomics variants (SNPs), whenever the coverage level permits. The paper presents a machinelearning classifier evaluation of the answer to the question of difference between the patients and healthy donors, based upon the AmpliSeq panel data. The outcome confirms the potential utility of similar RNA amplicon kits in the research and clinical practice to encode gene expression signatures of diseases and their phenotypes.",
