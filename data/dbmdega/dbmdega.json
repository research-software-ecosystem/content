    "description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GBA', 'PASCAL', 'Novel Gene-Based Analysis ASD GWAS', 'ASD-associated' | Insight Into the Biological Role of Associated Genes | Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by its significant social impact and high heritability. The latest meta-analysis of ASD GWAS (genome-wide association studies) has revealed the association of several SNPs that were replicated in additional sets of independent samples. However, summary statistics from GWAS can be used to perform a gene-based analysis (GBA). GBA allows to combine all genetic information across the gene to create a single statistic (p-value for each gene). Thus, PASCAL (Pathway scoring algorithm), a novel GBA tool, has been applied to the summary statistics from the latest meta-analysis of ASD. GBA approach (testing the gene as a unit) provides an advantage to perform an accurate insight into the biological ASD mechanisms",
