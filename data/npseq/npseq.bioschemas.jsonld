  "sc:description": "R package for the significance analysis of sequencing data.  The statistic used is exactly the same as that in SAM 4.0. The only difference is that our tool uses symmetric cutoffs, while SAM uses asymmetric cutoffs. Therefore, for some datasets, all significant genes obtained by SAM are either all up-regulated or all down-regulated, but npSeq almost always gives significant genes that include both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes.",
