  "sc:description": "MotifSampler tries to find over-represented motifs in the upstream region of a set of co-regulated genes. This motif finding algorithm uses Gibbs sampling to find the position probability matrix that represents the motif. In this implementation we focus on the use of higher-order background models to improve the robustness of the motif finding. At the moment the MotifSampler comes with background models for several organisms .",
