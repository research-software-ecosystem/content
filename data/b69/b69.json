    "description": "The Association of Enhanced Recovery Pathway and Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery.\n\nBACKGROUND:Acute kidney injury is associated with increased postoperative length of hospital stay and increases the risk of postoperative mortality. The association between the development of postoperative acute kidney injury and the implementation of an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol remains unclear. OBJECTIVE:This study aimed to examine the relationship between the implementation of an enhanced recovery pathway and the development of postoperative acute kidney injury.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'recovery', 'enhanced recovery', 'enhanced', 'postoperative acute kidney injury'",
