Sequences of proteins of unknown function can be annotated with a putative function by comparing them with proteins of known function. This form of annotation is typically performed with BLAST or similar software. Structural genomics is nowadays also bringing us three dimensional structures of proteins with unknown function. We present here software that can be used when sequence comparisons fail to determine the function of a protein with known structure but unknown function. The software, called 3D-Fun, is implemented as a server that runs at several European institutes and is freely available for everybody at all these sites. The 3D-Fun servers accept protein coordinates in the standard PDB format and compare them with all known protein structures by 3D structural superposition using the 3D-Hit software. If structural hits are found with proteins with known function, these are listed together with their function and some vital comparison statistics. This is conceptually very similar in 3D to what BLAST does in 1D. Additionally, the superposition results are displayed using interactive graphics facilities. Currently, the 3D-Fun system only predicts enzyme function but an expanded version with Gene Ontology predictions will be available soon. The server can be accessed at http://3dfun.bioinfo.pl/ or at http://3dfun.cmbi.ru.nl/.","authors":["von Grotthuss M.","Plewczynski D.","Vriend G.","Rychlewski L."],"cit_count":7,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"18515349","title":"3D-Fun: predicting enzyme function from structure.","year":"2008-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:3d-fun","biotoolsID":"3d-fun","description":"Software for predicting enzyme function from structure rather than sequence.
