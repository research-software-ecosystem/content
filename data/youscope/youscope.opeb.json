However, the implementation of complex protocols on modern, motorized microscopes often requires their reformulation into low-level machine language. This recoding is a time-consuming and error-prone task that often requires advanced programming skills. This unit describes how to use the high level, open-source microscope control platform YouScope to implement complex measurement protocols. Three protocols detail how to install and configure YouScope on a motorized microscope, how to use YouScope to quickly assess the quality of a sample, and how to set up imaging protocols for cells in a microplate. In addition to these protocols, descriptions are given for the use of various other tools YouScope provides to successfully accomplish various microscopy tasks. © 2012 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","authors":["Lang M.","Rudolf F.","Stelling J."],"cit_count":9,"journal":"Current Protocols in Molecular Biology","pmid":"22470060","title":"Use of youscope to implement systematic microscopy protocols","year":"2012-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:youscope","biotoolsID":"youscope","description":"Open-source microscope control software compatible with most present-day automized microscopes.
