However, the implementation of complex protocols on modern, motorized microscopes often requires their reformulation into low-level machine language. This recoding is a time-consuming and error-prone task that often requires advanced programming skills. This unit describes how to use the high level, open-source microscope control platform YouScope to implement complex measurement protocols. Three protocols detail how to install and configure YouScope on a motorized microscope, how to use YouScope to quickly assess the quality of a sample, and how to set up imaging protocols for cells in a microplate. In addition to these protocols, descriptions are given for the use of various other tools YouScope provides to successfully accomplish various microscopy tasks. \u00a9 2012 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Lang M."}, {"name": "Rudolf F."}, {"name": "Stelling J."}], "date": "2012-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Current Protocols in Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://langmo.github.io/youscope/contact.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:youscope", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.youscope.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Image analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Open-source microscope control software compatible with most present-day automized microscopes.
