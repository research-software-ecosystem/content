Among others, pure parsimony provides a viable modeling approach for haplotype inference and provides a simple optimization criterion. Alternative approaches have been proposed for haplotype inference by pure parsimony (HIPP), including branch and bound, integer programming and, more recently, propositional satisfiability and pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO). Among these, the currently best performing HIPP approach is based on PBO. This paper proposes a number of effective improvements to PBO-based HIPP, including the use of lower bounding and pruning techniques effective with other approaches. The new PBO-based HIPP approach reduces by 50% the number of instances that remain unsolvable by HIPP based approaches. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","authors":["Graca A.","Marques-Silva J.","Lynce I.","Oliveira A.L."],"cit_count":9,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-540-68155-7_28","journal":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","title":"Efficient haplotype inference with combined CP and or techniques","type":"Primary","year":"2008-06-09"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rpoly","biotoolsID":"rpoly","description":"Infer haplotypes from genotype data (by pseudo-Boolean optimization) using the pure parsimony criterion.","homepage":"http://sat.inesc-id.pt/software/rpoly/","name":"RPOLY","version":["1.2.1"]}}
