The utility of cosmid and oligonucleotide platforms to identify human chromosome 16 MARs from preparations that employed LIS (lithium di-iodosalicylic acid) and NaCl extraction protocols was examined. The effectiveness of the platforms was then evaluated by Q-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR). Analysis revealed that caution must be exercised, since the representation of non-coding regions varies among platforms. Nevertheless, several interesting trends were revealed. We expect that these technologies will prove useful in systems approaches directed towards defining the role of MARs in various cell types and cellular processes. ©2007 Biochemical Society.",
