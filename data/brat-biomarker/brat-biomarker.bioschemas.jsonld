      "sc:description": "The Biomarker Reliability Assessment Tool (BRAT) was developed to help researchers set targets to improve exposure assessment in studies of chemicals with a short half-life. The BRAT software uses a simple pharmacokinetic model to simulate exposure, internal levels, and resulting urinary levels in individuals from a population based on user-specified inputs (e.g., biological half-life, within- and between-person variability in exposure). Based on internal levels (a toxicologically-relevant exposure metric) and urinary levels in the simulated population, the tool evaluates – through linear regression and quantile classification – the accuracy of the estimation of internal levels depending on the number of urine samples.",
