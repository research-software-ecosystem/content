    "description": "making graph genomes intuitive to commuters | displays multiple genomic sequences in the form of a tube map | A JavaScript module for the visualization of genomic sequence graphs. It automatically generates a \"tube map\"-like visualization of sequence graphs which have been created with vg | Link to working demo: https://vgteam.github.io/sequenceTubeMap/ | Run Sequence Tube Maps On Your Own | If you are using vg and want visualize the graphs it generates, the online version is limited to small file sizes. For visualizing bigger data sets you can run Sequence Tube Maps on your own. You can either run Tube Maps completely on your local (Linux) machine or use your local browser to access Tube Maps running on any other (Linux) machine you have access to",

Published by Oxford University Press.Compared to traditional haploid reference genomes, graph genomes are an efficient and compact data structure for storing multiple genomic sequences, for storing polymorphisms or for mapping sequencing reads with greater sensitivity. Further, graphs are well-studied computer science objects that can be efficiently analyzed. However, their adoption in genomic research is slow, in part because of the cognitive difficulty in interpreting graphs. Results: We present an intuitive graphical representation for graph genomes that re-uses well-honed techniques developed to display public transport networks, and demonstrate it as a web tool.
