When tested on mouse RNA-seq data, >31,000 splice events were predicted, of which 88% bridged between two regions separated by ≤100 kb, and 74% connected two exons of the same RefSeq gene. Our method also reports genomic rearrangements such as insertions and deletions. © 2010 Ameur et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Ameur A.","Wetterbom A.","Feuk L.","Gyllensten U."],"cit_count":62,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"20236510","title":"Global and unbiased detection of splice junctions from RNA-seq data","year":"2010-03-17"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:splitseek","biotoolsID":"splitseek","description":"De novo prediction of splice junctions in short-read RNA-seq data, suitable for detection of novel splicing events and chimeric transcripts.","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2864574/","name":"SplitSeek"}}
