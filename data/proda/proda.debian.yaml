summary: multiple alignment of protein sequences
description: >
   ProDA is a system for automated detection and alignment of homologous
   regions in collections of proteins with arbitrary domain architectures.
   Given an input set of unaligned sequences, ProDA identifies all
   homologous regions appearing in one or more sequences, and returns a
   collection of local multiple alignments for these regions.
