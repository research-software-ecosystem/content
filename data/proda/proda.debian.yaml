description: ProDA is a system for automated detection and alignment of homologous
  regions in collections of proteins with arbitrary domain architectures. Given an
  input set of unaligned sequences, ProDA identifies all homologous regions appearing
  in one or more sequences, and returns a collection of local multiple alignments
  for these regions.
