Since the availability of sufficient protein structures to tackle complex problems such as modeling backbone moves or docking remains a problem, alternative approaches using small, recurrent protein fragments have been employed. Here we present two databases that provide a vast resource for implementing such fragment-based strategies. The BriX database contains fragments from over 7000 non-homologous proteins from the Astral collection, segmented in lengths from 4 to 14 residues and clustered according to structural similarity, summing up to a content of 2 million fragments per length. To overcome the lack of loops classified in BriX, we constructed the Loop BriX database of non-regular structure elements, clustered according to end-to-end distance between the regular residues flanking the loop. Both databases are available online (http://brix.crg.es) and can be accessed through a user-friendly web-interface. For highthroughput queries a web-based API is provided, as well as full database downloads. In addition, two exciting applications are provided as online services: (i) user-submitted structures can be covered on the fly with BriX classes, representing putative structural variation throughout the protein and (ii) gaps or low-confidence regions in these structures can be bridged with matching fragments. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 29, "authors": [{"name": "Vanhee P."}, {"name": "Verschueren E."}, {"name": "Baeten L."}, {"name": "Stricher F."}, {"name": "Serrano L."}, {"name": "Rousseau F."}, {"name": "Schymkowitz J."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Luis Serrano", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "luis.serrano@crg.es"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:brix", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://brix.crg.es", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0477"}, {"term": "Protein modelling (backbone)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0479"}, {"term": "Residue distance calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2950"}, {"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}, {"term": "Protein modelling (loops)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0481"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Vast database of protein fragments, clustered on their backbone similarity.
