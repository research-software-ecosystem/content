Cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s) are metabolic enzymes that process the majority of FDA-approved, small-molecule drugs. Understanding how these enzymes modify molecule structure is key to the development of safe, effective drugs. XenoSite server is an online implementation of the XenoSite, a recently published computational model for P450 metabolism. XenoSite predicts which atomic sites of a molecule - sites of metabolism (SOMs) - are modified by P450s. XenoSite server accepts input in common chemical file formats including SDF and SMILES and provides tools for visualizing the likelihood that each atomic site is a site of metabolism for a variety of important P450s, as well as a flat file download of SOM predictions.","authors":["Matlock M.K.","Hughes T.B.","Swamidass S.J."],"cit_count":15,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25411327","title":"XenoSite server: A web-available site of metabolism prediction tool","year":"2015-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:xenosite","biotoolsID":"xenosite","description":"It provides prediction web services for small molecule biochemistry.
