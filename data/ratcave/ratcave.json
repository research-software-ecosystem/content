This library makes 3D programming intuitive to new users by providing 3D graphics engine concepts (Mesh, Scene, Light, and Camera classes) that can be manipulated using an interface similar to existing 2D stimulus libraries. In addition, the use of modern OpenGL constructs by Ratcave helps scientists create fast, hardware-accelerated dynamic stimuli using the same intuitive high-level, lightweight interface. Because Ratcave supplements, rather than replaces, existing Python stimulus libraries, scientists can continue to use their preferred libraries by simply adding Ratcave graphics to their existing experiments. We hope this tool will be useful both as a stimulus library and as an example of how tightly-focused libraries can add quality to the existing scientific open-source software ecosystem.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Del Grosso N.A."}, {"name": "Sirota A."}], "date": "2019-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Behavior Research Methods"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Del Grosso NA", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "delgrosso@bio.lmu.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:Ratcave", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/ratcave/ratcave", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-10-31T12:13:18Z", "otherID": [], "description": "3D graphics python package for cognitive psychology experiments.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/ratcave/ratcave/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}], "biotoolsID": "Ratcave", "additionDate": "2019-08-09T13:14:31Z", "name": "Ratcave", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [{"url": "https://ratcave.readthedocs.io/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
