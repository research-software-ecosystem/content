We took the broadest definition of sepsis, including the investigation of viral and non-infectious sepsis. We have included three short easy diagnostic criteria for the triage of the acute patient: Respiratory rate, Systolic Blood Pressure and Alert/non-alert which trigger a management pathway.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'auditable'","homepage":"https://www.somanz.org/guidelines.asp","name":"SOMANZ"}}
