    "description": "SOMANZ position paper on the management of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy and hyperemesis gravidarum.\n\nAPPROVAL OF WRITTEN GUIDELINES BY SOMANZ.\n\nThere are two proposed methods of guideline development processes as detailed below:-.\n\nIn 2017 SOMANZ published a multi-disciplinary guideline for the management of sepsis in pregnancy and the post-partum period. We took the broadest definition of sepsis, including the investigation of viral and non-infectious sepsis. We have included three short easy diagnostic criteria for the triage of the acute patient: Respiratory rate, Systolic Blood Pressure and Alert/non-alert which trigger a management pathway.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'auditable'",
