  "sc:description": "Count the number of MS/MS ions in a given spectrum to determine the unambiguous localization of a post-translational modification (PTM). The software lists number and type of site determining ions found between the assigned PTM localization by Mascot (Matrix Science) and the closest other amino acids which can host the modification. The PTMs included in the script are phosphorylation (S,T,Y), acetylation (K), mono- and dimethylation (K,R) and trimethylation (K).",
