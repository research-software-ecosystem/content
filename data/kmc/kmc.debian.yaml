description: "The kmc software is designed for counting k-mers (sequences of consecutive\
  \ k symbols) in a set of reads. K-mer counting is important for many bioinformatics\
  \ applications, e.g. developing de Bruijn graph assemblers. . Building de Bruijn\
  \ graphs is a commonly used approach for genome assembly with data from second-generation\
  \ sequencing. Unfortunately, sequencing errors (frequent in practice) result in\
  \ huge memory requirements for de Bruijn graphs, as well as long build time. One\
  \ of the popular approaches to handle this problem is filtering the input reads\
  \ in such a way that unique k-mers (very likely obtained as a result of an error)\
  \ are discarded. . Thus, KMC scans the raw reads and produces a compact representation\
  \ of all non-unique reads accompanied with number of their occurrences. The algorithm\
  \ implemented in KMC makes use mostly of disk space rather than RAM, which allows\
  \ one to use KMC even on rather typical personal computers. When run on high-end\
  \ servers (what is necessary for KMC competitors) it outperforms them in both memory\
  \ requirements and speed of computation. The disk space necessary for computation\
  \ is in order of the size of input data (usually it is smaller).\n"
