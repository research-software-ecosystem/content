description: The kmc software is designed for counting k-mers (sequences of consecutive
  k symbols) in a set of reads. K-mer counting is important for many bioinformatics
  applications, e.g. developing de Bruijn graph assemblers. . Building de Bruijn graphs
  is a commonly used approach for genome assembly with data from second-generation
  sequencing. Unfortunately, sequencing errors (frequent in practice) result in huge
  memory requirements for de Bruijn graphs, as well as long build time. One of the
  popular approaches to handle this problem is filtering the input reads in such a
  way that unique k-mers (very likely obtained as a result of an error) are discarded.
  . Thus, KMC scans the raw reads and produces a compact representation of all non-unique
  reads accompanied with number of their occurrences. The algorithm implemented in
  KMC makes use mostly of disk space rather than RAM, which allows one to use KMC
  even on rather typical personal computers. When run on high-end servers (what is
  necessary for KMC competitors) it outperforms them in both memory requirements and
  speed of computation. The disk space necessary for computation is in order of the
  size of input data (usually it is smaller).
