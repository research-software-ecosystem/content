Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Building the histogram of occurrences of every k-symbol long substring of nucleotide data is a standard step in many bioinformatics applications, known under the name of k-mer counting. Its applications include developing de Bruijn graph genome assemblers, fast multiple sequence alignment and repeat detection. The tremendous amounts of NGS data require fast algorithms for k-mer counting, preferably using moderate amounts of memory. Results: We present a novel method for k-mer counting, on large datasets about twice faster than the strongest competitors (Jellyfish 2, KMC 1), using about 12∈GB (or less) of RAM. Our disk-based method bears some resemblance to MSPKmerCounter, yet replacing the original minimizers with signatures (a carefully selected subset of all minimizers) and using (k, x)-mers allows to significantly reduce the I/O and a highly parallel overall architecture allows to achieve unprecedented processing speeds. For example, KMC 2 counts the 28-mers of a human reads collection with 44-fold coverage (106∈GB of compressed size) in about 20∈min, on a 6-core Intel i7 PC with an solid-state disk.","authors":["Deorowicz S.","Kokot M.","Grabowski S.","Debudaj-Grabysz A."],"cit_count":75,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25609798","title":"KMC 2: Fast and resource-frugal k-mer counting","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:kmc","biotoolsID":"kmc","description":"KMC is a utility designed for counting k-mers (sequences of consecutive k symbols) in a set of reads from genome sequencing projects.","homepage":"http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/index.php?page=projects&project=kmc&subpage=about","name":"KMC"}}
