It combines pattern matching and weight matrix approaches thus providing higher accuracy of recognition than each of the methods alone. P-Match is closely interconnected with the TRANSFAC® database. In particular, P-Match uses the matrix library as well as sets of aligned known TF-binding sites collected in TRANSFAC® and therefore provides the possibility to search for a large variety of different TF binding sites. Using results of extensive tests of recognition accuracy, we selected three sets of optimized cut-off values that minimize either false negatives or false positives, or the sum of both errors. Comparison with the weight matrix approaches such as Match™ tool shows that P-Match generally provides superior recognition accuracy in the area of low false negative errors (high sensitivity). As familiar to the user of Match™, P-Match also allows to save user-specific profiles that include selected subsets of matrices with corresponding TF-binding sites or user-defined cut-off values. Furthermore, a number of tissue-specific profiles are provided that were compiled by the TRANSFAC® team. A public version of the P-Match tool is available at http://www.gene-regulation.com/cgi-bin/ pub/programs/pmatch/bin/p-match.cgi. © 2005 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Chekmenev D.S.","Haid C.","Kel A.E."],"cit_count":136,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15980505","title":"P-Match: Transcription factor binding site search by combining patterns and weight matrices","year":"2005-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:p-match","biotoolsID":"p-match","description":"Transcription factor binding site identification tool that increases its accuracy by combining weight matrix and pattern matching approaches.
