    "description": "Global Peptide-Protein Docking with Structural Templates.\n\nAbstract Motivation Interactions between proteins and peptides or peptide-like intrinsically disordered regions are involved in many important biological processes, such as gene expression and cell life-cycle regulation. Experimentally determining the structure of such interactions is time-consuming, and because of the disordered nature of the ligand, the interactions are especially difficult to predict through software, requiring specialized solutions. Although several prediction-methods exist, most are limited in performance or availability. Results InterPep2 is a freely available method for predicting the structure of peptide-protein interactions. We have previously shown that structural templates can be used to accurately predict peptide-protein binding sites, and that using templates from regular protein-protein interactions will increase the number of sites found",
