  "sc:description": "Contains the results of the alignment of probe sequences from five Affymetrix expression microarrays to the human genome. Probes matching the transcript-coding regions in the correct orientation have been determined. For each such probe alignment region, the mRNA and EST sequences that contain the probe sequence have also been determined. In the textual part of the database interface, data on the sequences that cover the probe alignment region and SNPs that are located inside it is summarized.",
