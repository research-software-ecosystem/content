  "sc:description": "Genomic-led target prioritisation system, with the focus on leveraging human genetic data to prioritize potential drug targets at the gene, pathway and network level. The long-term goal is to use such information to enhance early-stage target validation. Based on evidence of disease association from genome-wide association studies, this prioritisation system can generate evidence to support identification of the specific modulated genes that are responsible for the genetic association signal.",
