    "description": "predictor for cellular protein stability.\n\nTool for classification of protein variations predictor.\n\nA benchmark database for variations.\n\nDatasets for training and testing cellular protein stability predictor ProTstab:.\n\nStability of biomolecules, especially of proteins, is of great interest and significance. Protein stability has been the major target for protein engineering, mainly to increase the stability, but sometimes also to destabilize proteins . Effects on stability are among the most common consequences for disease-related variations , thus this phenomenon is of interest for variation interpretation to explain the effects of harmful variants.\n\nWe trained a novel machine learning tool for prediction of protein stability, especially melting temperature Tm. The tool is based on amino acid sequence information and using GBRT (Gradient boosting of regression trees) algorithm.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Stability is one of the most fundamental intrinsic characteristics of proteins and can be determined with various methods. Characterization of protein properties does not keep pace with increase in new sequence data and therefore even basic properties are not known for far majority of identified proteins. There have been some attempts to develop predictors for protein stabilities; however, they have suffered from small numbers of known examples. Results: We took benefit of results from a recently developed cellular stability method, which is based on limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry, and developed a machine learning method using gradient boosting of regression trees. ProTstab method has high performance and is well suited for large scale prediction of protein stabilities. Conclusions: The Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.793 in 10-fold cross validation and 0.763 in independent blind test. The corresponding values for mean absolute error are 0.024 and 0.036, respectively. Comparison with a previously published method indicated ProTstab to have superior performance. We used the method to predict stabilities of all the remaining proteins in the entire human proteome and then correlated the predicted stabilities to protein chain lengths of isoforms and to localizations of proteins.",
