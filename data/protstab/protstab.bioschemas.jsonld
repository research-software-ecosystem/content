Protein stability has been the major target for protein engineering, mainly to increase the stability, but sometimes also to destabilize proteins . Effects on stability are among the most common consequences for disease-related variations , thus this phenomenon is of interest for variation interpretation to explain the effects of harmful variants.\n\nWe trained a novel machine learning tool for prediction of protein stability, especially melting temperature Tm. The tool is based on amino acid sequence information and using GBRT (Gradient boosting of regression trees) algorithm.",
