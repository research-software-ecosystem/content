  "sc:description": "Wrapping an array-like object in a DelayedArray object allows one to perform common array operations on it without loading the object in memory. In order to reduce memory usage and optimize performance, operations on the object are either delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism. Note that this also works on in-memory array-like objects like DataFrame objects, Matrix objects, and ordinary arrays and data frames.",
