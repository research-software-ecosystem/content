    "description": "GeneWalk identifies relevant gene functions for a biological context using network representation learning | GeneWalk determines for individual genes the functions that are relevant in a particular biological context and experimental condition. GeneWalk quantifies the similarity between vector representations of a gene and annotated GO terms through representation learning with random walks on a condition-specific gene regulatory network. Similarity significance is determined through comparison with node similarities from randomized networks",

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment methods provide insight at the gene set level. Here, we introduce GeneWalk (github.com/churchmanlab/genewalk) that identifies individual genes and their relevant functions critical for the experimental setting under examination. After the automatic assembly of an experiment-specific gene regulatory network, GeneWalk uses representation learning to quantify the similarity between vector representations of each gene and its GO annotations, yielding annotation significance scores that reflect the experimental context. By performing gene- and condition-specific functional analysis, GeneWalk converts a list of genes into data-driven hypotheses.",
