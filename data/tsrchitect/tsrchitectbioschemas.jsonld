  "sc:description": "It allows the user to efficiently identify the putative promoter from a variety of TSS profiling data types, including both single-end as well as paired-end. In addition, it provides the ability to import aligned EST and cDNA data. Along with the coordiantes of identified TSRs, TSRchitect also calculates the width, abundance and two forms of the Shape Index, and handles biological replicates for expression profiling.",
