To study the association of polymorphic loci of matrix metalloproteinases with the development of essential hypertension (EH) in men of the Central Chernozem Region of Russia. Materials and methods. A study of 564 men with EH and 257 control men was performed. Analysis of the polymorphic loci of metalloproteinases rs11568818 MMР7, rs1320632 MMР8, rs11225395 MMР8, rs1799750 MMР1, rs3025058 MMР3 was performed using real-time PCR",
