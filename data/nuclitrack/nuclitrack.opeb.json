Live imaging studies give unparalleled insight into dynamic single cell behaviours and fate decisions. However, the challenge of reliably tracking single cells over long periods of time limits both the throughput and ease with which such studies can be performed. Here, we present NucliTrack, a cross platform solution for automatically segmenting, tracking and extracting features from fluorescently labelled nuclei. NucliTrack performs similarly to other state-of-the-art cell tracking algorithms, but NucliTrack's interactive, graphical interface makes it significantly more user friendly.","authors":["Cooper S.","Barr A.R.","Glen R.","Bakal C."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx404","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"NucliTrack: An integrated nuclei tracking application","year":"2017-10-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nuclitrack","biotoolsID":"nuclitrack","description":"Integrated nuclei tracking application .","homepage":"http://nuclitrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","name":"NucliTrack"}}
