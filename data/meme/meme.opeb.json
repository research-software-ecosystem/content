All rights reserved. Precise regulatory control of genes, particularly in eukaryotes, frequently requires the joint action of multiple sequence-specific transcription factors. A cis-regulatory module (CRM) is a genomic locus that is responsible for gene regulation and that contains multiple transcription factor binding sites in close proximity. Given a collection of known transcription factor binding motifs, many bioinformatics methods have been proposed over the past 15 years for identifying within a genomic sequence candidate CRMs consisting of clusters of those motifs. Results: The MCAST algorithm uses a hidden Markov model with a P-value-based scoring scheme to identify candidate CRMs. Here, we introduce a new version of MCAST that offers improved graphical output, a dynamic background model, statistical confidence estimates based on false discovery rate estimation and, most significantly, the ability to predict CRMs while taking into account epigenomic data such as DNase I sensitivity or histone modification data. We demonstrate the validity of MCAST's statistical confidence estimates and the utility of epigenomic priors in identifying CRMs.","authors":["Grant C.E.","Johnson J.","Bailey T.L.","Noble W.S."],"cit_count":2,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26704599","title":"MCAST: Scanning for cis-regulatory motif clusters","year":"2016-04-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:meme","biotoolsID":"meme","description":"Tool for discovering motifs in a group of related DNA or protein sequences.
