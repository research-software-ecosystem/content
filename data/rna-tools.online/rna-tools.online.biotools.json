Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Significant improvements have been made in the efficiency and accuracy of RNA 3D structure prediction methods in recent years; however, many tools developed in the field stay exclusive to only a few bioinformatic groups. To perform a complete RNA 3D structure modeling analysis as proposed by the RNA-Puzzles community, researchers must familiarize themselves with a quite complex set of tools. In order to facilitate the processing of RNA sequences and structures, we previously developed the rna-tools package. However, using rna-tools requires the installation of a mixture of libraries and tools, basic knowledge of the command line and the Python programming language. To provide an opportunity for the broader community of biologists to take advantage of the new developments in RNA structural biology, we developed rna-tools.online. The web server provides a user-friendly platform to perform many standard analyses required for the typical modeling workflow: 3D structure manipulation and editing, structure minimization, structure analysis, quality assessment, and comparison. rna-tools.online supports biologists to start benefiting from the maturing field of RNA 3D structural bioinformatics and can be used for educational purposes. The web server is available at https://rna-tools.online.",
