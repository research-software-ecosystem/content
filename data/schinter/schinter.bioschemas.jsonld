      "sc:description": "Imputing dropout events for single-cell RNA-seq data with limited sample size | scHinter is a Matlab package for imputing dropout events for scRNA-seq with special emphasis on data with limited sample size. scHinter consists of three modules (Figure 1), incorporates a voting-based consensus distance and leverages the synthetic minority over-sampling technique for random interpolation. A hierarchical framework is also embedded in scHinter to increase the reliability of the imputation for small samples. The imputed expression matrix from scHinter can be used for as inputs for other existing scRNA-seq pipelines or tools for downstream analyses, such as cell type clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization",
