A hierarchical framework is also embedded in scHinter to increase the reliability of the imputation for small samples. The imputed expression matrix from scHinter can be used for as inputs for other existing scRNA-seq pipelines or tools for downstream analyses, such as cell type clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization","homepage":"https://github.com/BMILAB/scHinter","name":"scHinter"}}
