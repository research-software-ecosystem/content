  "sc:description": "It is a unique comparative genomics database from plant-genome-based proteome data sets. Evolutionarily conserved motifs were extracted by MEME software from protein-sequence annotation groups selected by BLASTP from the proteome data sets of 10 species: rice, sorghum, Arabidopsis thaliana, grape, a lycophyte, a moss, 3 algae, and yeast. Similarity clustering of each protein group was performed by pairwise scoring of the motif patterns of the sequences.",
