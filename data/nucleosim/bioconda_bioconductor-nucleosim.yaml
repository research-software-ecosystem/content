about:
  description: "This package can generate a synthetic map with reads covering the\
    \ nucleosome regions as well as a synthetic map with forward and reverse reads\
    \ emulating next-generation sequencing. The synthetic hybridization data of \u201C\
    Tiling Arrays\u201D can also be generated. The user has choice between three different\
    \ distributions for the read positioning: Normal, Student and Uniform. In addition,\
    \ a visualization tool is provided to explore the synthetic nucleosome maps."
