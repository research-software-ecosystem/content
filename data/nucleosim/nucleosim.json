Recent next generation CHIP-chip and CHIP-Seq technologies have accelerated our understanding of basic principles of chromatin organization. These technologies have taught us that nucleosomes play a crucial role in gene regulation by allowing physical access to transcription factors. Recent methods and experimental advancements allow the determination of nucleosome positions for a given genome area. However, most of these methods estimate the number of nucleosomes either by an EM algorithm using a BIC criterion or an effective heuristic strategy. Here, we introduce a Bayesian method for identifying nucleosome positions. The proposed model is based on a Multinomial-Dirichlet classification and a hierarchical mixture distributions. The number and the positions of nucleosomes are estimated using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation technique. We compare the performance of our method on simulated data and MNase-Seq data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae against PING and NOrMAL methods.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Samb R."}, {"name": "Khadraoui K."}, {"name": "Belleau P."}, {"name": "Deschenes A."}, {"name": "Lakhal-Chaieb L."}, {"name": "Droit A."}], "date": "2015-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Astrid Deschenes", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Astrid-Louise.Deschenes@crchudequebec.ulaval.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:nucleosim", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/nucleoSim.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "DNA mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2520"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package can generate a synthetic map with reads covering the nucleosome regions as well as a synthetic map with forward and reverse reads emulating next-generation sequencing.
