description: "This package can generate a synthetic map with reads covering the nucleosome\
  \ regions as well as a synthetic map with forward and reverse reads emulating next-generation\
  \ sequencing. The synthetic hybridization data of \u201CTiling Arrays\u201D can\
  \ also be generated. The user has choice between three different distributions for\
  \ the read positioning: Normal, Student and Uniform. In addition, a visualization\
  \ tool is provided to explore the synthetic nucleosome maps."
