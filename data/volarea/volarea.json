The software calculates the surface area and the volume of molecular structures, as well as the volume of molecular cavities. The surface area facility can be used to calculate the solvent-exposed surface area of a molecule or the contact area between two molecules. The volume algorithm can be used to predict not only the space occupied by any molecular structure, but also the volume of cavities, such as tunnels or clefts. The software finds wide application in the characterization of systems, such as protein/ligand complexes, enzyme active sites, protein/protein interfaces, enzyme channels, membrane pores, solvent tunnels, among others. Some examples are given to illustrate its potential. VolArea is as a plug-in of the widely distributed software Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) and is freely available at http://www.fc.up.pt/PortoBioComp/ Software/Volarea/Home.html. VolArea is a new software that allows for a rapid and fully automated analysis of the surface area and volume of molecular structures, as well as the volume of molecular cavities. \u00a9 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Ribeiro J.V."}, {"name": "Tamames J.A.C."}, {"name": "Cerqueira N.M.F.S.A."}, {"name": "Fernandes P.A."}, {"name": "Ramos M.J."}], "date": "2013-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Chemical Biology and Drug Design"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.fc.up.pt/PortoBioComp/Software/Volarea/Home.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "joao.ribeiro@fc.up.pt"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mjramos@fc.up.pt"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:volarea", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.fc.up.pt/PortoBioComp/Software/Volarea/Home.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular surface analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3351"}, {"term": "Protein property calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0250"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Plug-in of the widely spread molecular graphics software Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD), which allows the calculation of the volume as well as the surface area of any chemical structure.
