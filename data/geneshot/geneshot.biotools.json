Geneshot finds publications that mention both the search terms and genes. It then prioritizes these genes using various methods: 1) list of genes from publications; 2) predicted genes using gene-gene similarity matrices derived from a variety of resources ( ARCHS4 : Enrichr : Tagger : AutoRIF : GeneRIF ) | Examples: Wound healing : Hair loss : Trichostatin A : Glioblastoma : Diabetes",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).The frequency by which genes are studied correlates with the prior knowledge accumulated about them. This leads to an imbalance in research attention where some genes are highly investigated while others are ignored. Geneshot is a search engine developed to illuminate this gap and to promote attention to the under-studied genome. Through a simple web interface, Geneshot enables researchers to enter arbitrary search terms, to receive ranked lists of genes relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were previously published in association with the search terms, as well as genes predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive visualizations. To predict gene function, Geneshot utilizes gene-gene similarity matrices from processed RNA-seq data, or from gene-gene co-occurrence data obtained from multiple sources. In addition, Geneshot can be used to analyze the novelty of gene sets and augment gene sets with additional relevant genes. The Geneshot web-server and API are freely and openly available from https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot.",
