                "abstract": "The continuous improvement of computer architectures allows for the simulation of molecular systems of growing sizes. However, such calculations still require the input of initial structures, which are also becoming increasingly complex. In this work, we present CAT, a Compound Attachment Tool (source code available at https://github.com/nlesc-nano/CAT) and Python package for the automatic construction of composite chemical compounds, which supports the functionalization of organic, inorganic, and hybrid organic-inorganic materials. The CAT workflow consists in defining the anchoring sites on the reference material, usually a large molecular system denoted as a scaffold, and on the molecular species that are attached to it, i.e., the ligands. Usually, ligands are pre-optimized in a conformation biased toward more linear structures to minimize interligand(s) steric interactions, a bias that is important when multiple ligands are attached onto the scaffold. The resulting superstructure(s) are then stored in various formats that can be used afterward in quantum chemical calculations or classical force field-based simulations.",
