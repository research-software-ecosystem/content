    "description": "It can be used to construct genetic linkage maps and perform functional QTL mapping with molecular markers generated in a full-sib family. For linkage analysis, it utilizes seven segregation types of markers to estimate the recombination and simultaneously predict the linkage phase between any two markers. It takes heuristic search method for ordering large number of markers of a linkage group by incorporating local ordering methods.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Functional mapping that embeds the developmental mechanisms of complex traits shows great power to study the dynamic pattern of genetic effects triggered by individual quantitative trait loci (QTLs). A full-sib family, produced by crossing two heterozygous parents, is characteristic of uncertainties about crosstype at a locus and linkage phase between different loci. Integrating functional mapping into a full-sib family requires a model selection procedure capable of addressing these uncertainties. 3FunMap, written in VC++ 6.0, provides a flexible and extensible platform to perform full-sib functional mapping of dynamic traits. Functions in the pdackage encompass linkage phase determination, marker map construction and the pattern identification of QTL segregation, dynamic tests of QTL effects, permutation tests and numerical simulation. We demonstrate the features of 3FunMap through real data analysis and computer simulation. \u00a9 The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
