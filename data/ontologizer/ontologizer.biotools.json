The Ontologizer implements the standard approach to statistical analysis based on the one-sided Fisher's exact test, the novel parent-child method, as well as topology-based algorithms. A number of multiple-testing correction procedures are provided. The Ontologizer allows users to visualize data as a graph including all significantly overrepresented GO terms and to explore the data by linking GO terms to all genes/proteins annotated to the term and by linking individual terms to child terms. \u00a9 The Author 2008.
