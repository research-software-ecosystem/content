The machine learning algorithm CorEx has shown utility in analyzing differential expression of groups of genes in tumor RNA-seq in a way that may be helpful for advancing precision oncology. However, CorEx produces many factors that can be challenging to analyze and connect to existing understanding. To facilitate such connections, we have built a website, CorExplorer, that allows users to interactively explore the data and answer common questions related to its analysis. We trained CorEx on RNA-seq gene expression data for four tumor types: ovarian, lung, melanoma, and colorectal. We then incorporated corresponding survival, protein-protein interactions, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichments, and heatmaps into the website for association with the factor graph visualization. Here we employ example protocols to illustrate use of the database for comprehending the significance of the learned tumor factors in the context of this external data.","authors":["Pepke S.","Nelson W.M.","Ver Steeg G."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.3791/60431","journal":"Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE","pmid":"31657800","title":"Analyzing Tumor Gene Expression Factors with the CorExplorer Web Portal","year":"2019-10-11"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CorEx","biotoolsID":"CorEx","description":"Analyzing Tumor Gene Expression Factors with the CorExplorer Web Portal.\n\nWelcome to the CorEx portal for gene expression analysis!.\n\nThis website began as an extension of work applying the CorEx machine learning algorithm to gene expression data from ovarian cancer tumors as presented in this paper.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/rseqflow (ISI.EDU), bio.tools/dbsnp-q (ISI.EDU).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CorExplorer'","homepage":"http://corex.isi.edu","name":"CorEx"}}
