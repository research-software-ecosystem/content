description: DEXUS identifies differentially expressed genes in RNA-Seq data under
  all possible study designs such as studies without replicates, without sample groups,
  and with unknown conditions. DEXUS works also for known conditions, for example
  for RNA-Seq data with two or multiple conditions. RNA-Seq read count data can be
  provided both by the S4 class Count Data Set and by read count matrices. Differentially
  expressed transcripts can be visualized by heatmaps, in which unknown conditions,
  replicates, and samples groups are also indicated. This software is fast since the
  core algorithm is written in C. For very large data sets, a parallel version of
  DEXUS is provided in this package. DEXUS is a statistical model that is selected
  in a Bayesian framework by an EM algorithm. DEXUS does not need replicates to detect
  differentially expressed transcripts, since the replicates (or conditions) are estimated
  by the EM method for each transcript. The method provides an informative/non-informative
  value to extract differentially expressed transcripts at a desired significance
  level or power.
