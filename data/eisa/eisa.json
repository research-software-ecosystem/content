    "description": "The Iterative Signature Algorithm (ISA) is a biclustering method; it finds correlated blocks (transcription modules) in gene expression (or other tabular) data. The ISA is capable of finding overlapping modules and it is resilient to noise. This package provides a convenient interface to the ISA, using standard BioConductor data structures; and also contains various visualization tools that can be used with other biclustering algorithms.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: The use of gene microchips has enabled a rapid accumulation of gene-expression data. One of the major challenges of analyzing this data is the diversity, in both size and signal strength, of the various modules in the gene regulatory networks of organisms. Results: Based on the iterative signature algorithm [Bergmann,S., Ihmels,J. and Barkai,N. (2002) Phys. Rev. E 67, 031902], we present an algorithm - the progressive iterative signature algorithm (PISA) - that, by sequentially eliminating modules, allows unsupervised identification of both large and small regulatory modules. We applied PISA to a large set of yeast gene-expression data, and, using the Gene Ontology database as a reference, found that the algorithm is much better able to identify regulatory modules than methods based on high-throughput transcription-factor binding experiments or on comparative genomics. \u00a9 The Author 2004.
