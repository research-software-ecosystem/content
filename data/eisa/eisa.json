One of the major challenges of analyzing this data is the diversity, in both size and signal strength, of the various modules in the gene regulatory networks of organisms. Results: Based on the iterative signature algorithm [Bergmann,S., Ihmels,J. and Barkai,N. (2002) Phys. Rev. E 67, 031902], we present an algorithm - the progressive iterative signature algorithm (PISA) - that, by sequentially eliminating modules, allows unsupervised identification of both large and small regulatory modules. We applied PISA to a large set of yeast gene-expression data, and, using the Gene Ontology database as a reference, found that the algorithm is much better able to identify regulatory modules than methods based on high-throughput transcription-factor binding experiments or on comparative genomics. \u00a9 The Author 2004.
