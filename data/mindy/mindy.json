These include, among others, microRNA-mediated control of transcription factor (TF) mRNA translation and degradation, transcription factor activation by phosphorylation and acetylation, formation of active complexes with one or more cofactors, and mRNA/protein degradation and stabilization processes. Thus, the ability of a transcription factor to regulate its targets depends on a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, resulting in highly context-dependent regulatory networks. In this chapter, we introduce a step-by-step guide on how to use the MINDy systems biology algorithm (Modulator Inference by Network Dynamics) that we recently developed, for the genome-wide, context-specific identification of posttranscriptional and posttranslational modulators of transcription factor activity. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "citationCount": 12, "authors": [{"name": "Bansal M."}, {"name": "Califano A."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Methods in Molecular Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Andrea Califano", "url": "http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/califanolab/index.php/Main_Page", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ac2248@cumc.columbia.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mindy", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/califanolab/index.php/Software/MINDY2?", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Promoter prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0440"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A new information theoretic method to identify multivariate statistical dependencies between a transcription factor and one or more of its targets, conditional on the presence (or absence) of a candidate modulator gene.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mindy-2-genome-wide-discovery-modulators-transcriptional-interactions.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mindy", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:49:34Z", "name": "MINDY", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://califano.c2b2.columbia.edu/software/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
