These include, among others, microRNA-mediated control of transcription factor (TF) mRNA translation and degradation, transcription factor activation by phosphorylation and acetylation, formation of active complexes with one or more cofactors, and mRNA/protein degradation and stabilization processes. Thus, the ability of a transcription factor to regulate its targets depends on a variety of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, resulting in highly context-dependent regulatory networks. In this chapter, we introduce a step-by-step guide on how to use the MINDy systems biology algorithm (Modulator Inference by Network Dynamics) that we recently developed, for the genome-wide, context-specific identification of posttranscriptional and posttranslational modulators of transcription factor activity. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","authors":["Bansal M.","Califano A."],"cit_count":12,"journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","pmid":"21938624","title":"Genome-wide dissection of posttranscriptional and posttranslational interactions","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mindy","biotoolsID":"mindy","description":"A new information theoretic method to identify multivariate statistical dependencies between a transcription factor and one or more of its targets, conditional on the presence (or absence) of a candidate modulator gene.","homepage":"http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/califanolab/index.php/Software/MINDY2?","name":"MINDY"}}
