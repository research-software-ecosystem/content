            "abstract": "Background: Recent high throughput sequencing technologies are capable of generating a huge amount of data for bacterial genome sequencing projects. Although current sequence assemblers successfully merge the overlapping reads, often several contigs remain which cannot be assembled any further. It is still costly and time consuming to close all the gaps in order to acquire the whole genomic sequence.Results: Here we propose an algorithm that takes several related genomes and their phylogenetic relationships into account to create a graph that contains the likelihood for each pair of contigs to be adjacent.Subsequently, this graph can be used to compute a layout graph that shows the most promising contig adjacencies in order to aid biologists in finishing the complete genomic sequence. The layout graph shows unique contig orderings where possible, and the best alternatives where necessary.Conclusions: Our new algorithm for contig ordering uses sequence similarity as well as phylogenetic information to estimate adjacencies of contigs. An evaluation of our implementation shows that it performs better than recent approaches while being much faster at the same time. © 2010 Husemann and Stoye; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",

Although the sequencing itself becomes easier and cheaper with each machine generation, the finishing of the genomes remains difficult. Instead of the desired whole genomic sequence, a set of contigs is the result of the assembly. In this applications note, we present the tool r2cat (related reference contig arrangement tool) that helps in the task of comparative assembly and also provides an interactive visualization for synteny inspection.

However, the assembly usually ends up in a set of contigs with gaps between them. If the sequences of one (or several) related genome(s) are already known, this information can be used to estimate the order and orientation of the contigs towards each other. This helps in the finishing phase of a sequencing project since it eases the design of specific primer sequences to fill the gaps.",
