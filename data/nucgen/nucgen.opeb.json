A set of local inter basepair parameters (viz, tilt, roll, twist, shift, slide and rise) have been defined, which use geometry and coordinates of two successive basepairs only and can be used to generate polymeric structures with varying geometries for each of the 16 possible dinucleotide steps. Intra basepair parameters, propeller, buckle, opening and the C6...C8 distance can also be varied, if required, while the sugar phosphate backbone atoms are fixed in some standard conformation in each of the nucleotides. NUPARM can be used to analyse both DNA and RNA structures, with single as well as double stranded helices. The NUCGEN software generates double helical models with the backbone fixed in B-form DNA, but with appropriate modifications in the input data, it can also generate A-form DNA and RNA duplex structures. © 1995 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Bansal M.","Bhattacharyya D.","Ravi B."],"cit_count":122,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"7583696","title":"NUPARM and NUCGEN: Software for analysis and generation of sequence dependent nucleic acid structures","year":"1995-06-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nucgen","biotoolsID":"nucgen","description":"Reads wedge (or local doublet) and basepair parameters calculates local helical parameters from local doublet parameters, then applies the base-pair and helical parameters to succesive  basepairs after transforming the already generated ones to bring the topmost one in the (x-y) plane.","homepage":"http://nucleix.mbu.iisc.ernet.in/nucgen/index.htm","name":"NUCGEN"}}
