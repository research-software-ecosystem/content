      "sc:description": "A surjective mapping approach for dimensionality reduction | Agglomerative Partitioning Framework for Dimension Reduction | A fast and flexible framework for agglomerative partitioning. 'partition' uses an approach called Direct-Measure-Reduce to create new variables that maintain the user-specified minimum level of information. Each reduced variable is also interpretable: the original variables map to one and only one variable in the reduced data set. 'partition' is flexible, as well: how variables are selected to reduce, how information loss is measured, and the way data is reduced can all be customized",
