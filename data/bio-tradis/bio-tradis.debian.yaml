description: 'Bio-Tradis contains a set of tools to analyse the output from TraDIS
  analyses. . The Bio-Tradis analysis pipeline is implemented as an extensible Perl
  library which can either be used as is, or as a basis for the development of more
  advanced analysis tools. . Please note: You need to manually install BioConductor
  Edger which can not be distributed by Debian in recent version since it is using
  non-distributable code locfit.'
