      "sc:description": "A Verification Checklist to Reduce Errors in Models and Improve Their Credibility.\n\nThis is the model verification repository.\n\nAn application example is uploaded on the repository. This example will be updated further and with other elaborated examples.\n\nThe TECH-VER checklist consists of five domains: (1) input calculations; (2) event-state (patient flow) calculations; (3) result calculations; (4) uncertainty analysis calculations; and (5) other overall checks (e.g. validity or interface).\n\nIn health economic literature, checklists or best practice recommendations on model validation credibility always declare verification of the programmed model as a fundamental step, such as ‘is the model implemented correctly and does the implementation accurately represent the conceptual model?’ However, to date, little operational guidance for the model verification process has been given",
