    "description": "A handy tool to rank anti-cancer synergistic drugs.\n\nH-RACS is designed to predict synergistic drug combinations based on drug features and basal expression profiling of cancer context. The advantages of H-RACS lie in 1) excellent performance with minimum data input compared to peers; 2) abundant cancer context built-in covering 928 cell lines of 24 cancers; 3) unique and outstanding extendibility to new drug combinations and new cell lines.",

All Rights Reserved.Though promising, identifying synergistic combinations from a large pool of candidate drugs remains challenging for cancer treatment. Due to unclear mechanism and limited confirmed cases, only a few computational algorithms are able to predict drug synergy. Yet they normally require the drug-cell treatment results as an essential input, thus exclude the possibility to pre-screen those unexplored drugs without cell treatment profiling. Based on the largest dataset of 33,574 combinational scenarios, we proposed a handy webserver, H-RACS, to overcome the above problems. Being loaded with chemical structures and target information, H-RACS can recommend potential synergistic pairs between candidate drugs on 928 cell lines of 24 prevalent cancer types. A high model performance was achieved with AUC of 0.89 on independent combinational scenarios. On the second independent validation of DREAM dataset, H-RACS obtained precision of 67% among its top 5% ranking list. When being tested on new combinations and new cell lines, H-RACS showed strong extendibility with AUC of 0.84 and 0.81 respectively. As the first online server freely accessible at http://www.badd-cao.net/h-racs, H-RACS may promote the pre-screening of synergistic combinations for new chemical drugs on unexplored cancers.",
