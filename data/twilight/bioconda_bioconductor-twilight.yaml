about:
  description: 'In a typical microarray setting with gene expression data observed
    under two conditions, the local false discovery rate describes the probability
    that a gene is not differentially expressed between the two conditions given its
    corrresponding observed score or p-value level. The resulting curve of p-values
    versus local false discovery rate offers an insight into the twilight zone between
    clear differential and clear non-differential gene expression. Package ''twilight''
    contains two main functions: Function twilight.pval performs a two-condition test
    on differences in means for a given input matrix or expression set and computes
    permutation based p-values. Function twilight performs a stochastic downhill search
    to estimate local false discovery rates and effect size distributions. The package
    further provides means to filter for permutations that describe the null distribution
    correctly. Using filtered permutations, the influence of hidden confounders could
    be diminished.'
