  "sc:description": "The Motif Enrichment Tool (MET) takes user-defined gene sets and identifies significantly associated sets of genes that share a regulatory motif. The tool is available for a number of model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafinch, stickleback, fruitfly, etc). It incorporates transcription factor DNA-specificity motifs taken from literature curation, bacterial one-hybrid assays, high-throughput SELEX experiments, and protein binding microarrays.",
