MET searches the appropriate regulatory region around each gene and identifies which transcription factor DNA-binding specificities (motifs) are statistically overrepresented. Motif enrichment analysis is currently available for many metazoan species including human, mouse, fruit fly, planaria and flowering plants. MET also leverages high-throughput experimental data such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq from ENCODE and ModENCODE to identify the regulatory targets of a transcription factor with greater precision. The results from MET are produced in real time and are linked to a genome browser for easy follow-up analysis. Use of the web tool is free and open to all, and there is no login requirement. © 2014 The Author(s).","authors":["Blatti C.","Sinha S."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gku456","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"Motif enrichment tool","year":"2014-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:met","biotoolsID":"met","description":"The Motif Enrichment Tool (MET) takes user-defined gene sets and identifies significantly associated sets of genes that share a regulatory motif.
