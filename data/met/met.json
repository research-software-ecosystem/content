MET searches the appropriate regulatory region around each gene and identifies which transcription factor DNA-binding specificities (motifs) are statistically overrepresented. Motif enrichment analysis is currently available for many metazoan species including human, mouse, fruit fly, planaria and flowering plants. MET also leverages high-throughput experimental data such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq from ENCODE and ModENCODE to identify the regulatory targets of a transcription factor with greater precision. The results from MET are produced in real time and are linked to a genome browser for easy follow-up analysis. Use of the web tool is free and open to all, and there is no login requirement. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Blatti C."}, {"name": "Sinha S."}], "date": "2014-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Charles Blatti", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "blatti@illinois.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:met", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://veda.cs.uiuc.edu/MET/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene set testing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3224"}, {"term": "Transcription factor binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0445"}, {"term": "Gene-set enrichment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2436"}, {"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The Motif Enrichment Tool (MET) takes user-defined gene sets and identifies significantly associated sets of genes that share a regulatory motif.
