    "description": "The Motif Enrichment Tool (MET) takes user-defined gene sets and identifies significantly associated sets of genes that share a regulatory motif. The tool is available for a number of model organisms (human, mouse, zebrafinch, stickleback, fruitfly, etc). It incorporates transcription factor DNA-specificity motifs taken from literature curation, bacterial one-hybrid assays, high-throughput SELEX experiments, and protein binding microarrays.",

                "abstract": "The Motif Enrichment Tool (MET) provides an online interface that enables users to find major transcriptional regulators of their gene sets of interest. MET searches the appropriate regulatory region around each gene and identifies which transcription factor DNA-binding specificities (motifs) are statistically overrepresented. Motif enrichment analysis is currently available for many metazoan species including human, mouse, fruit fly, planaria and flowering plants. MET also leverages high-throughput experimental data such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq from ENCODE and ModENCODE to identify the regulatory targets of a transcription factor with greater precision. The results from MET are produced in real time and are linked to a genome browser for easy follow-up analysis. Use of the web tool is free and open to all, and there is no login requirement. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s).",
