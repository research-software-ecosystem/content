Reliable detection of CNVs from genome sequencing data has been a strong demand for disease research. However, current software for detecting CNVs has high false-positive rates, which needs further improvement. Methods: Here, we proposed a novel and post-processing approach for CNVs prediction (CNV-P), a machine-learning framework that could efficiently remove false-positive fragments from results of CNVs detecting tools. A series of CNVs signals such as read depth (RD), split reads (SR) and read pair (RP) around the putative CNV fragments were defined as features to train a classifier. Results: The prediction results on several real biological datasets showed that our models could accurately classify the CNVs at over 90% precision rate and 85% recall rate, which greatly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, our results indicate that CNV-P is robust to different sizes of CNVs and the platforms of sequencing. Conclusions: Our framework for classifying high-confident CNVs could improve both basic research and clinical diagnosis of genetic diseases.",
