description: Vcfanno allows you to quickly annotate your VCF with any number of INFO
  fields from any number of VCFs or BED files. It uses a simple conf file to allow
  the user to specify the source annotation files and fields and how they will be
  added to the info of the query VCF. . * For VCF, values are pulled by name from
  the INFO field with special cases of ID and FILTER to pull from those VCF columns.
  * For BED, values are pulled from (1-based) column number. * For BAM, depth (count),
  "mapq" and "seq" are currently supported. . Vcfanno is written in go and it supports
  custom user-scripts written in lua. It can annotate more than 8,000 variants per
  second with 34 annotations from 9 files on a modest laptop and over 30K variants
  per second using 12 processes on a server.
