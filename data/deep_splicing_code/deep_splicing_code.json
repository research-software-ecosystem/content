    "description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DSC' | Classifying Alternative Splicing Events Using Deep Learning | Alternative splicing (AS) is the process of combining different parts of the pre-mRNA to produce diverse transcripts and eventually different protein products from a single gene. In computational biology field, researchers try to understand AS behavior and regulation using computational models known as \"Splicing Codes\". The final goal of these algorithms is to make an in-silico prediction of AS outcome from genomic sequence. Here, we develop a deep learning approach, called Deep Splicing Code (DSC), for categorizing the well-studied classes of AS namely alternatively skipped exons, alternative 5'ss, alternative 3'ss, and constitutively spliced exons based only on the sequence of the exon junctions",
