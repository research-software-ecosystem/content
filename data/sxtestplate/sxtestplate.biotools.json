                "abstract": "Background: Genotyping of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) is a fundamental technology in modern genetics. The SNPlex\u2122 mid-throughput genotyping system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) enables the multiplexed genotyping of up to 48 SNPs simultaneously in a single DNA sample. The high level of automation and the large amount of data produced in a high-throughput laboratory require advanced software tools for quality control and workflow management. Resultsl: We have developed two programs, which address two main aspects of quality control in a SNPlex\u2122 genotyping environment: GMFilter improves the analysis of SNPlex\u2122 plates by removing wells with a low overall signal intensity. It enables scientists to automatically process the raw data in a standardized way before analyzing a plate with the proprietary GeneMapper software from Applied Biosystems. SXTestPlate examines the genotype concordance of a SNPlex\u2122 test plate, which was typed with a control SNP set. This program allows for regular quality control checks of a SNPlex\u2122 genotyping platform. It is compatible to other genotyping methods as well. Conclusion: GMFilter and SXTestPlate provide a valuable tool set for laboratories engaged in genotyping based on the SNPlex\u2122 system. The programs enhance the analysis of SNPlex\u2122 plates with the GeneMapper software and enable scientists to evaluate the performance of their genotyping platform. \u00a9 2009 Teuber et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
