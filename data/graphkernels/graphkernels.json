Summary Measuring the similarity of graphs is a fundamental step in the analysis of graph-structured data, which is omnipresent in computational biology. Graph kernels have been proposed as a powerful and efficient approach to this problem of graph comparison. Here we provide graphkernels, the first R and Python graph kernel libraries including baseline kernels such as label histogram based kernels, classic graph kernels such as random walk based kernels, and the state-of-The-Art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. The core of all graph kernels is implemented in C ++ for efficiency. Using the kernel matrices computed by the package, we can easily perform tasks such as classification, regression and clustering on graph-structured samples.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Sugiyama M."}, {"name": "Ghisu M.E."}, {"name": "Llinares-Lopez F."}, {"name": "Borgwardt K."}], "date": "2018-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mahito Sugiyama", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mahito@nii.ac.jp"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:graphkernels", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/graphkernels/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sample comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3731"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A fast C++ implementation for computing various graph kernels including (1) simple kernels between vertex and/or edge label histograms, (2) graphlet kernels, (3) random walk kernels (popular baselines), and (4) the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (state-of-the-art).", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "C++", "Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "graphkernels", "additionDate": "2018-06-20T18:15:16Z", "name": "graphkernels", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/graphkernels/graphkernels.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
