Summary Measuring the similarity of graphs is a fundamental step in the analysis of graph-structured data, which is omnipresent in computational biology. Graph kernels have been proposed as a powerful and efficient approach to this problem of graph comparison. Here we provide graphkernels, the first R and Python graph kernel libraries including baseline kernels such as label histogram based kernels, classic graph kernels such as random walk based kernels, and the state-of-The-Art Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel. The core of all graph kernels is implemented in C ++ for efficiency. Using the kernel matrices computed by the package, we can easily perform tasks such as classification, regression and clustering on graph-structured samples.","authors":["Sugiyama M.","Ghisu M.E.","Llinares-Lopez F.","Borgwardt K."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx602","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Graphkernels: R and Python packages for graph comparison","year":"2018-02-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:graphkernels","biotoolsID":"graphkernels","description":"A fast C++ implementation for computing various graph kernels including (1) simple kernels between vertex and/or edge label histograms, (2) graphlet kernels, (3) random walk kernels (popular baselines), and (4) the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (state-of-the-art).","homepage":"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/graphkernels/index.html","name":"graphkernels"}}
