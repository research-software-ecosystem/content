description: For RNA sequencing count data, BADER fits a Bayesian hierarchical model.
  The algorithm returns the posterior probability of differential expression for each
  gene between two groups A and B. The joint posterior distribution of the variables
  in the model can be returned in the form of posterior samples, which can be used
  for further down-stream analyses such as gene set enrichment.
