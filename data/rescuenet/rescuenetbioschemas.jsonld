  "sc:description": "An application that uses the Self-Organizing Map neural network algorithm for codon usage anaysis and gene-prediction. In its gene prediction functionality, RescueNet can estimate multiple models of gene codon usage properties during training. This offers advantageous gene-finding performance in cases where a diverse number of codon usage patterns are displayed.",
