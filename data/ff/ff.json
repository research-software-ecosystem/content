The search is based on the comparison of the main chain backbone conformational angles (\u03c6 and \u03c6). Additionally, the queried motifs can be superimposed to find out how similar the structural fragments are, so that the information can be effectively used in molecular modeling. The engine has facilities to view the resultant superposed or individual 3D structure(s) on the client machine. The proposed web server is made freely accessible at the following URL: http:// cluster.physics.iisc.ernet.in/ff/ or http://144.16.71.148/ff/. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.",
