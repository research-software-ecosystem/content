description: Usability wrapper around snow for easier development of parallel R programs.
  This package offers e.g. extended error checks, and additional functions. All functions
  work in sequential mode, too, if no cluster is present or wished. Package is also
  designed as connector to the cluster management tool sfCluster, but can also used
  without it.
