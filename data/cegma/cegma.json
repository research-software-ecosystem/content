Obtaining a set of wellcharacterized genes is a basic requirement in the initial steps of any genome annotation process. An accurate set of genes is needed in order to learn about species-specific properties, to train gene-finding programs, and to validate automatic predictions. Unfortunately, many new genome projects lack comprehensive experimental data to derive a reliable initial set of genes. Results: In this study, we report a computational method, CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach), for building a highly reliable set of gene annotations in the absence of experimental data. We define a set of conserved protein families that occur in a wide range of eukaryotes, and present a mapping procedure that accurately identifies their exon-intron structures in a novel genomic sequence. CEGMA includes the use of profile-hidden Markov models to ensure the reliability of the gene tructures. Our procedure allows one to build an initial set of reliable gene annotations in potentially any eukaryotic genome, even those in draft stages. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 964, "authors": [{"name": "Parra G."}, {"name": "Bradnam K."}, {"name": "Korf I."}], "date": "2007-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "19042974", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Assessing the gene space in draft genomes", "abstract": "Genome sequencing projects have been initiated for a wide range of eukaryotes. A few projects have reached completion, but most exist as draft assemblies. As one of the main reasons to sequence a genome is to obtain its catalog of genes, an important question is how complete or completable the catalog is in unfinished genomes. To answer this question, we have identified a set of core eukaryotic genes (CEGs), that are extremely highly conserved and which we believe are present in low copy numbers in higher eukaryotes. From an analysis of a phylogenetically diverse set of eukaryotic genome assemblies, we found that the proportion of CEGs mapped in draft genomes provides a useful metric for describing the gene space, and complements the commonly used N50 length and x-fold coverage values. \u00a9 2008 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 280, "authors": [{"name": "Parra G."}, {"name": "Bradnam K."}, {"name": "Ning Z."}, {"name": "Keane T."}, {"name": "Korf I."}], "date": "2009-01-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "korflab@ucdavis.edu"}, {"typeRole": [], "name": "Genis Parra", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0575-2936", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cegma", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.5"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Datasets/cegma/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2429"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-16T15:06:31Z", "otherID": [], "description": "CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach) is a software for building a highly reliable set of gene annotations in the absence of experimental data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/cegma-2-4-annotate-core-genes-eukaryotic-genomes.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "cegma", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:04:37Z", "name": "CEGMA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/Datasets/cegma/#SCT2", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
