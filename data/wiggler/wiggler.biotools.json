    "description": "Produces normalized genome-wide signal coverage tracks from raw read alignment files. Allows pooling of replicate datasets while allowing for replicate and data-type specific read shifting and smoothing parameters. It can be used to generate signal density maps for ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, FAIRE-seq and MNase-seq data. Wiggler also implicitly models variability in mappability to appropriately normalize signal density and distinguish missing data from true zero signal.",

                "abstract": "The ENCODE Project has generated a wealth of experimental information mapping diverse chromatin properties in several human cell lines. Although each such data track is independently informative toward the annotation of regulatory elements, their interrelations contain much richer information for the systematic annotation of regulatory elements. To uncover these interrelations and to generate an interpretable summary of the massive datasets of the ENCODE Project, we apply unsupervised learning methodologies, converting dozens of chromatin datasets into discrete annotation maps of regulatory regions and other chromatin elements across the human genome. These methods rediscover and summarize diverse aspects of chromatin architecture, elucidate the interplay between chromatin activity and RNA transcription, and reveal that a large proportion of the genome lies in a quiescent state, even across multiple cell types. The resulting annotation of non-coding regulatory elements correlate strongly with mammalian evolutionary constraint, and provide an unbiased approach for evaluating metrics of evolutionary constraint in human. Lastly, we use the regulatory annotations to revisit previously uncharacterized disease-associated loci, resulting in focused, testable hypotheses through the lens of the chromatin landscape. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).",
