      "sc:description": "FL-QSAR is a federated learning based QSAR prototype for collaborative drug discovery. FL-QSAR is an horizontal federated-learning based QSAR framework that enables clients to simulate the scenario of n clients with and without HFL(horizontal federated-learning). FL-QSAR is also a demo framework designed to help users better understanding the workflow and the underline mechanism of applying HFL for QSAR modeling. Meanwhile, FL-QSAR can be easily extended to other deep learning algorithms for solving various drug-related learning tasks.",
