about:
  description: This package is designed for the import, quality control, analysis,
    and visualization of methylation data generated using Sequenom's MassArray platform.  The
    tools herein contain a highly detailed amplicon prediction for optimal assay design.
    Also included are quality control measures of data, such as primer dimer and bisulfite
    conversion efficiency estimation. Methylation data are calculated using the same
    algorithms contained in the EpiTyper software package.  Additionally, automatic
    SNP-detection can be used to flag potentially confounded data from specific CG
    sites.  Visualization includes barplots of methylation data as well as UCSC Genome
    Browser-compatible BED tracks.  Multiple assays can be positionally combined for
    integrated analysis.
