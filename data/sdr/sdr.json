    "description": "A GRASS tool for the Sediment Delivery Ratio mapping.\n\nThis work involves a tool implementation for evaluating Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR) in a river basin, through GRASS GIS software. The definition of a spatially distributed value of SDR is a very important task as the sediment routing can affects solid transport in stream channels, water quality degradation, and frequency increase of natural disasters such as debris flows and mudflows. For such reason the SDR evaluation, coupled with GIS approach, has been extensively used in scientific literature. Geographic information systems provide a fundamental support for a better prediction of SDR, since it can consider the space variability of factors influencing the sediment routing processes. Actually a specific GIS module to estimate the spatial variability of SDR does not exist.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'GIS' (bio.tools/gis), 'r.sdr', 'sediment', 'GRASS'",
