      "sc:description": "Firefly luciferase (FLuc) is one of the highly favored detection techniques in HTS. However, FLuc inhibitors can cause negative interference in detection, which may result in false positive signals in HTS assays. In order to prescreen FLuc inhibitor thus avoid such unnecessary false positives, we build a reliable prediction model based on a large data set. ChemFLuc is a public webserver which could be useful to flag FLuc inhibitors in large dataset.",
