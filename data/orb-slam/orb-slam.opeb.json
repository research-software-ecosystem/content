Our method extends the ORB-SLAM2 framework with the enhanced unified camera model (EUCM) as a projection function, which can be applied to catadioptric systems and wide-angle fisheye cameras. Without rectifying or cropping the input images, the proposed system can use the full area of the images even with strong distortion.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SLAM', 'monocular', 'omnidirectional cameras', 'omnidirectional'","homepage":"https://github.com/lsyads/fisheye-ORB-SLAM","name":"ORB-SLAM"}}
