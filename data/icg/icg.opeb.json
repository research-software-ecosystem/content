With current technology, social media might be the only way for ICG to gain training access support. What resources are available for ICG of older adults who survived stroke (OASS). Objective: To identify analyze types of bilingual social media resources available to ICG of OASS Methods: Facebook data was bilingually collected (Spanish), including most popular groups and pages based on search engines containing terms such as stroke, CVA, caregiver. Similar numbers of groups (35 English vs. 52 Spanish) and pages (32 English vs. 34 Spanish) were analyzed.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Diffeomorphic (IC.OUP.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ICG OASS'",
