description: The EIGENSOFT package combines functionality from the group's population
  genetics methods (Patterson et al. 2006) and their EIGENSTRAT stratification method
  (Price et al. 2006). The EIGENSTRAT method uses principal components analysis to
  explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls along continuous
  axes of variation; the resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's
  variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations
  while maximizing power to detect true associations. The EIGENSOFT package has a
  built-in plotting script and supports multiple file formats and quantitative phenotypes.
