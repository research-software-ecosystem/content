description: "The EIGENSOFT package combines functionality from the group's population\
  \ genetics methods (Patterson et al. 2006) and their EIGENSTRAT stratification method\
  \ (Price et al. 2006). The EIGENSTRAT method uses principal components analysis\
  \ to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls along continuous\
  \ axes of variation; the resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's\
  \ variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations\
  \ while maximizing power to detect true associations. The EIGENSOFT package has\
  \ a built-in plotting script and supports multiple file formats and quantitative\
  \ phenotypes.\n"
