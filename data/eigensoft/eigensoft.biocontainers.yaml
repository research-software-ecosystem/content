description: Combindes functionality from population genetics methods (patterson et
  al. 2006) and the eigenstrat correection method (price et al. 2006). the eigenstrat
  methods uses principal component analysis to model ancestry differences between
  cases and controls along continuous axes of variation. the resulting correction
  is specific to a candidate markers variation in frequency across ancestral populations,
  minimizing spurious associations while maximising power to detect true associations.
