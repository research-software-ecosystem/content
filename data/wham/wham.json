However, these next-generation sequencing methods are critically dependent on fast and sophisticated data processing methods for aligning a set of query sequences to a reference genome using rich string matching models. The focus of this work is on the design, development and evaluation of a data processing system for this crucial \"short read alignment\" problem. Our system, called WHAM, employs hash-based indexing methods and bitwise operations for sequence alignments. It allows rich match models and it is significantly faster than the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, its relative speedup over the existing method is poised to increase in the future in which read sequence lengths will increase. \u00a9 2012 ACM.", "citationCount": 12, "authors": [{"name": "Li Y."}, {"name": "Patel J.M."}, {"name": "Terrell A."}], "date": "2012-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Database Systems"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yinan Li", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yinan@cs.wisc.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:wham", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cs.wisc.edu/wham/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-12T14:53:13Z", "otherID": [], "description": "High-throughput sequence alignment tool.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "wham", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:17:03Z", "name": "WHAM", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wham/tutorial/", "note": null, "type": "General"}, {"url": "http://research.cs.wisc.edu/wham/manual/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
