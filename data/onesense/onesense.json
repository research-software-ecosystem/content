Rapid progress in single-cell analysis methods allow for exploration of cellular diversity at unprecedented depth and throughput. Visualizing and understanding these large, high-dimensional datasets poses a major analytical challenge. Mass cytometry allows for simultaneous measurement of >40 different proteins, permitting in-depth analysis of multiple aspects of cellular diversity. In this article, we present one-dimensional soli-expression by nonlinear stochastic embedding (One-SENSE), a dimensionality reduction method based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, for categorical analysis of mass cytometry data. With One-SENSE, measured parameters are grouped into predefined categories, and cells are projected onto a space composed of one dimension for each category. In contrast with higher-dimensional t-SNE, each dimension (plot axis) in One-SENSE has biological meaning that can be easily annotated with binned heat plots. We applied One-SENSE to probe relationships between categories of human T cell phenotypes and observed previously unappreciated cellular populations within an orchestrated view of immune cell diversity. The presentation of high-dimensional cytometric data using One-SENSE showed a significant improvement in distinguished T cell diversity compared with the original t-SNE algorithm and could be useful for any highdimensional dataset.", "citationCount": 28, "authors": [{"name": "Cheng Y."}, {"name": "Wong M.T."}, {"name": "Van Der Maaten L."}, {"name": "Newell E.W."}], "date": "2016-01-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Immunology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yong Kee Tan", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yongkee.t@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:onesense", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/oneSENSE.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0226"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A graphical user interface that facilitates the dimensional reduction method based on the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) algorithm, for categorical analysis of mass cytometry data.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/oneSENSE/", "note": null, "type": "Mirror"}], "biotoolsID": "onesense", "additionDate": "2018-07-24T10:30:14Z", "name": "oneSENSE", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/manuals/oneSENSE/man/oneSENSE.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
