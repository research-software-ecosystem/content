Recent data suggest that variations in TCR binding geometry may influence T cell signaling, which could help explain outliers in relationships between physical parameters such as TCR-pMHC binding affinity and T cell function. Traditionally, TCR binding geometry has been described with simple descriptors such as the crossing angle, which quantifies what has become known as the TCR's diagonal binding mode. However, these descriptors often fail to reveal distinctions in binding geometry that are apparent through visual inspection. To provide a better framework for relating TCR structure to T cell function, we developed a comprehensive system for quantifying the geometries of how TCRs bind peptide/MHC complexes. We show that our system can discern differences not clearly revealed by more common methods. As an example of its potential to impact biology, we used it to reveal differences in how TCRs bind class I and class II peptide/MHC complexes, which we show allow the TCR to maximize access to and \u201cread out\u201d the peptide antigen. We anticipate our system will be of use in not only exploring these and other details of TCR-peptide/MHC binding interactions, but also addressing questions about how TCR binding geometry relates to T cell function, as well as modeling structural properties of class I and class II TCR-peptide/MHC complexes from sequence information. The system is available at https://tcr3d.ibbr.umd.edu/tcr_com or for download as a script.",
