Simulation studies are essential for assessing the validity of EEG analysis methods and the interpretability of results. NEW METHOD:Here we present a simulation environment for generating EEG data by embedding biologically plausible signal and noise into MRI-based forward models that incorporate individual-subject variability in structure and function. RESULTS:The package includes pipelines for the evaluation and validation of EEG analysis tools for source estimation, functional connectivity, and spatial filtering. EEG dynamics can be simulated using realistic noise and signal models with user specifiable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)",
