Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Genome-wide association studies have generated over thousands of susceptibility loci for many human complex traits, and yet for most of these associations the true causal variants remain unknown. Tissue/cell type-specific prediction and prioritization of non-coding regulatory variants will facilitate the identification of causal variants and underlying pathogenic mechanisms for particular complex diseases and traits. By leveraging recent large-scale functional genomics/epigenomics data, we develop an intuitive web server, GWAS4D (http://mulinlab.tmu.edu.cn/gwas4d or http://mulinlab.org/gwas4d), that systematically evaluates GWAS signals and identifies context-specific regulatory variants. The updated web server includes six major features: (i) updates the regulatory variant prioritization method with our new algorithm; (ii) incorporates 127 tissue/cell type-specific epigenomes data; (iii) integrates motifs of 1480 transcriptional regulators from 13 public resources; (iv) uniformly processes Hi-C data and generates significant interactions at 5 kb resolution across 60 tissues/cell types; (v) adds comprehensive non-coding variant functional annotations; (vi) equips a highly interactive visualization function for SNP-target interaction. Using a GWAS fine-mapped set for 161 coronary artery disease risk loci, we demonstrate that GWAS4D is able to efficiently prioritize disease-causal regulatory variants.","authors":["Huang D.","Yi X.","Zhang S.","Zheng Z.","Wang P.","Xuan C.","Sham P.C.","Wang J.","Li M.J."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gky407","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"GWAS4D: Multidimensional analysis of context-specific regulatory variant for human complex diseases and traits","year":"2018-07-02"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gwas4d","biotoolsID":"gwas4d","description":"Systematically evaluates GWAS signals and identifies context-specific regulatory variants.
