Reconstructing a phylogenetic tree of these taxa is generally a crucial step in any evolutionary analysis. Instead of constructing genome assemblies for all taxa, annotating these assemblies, and aligning orthologous genes, many recent studies 1) directly map raw sequencing reads to a single reference sequence, 2) extract single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and 3) infer the phylogenetic tree using maximumlikelihood methods from the aligned SNP positions. However, here we show that, when using such methods to reconstruct phylogenies from sets of simulated sequences, both the exclusion of nonpolymorphic positions and the alignment to a single reference genome, introduce systematic biases and errors in phylogeny reconstruction. To address these problems, we developed a new method that combines alignments from mappings to multiple reference sequences and show that this successfully removes biases from the reconstructed phylogenies. We implemented this method as a web server named REALPHY (Reference sequence Alignment-based Phylogeny builder), which fully automates phylogenetic reconstruction from raw sequencing reads. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Bertels F.","Silander O.K.","Pachkov M.","Rainey P.B.","Van Nimwegen E."],"cit_count":104,"doi":"10.1093/molbev/msu088","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","title":"Automated reconstruction of whole-genome phylogenies from short-sequence reads","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:realphy","biotoolsID":"realphy","description":"The Reference sequence Alignment based Phylogeny builder is a free online pipeline that can infer phylogenetic trees from whole genome sequence data.
