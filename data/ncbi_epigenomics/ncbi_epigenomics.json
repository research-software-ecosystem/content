Epigenetics is the study of stable and heritable changes in gene expression that occur independently of the primary DNA sequence. Epigenetic mechanisms include post-translational modifications of histones, DNA methylation, chromatin conformation and non-coding RNAs. It has been observed that misregulation of epigenetic processes has been associated with human disease. We have constructed the new resource by selecting the subset of epigenetics-specific data from general-purpose archives, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus, and Sequence Read Archives, and then subjecting them to further review, annotation and reorganization. Raw data is processed and mapped to genomic coordinates to generate 'tracks' that are a visual representation of the data. These data tracks can be viewed using popular genome browsers or downloaded for local analysis. The Epigenomics resource also provides the user with a unique interface that allows for intuitive browsing and searching of data sets based on biological attributes. Currently, there are 69 studies, 337 samples and over 1100 data tracks from five well-studied species that are viewable and downloadable in Epigenomics. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 39, "authors": [{"name": "Fingerman I.M."}, {"name": "McDaniel L."}, {"name": "Zhang X."}, {"name": "Ratzat W."}, {"name": "Hassan T."}, {"name": "Jiang Z."}, {"name": "Cohen R.F."}, {"name": "Schuler G.D."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 2, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Gregory D.
