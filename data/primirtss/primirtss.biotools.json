For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.The R/Bioconductor package primirTSS is a fast and convenient tool that allows implementation of the analytical method to identify transcription start sites of microRNAs by integrating ChIP-seq data of H3K4me3 and Pol II. It further ensures the precision by employing the conservation score and sequence features. The tool showed a good performance when using H3K4me3 or Pol II Chip-seq data alone as input, which brings convenience to applications where multiple datasets are hard to acquire. This flexible package is provided with both R-programming interfaces as well as graphical web interfaces. Contact: jwang@nju.edu.cn",
