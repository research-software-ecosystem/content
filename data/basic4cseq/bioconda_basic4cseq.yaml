description: Basic4Cseq is an R/Bioconductor package for basic filtering, analysis
  and subsequent visualization of 4C-seq data. Virtual fragment libraries can be created
  for any BSGenome package, and filter functions for both reads and fragments and
  basic quality controls are included. Fragment data in the vicinity of the experiment's
  viewpoint can be visualized as a coverage plot based on a running median approach
  and a multi-scale contact profile.
