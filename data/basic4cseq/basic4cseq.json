Published by Oxford University Press.Basic4Cseq is an R/Bioconductor package for basic filtering, analysis and subsequent near-cis visualization of 4C-seq data. The package processes aligned 4C-seq raw data stored in binary alignment/map (BAM) format and maps the short reads to a corresponding virtual fragment library. Functions are included to create virtual fragment libraries providing chromosome position and further information on 4C-seq fragments (length and uniqueness of the fragment ends, and blindness of a fragment) for any BSGenome package. An optional filter is included for BAM files to remove invalid 4C-seq reads, and further filter functions are offered for 4C-seq fragments. Additionally, basic quality controls based on the read distribution are included. Fragment data in the vicinity of the experiment's viewpoint are visualized as coverage plot based on a running median approach and a multi-scale contact profile. Wig files or csv files of the fragment data can be exported for further analyses and visualizations of interactions with other programs.", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Walter C."}, {"name": "Schuetzmann D."}, {"name": "Rosenbauer F."}, {"name": "Dugas M."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Carolin Walter", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "carolin.walter@uni-muenster.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:basic4cseq", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.10.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Basic4Cseq.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0564"}, {"term": "Filtering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3695"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-26T14:47:47Z", "otherID": [], "description": "R/BioConductor package for basic filtering, analysis and subsequent visualization of 4C-seq data.
