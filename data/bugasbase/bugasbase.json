The Bacterial Microarray Group at St George's (B\u03bcG@S) has been at the forefront of bacterial microarray design and analysis for over a decade and while serving as a hub of a global network of microbial research groups has developed B\u03bcG@Sbase, a microbial gene expression and comparative genomic database. B\u03bcG@Sbase (http://bugs.sgul.ac.uk/ bugsbase/) is a web-browsable, expertly curated, MIAME-compliant database that stores comprehensive experimental annotation and multiple raw and analysed data formats. Consistent annotation is enabled through a structured set of web forms, which guide the user through the process following a set of best practices and controlled vocabulary. The database currently contains 86 expertly curated publicly available data sets (with a further 124 not yet published) and full annotation information for 59 bacterial microarray designs. The data can be browsed and queried using an explorer-like interface; integrating intuitive tree diagrams to present complex experimental details clearly and concisely. Furthermore the modular design of the database will provide a robust platform for integrating other data types beyond microarrays into a more Systems analysis based future. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Witney A.A."}, {"name": "Waldron D.E."}, {"name": "Brooks L.A."}, {"name": "Tyler R.H."}, {"name": "Withers M."}, {"name": "Stoker N.G."}, {"name": "Wren B.W."}, {"name": "Butcher P.D."}, {"name": "Hinds J."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Adam A.
