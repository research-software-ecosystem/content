description: 'The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such
  as finding feature overlaps and computing coverage. The utilities are largely based
  on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and SAM/BAM. Using BEDTools,
  one can develop sophisticated pipelines that answer complicated research questions
  by streaming several BEDTools together. . The groupBy utility is distributed in
  the filo package.'
