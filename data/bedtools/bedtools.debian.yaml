summary: suite of utilities for comparing genomic features
description: >
   The BEDTools utilities allow one to address common genomics tasks such as
   finding feature overlaps and computing coverage. The utilities are largely
   based on four widely-used file formats: BED, GFF/GTF, VCF, and SAM/BAM. Using
   BEDTools, one can develop sophisticated pipelines that answer complicated
   research questions by streaming several BEDTools together.
   .
   The groupBy utility is distributed in the filo package.
version: 2.29.2
