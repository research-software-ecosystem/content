description: Mutational signatures are carcinogenic exposures or aberrant cellular
  processes that can cause alterations to the genome. We created musicatk (MUtational
  SIgnature Comprehensive Analysis ToolKit) to address shortcomings in versatility
  and ease of use in other pre-existing computational tools. Although many different
  types of mutational data have been generated, current software packages do not have
  a flexible framework to allow users to mix and match different types of mutations
  in the mutational signature inference process. Musicatk enables users to count and
  combine multiple mutation types, including SBS, DBS, and indels. Musicatk calculates
  replication strand, transcription strand and combinations of these features along
  with discovery from unique and proprietary genomic feature associated with any mutation
  type. Musicatk also implements several methods for discovery of new signatures as
  well as methods to infer exposure given an existing set of signatures. Musicatk
  provides functions for visualization and downstream exploratory analysis including
  the ability to compare signatures between cohorts and find matching signatures in
  COSMIC V2 or COSMIC V3.
