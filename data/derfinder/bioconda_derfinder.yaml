description: This package provides functions for annotation-agnostic differential
  expression analysis of RNA-seq data. Two implementations of the DER Finder approach
  are included in this package (1) single base-level F-statistics and (2) DER identification
  at the expressed regions-level. The DER Finder approach can also be used to identify
  differentially bounded ChIP-seq peaks.
