Structural information is also rapidly growing, especially in the cryo Electron Microscopy area. However, in many cases, the proteomic and genomic data are spread in multiple databases and with no simple connection to structural information.In this work we present a new web platform that integrates EMDB/PDB structures and UniProt sequences with different sources of protein annotations. The application provides an interactive interface linking sequence and structure, including EM maps, presenting the different sources of information at sequence and structural level.

Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation Complementing structural information with biochemical and biomedical annotations is a powerful approach to explore the biological function of macromolecular complexes. However, currently the compilation of annotations and structural data is a feature only available for those structures that have been released as entries to the Protein Data Bank. Results To help researchers in assessing the consistency between structures and biological annotations for structural models not deposited in databases, we present 3DBIONOTES v2.0, a web application designed for the automatic annotation of biochemical and biomedical information onto macromolecular structural models determined by any experimental or computational technique.
