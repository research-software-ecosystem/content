The objective of this study is to illustrate the rationality of ranking bifurcation configuration as an independent risk factor for aneurysm rupture. Methods: Morphological features of 719 aneurysms (216 ruptured) were automatically extracted from a consecutive cohort of patients via PyRadiomics. Rupture risks and morphological features were compared between bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms, and lasso regression was applied to explore the morphological determinants for rupture in bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms",
