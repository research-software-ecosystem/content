                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2018. Summary GCPred is a webserver for the prediction of guanylyl cyclase (GC) functional centres from amino acid sequence. GCs are enzymes that generate the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine 3', 5'-monophosphate from guanosine-5'-triphosphate. A novel class of GC centres (GCCs) has been identified in complex plant proteins. Using currently available experimental data, GCPred is created to automate and facilitate the identification of similar GCCs. The server features GCC values that consider in its calculation, the physicochemical properties of amino acids constituting the GCC and the conserved amino acids within the centre. From user input amino acid sequence, the server returns a table of GCC values and graphs depicting deviations from mean values. The utility of this server is demonstrated using plant proteins and the human interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase family of proteins as example. Availability and implementation The GCPred server is available at http://gcpred.com. Supplementary informationSupplementary dataare available at Bioinformatics online.",
