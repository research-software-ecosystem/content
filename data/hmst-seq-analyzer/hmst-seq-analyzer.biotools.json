                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s)DNA methylation (5mC) and hydroxymethylation (5hmC) are chemical modifications of cytosine bases which play a crucial role in epigenetic gene regulation. However, cost, data complexity and unavailability of comprehensive analytical tools is one of the major challenges in exploring these epigenetic marks. Hydroxymethylation-and Methylation-Sensitive Tag sequencing (HMST-seq) is one of the most cost-effective techniques that enables simultaneous detection of 5mC and 5hmC at single base pair resolution. We present HMST-Seq-Analyzer as a comprehensive and robust method for performing simultaneous differential methylation analysis on 5mC and 5hmC data sets. HMST-Seq-Analyzer can detect Differentially Methylated Regions (DMRs), annotate them, give a visual overview of methylation status and also perform preliminary quality check on the data. In addition to HMST-Seq, our tool can be used on whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data sets as well. The tool is written in Python with capacity to process data in parallel and is available at (https://hmst-seq.github.io/hmst/).",
