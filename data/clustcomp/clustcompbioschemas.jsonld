  "sc:description": "This package implements several techniques for the comparison and visualisation of relationships between different clustering results. These relationships are displayed using a weighted bi-graph, in which the nodes represent the clusters and the edges connect pairs of nodes with non-empty intersection: the weight of each edge is the number of elements in that intersection and is displayed through the edge thickness.",
