  "sc:description": "Combining P-values from multiple statistical tests is common in bioinformatics. However, this procedure is non-trivial for dependent P-values. This package implements an empirical adaptation of Brown’s Method (an extension of Fisher’s Method) for combining dependent P-values which is appropriate for highly correlated data sets found in high-throughput biological experiments.",
