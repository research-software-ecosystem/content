description: "Combining P-values from multiple statistical tests is common in bioinformatics.\
  \ However, this procedure is non-trivial for dependent P-values. This package implements\
  \ an empirical adaptation of Brown\u2019s Method (an extension of Fisher\u2019s\
  \ Method) for combining dependent P-values which is appropriate for highly correlated\
  \ data sets found in high-throughput biological experiments."
