The vast amount of data and biases introduced by sequencing and/or genome mapping pose new challenges and call for effective methods and fast computer programs for statistical analysis. To systematically model ChIP-seq data, we build a dynamic signal profile for each chromosome and then model the profile using a fully Bayesian hidden Ising model. The proposed model naturally takes into account spatial dependency and global and local distributions of sequence tags. It can be used for one-sample and two-sample analyses. Through model diagnosis, the proposed method can detect falsely enriched regions caused by sequencing and/or mapping errors, which is usually not offered by the existing hypothesis-testing-based methods. The proposed method is illustrated using 3 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data sets and 2 mixed ChIP-seq data sets and compared with 4 popular and/or well-documented methods: MACS, CisGenome, BayesPeak, and SISSRs. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves equivalent or higher sensitivity and spatial resolution in detecting TF binding sites with false discovery rate at a much lower level. \u00a9 The Author 2011.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Mo Q."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Biostatistics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jonathan Cairns", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jonathan.cairns@babraham.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bayespeak", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.26.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BayesPeak.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Peak calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3222"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-30T16:15:33Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package is an implementation of the BayesPeak algorithm for peak-calling in ChIP-seq data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "bayespeak", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T14:59:51Z", "name": "BayesPeak", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BayesPeak.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
