The vast amount of data and biases introduced by sequencing and/or genome mapping pose new challenges and call for effective methods and fast computer programs for statistical analysis. To systematically model ChIP-seq data, we build a dynamic signal profile for each chromosome and then model the profile using a fully Bayesian hidden Ising model. The proposed model naturally takes into account spatial dependency and global and local distributions of sequence tags. It can be used for one-sample and two-sample analyses. Through model diagnosis, the proposed method can detect falsely enriched regions caused by sequencing and/or mapping errors, which is usually not offered by the existing hypothesis-testing-based methods. The proposed method is illustrated using 3 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq data sets and 2 mixed ChIP-seq data sets and compared with 4 popular and/or well-documented methods: MACS, CisGenome, BayesPeak, and SISSRs. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves equivalent or higher sensitivity and spatial resolution in detecting TF binding sites with false discovery rate at a much lower level. © The Author 2011.","authors":["Mo Q."],"cit_count":14,"doi":"10.1093/biostatistics/kxr029","journal":"Biostatistics","pmid":"21914728","title":"A fully Bayesian hidden Ising model for ChIP-seq data analysis","type":"Primary","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:bayespeak","biotoolsID":"bayespeak","description":"This package is an implementation of the BayesPeak algorithm for peak-calling in ChIP-seq data.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BayesPeak.html","name":"BayesPeak","version":["1.26.0"]}}
