      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Non-invasive genotyping of metastatic colorectal cancer using circulating cell free DNA | Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in plasma provides an easily accessible source of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for detecting actionable genomic alterations that can be used to guide colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment and surveillance. The goal of this study was to test the feasibility of using a traditional amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) on Ion Torrent platform to detect low-frequency alleles in ctDNA and compare it with a digital NGS assay specifically designed to detect low-frequency variants (as low as 0.1%) to provide evidence for the standard care of CRC. The study cohort consisted of 48 CRC patients for whom matched samples of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were available",
