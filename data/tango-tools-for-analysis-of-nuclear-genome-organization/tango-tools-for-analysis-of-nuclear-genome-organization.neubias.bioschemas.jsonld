  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>## About TANGO software is an open-source software for Analysis of Nuclear Genome Organization. It is composed of an ImageJ plugin for batch processing and analysis, and a R package for statistical analysis. Reference: 2528 ## Some key features - Image import uses bioimage formats. - Construction of workflow in GUI by choosing filters / segmentation strategy for - Prefiltering - Segmentation - Postfiltering - Isolated nuclei could individually be inspected, deleted from list and subjected for detailed analysis. - Uses [MCIB3D library](http://biii.info/?q=node/1945) as backend. - Basic usage is to segment nucleus, crop them to single nucleus objects, segment substructures within objects and measure their properties. - Optionally R can be connected to do detailed analysis of results. - Uses MongoDB to manage huge data set.</p>\r\n",
