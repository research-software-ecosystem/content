The database comprises of a million terminators identified in 1060 bacterial genome sequences and 798 plasmids. Users can obtain both graphic and tabular results on putative terminators based on default or user-defined parameters. The results are arranged in different tiers to facilitate retrieval, as per the specific requirements. An interactive map has been incorporated to visualize the distribution of terminators across the whole genome. Analysis of the results, both at the whole-genome level and with respect to terminators downstream of specific genes, offers insight into the prevalence of canonical and non-canonical terminators across different phyla. The data in the database reinforce the paradigm that intrinsic termination is a conserved and efficient regulatory mechanism in bacteria. Our database is freely accessible. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Mitra A.","Kesarwani A.K.","Pal D.","Nagaraja V."],"cit_count":45,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"20972211","title":"WebGeSTer DB-A transcription terminator database","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:webgester_db","biotoolsID":"webgester_db","description":"Database of intrinsic transcription terminators identified in bacterial genome sequences and plasmids.
