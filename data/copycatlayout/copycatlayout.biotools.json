LayoutSaver cloned a network layout by mapping node locations from one network to another based on node attribute values, but failed to clone view scale and location, and provided no means of identifying which nodes were successfully mapped between networks. Copycat addresses these issues and provides additional layout options. With the advent of Cytoscape Automation (packaged in Cytoscape v3.6.0), researchers can utilize the Copycat layout and its output in workflows written in their language of choice by using only a few simple REST calls. Copycat enables researchers to visually compare groups of homologous genes, generate network comparison images for publications, and quickly identify differences between similar networks at a glance without leaving their script. With a few extra REST calls, scripts can discover nodes present in one network but not in the other, which can feed into more complex analyses (e.g., modifying mismatched nodes based on new data, then re-running the layout to highlight additional network changes).",
