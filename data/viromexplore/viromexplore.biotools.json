    "description": "ViromeXplore conatains a set of bioinformatic workflows that can be used reproducibly, sequentially and interoperably between them and with other workflows. It allows multiple input types mand starting points that include raw reads, contigs, genomes, abbundance tables, phylogenies and taxonomies. ViromeXplore contains the most varied and comprehensive workflows to explore viral genes and genomes from viromes and metagenomes to date. The future aim for ViromeXplore is to continue expanding the workflows and including the most recent and efficient tools.\n\nThe workflows are implemented in Nextflow, and additionally only Docker or Singularity are needed to run ViromeXplore.",
