                "abstract": "Summary: Large volumes of data generated by high-throughput sequencing instruments present non-trivial challenges in data storage, content access and transfer. We present G-SQZ, a Huffman coding-based sequencing-reads-specific representation scheme that compresses data without altering the relative order. G-SQZ has achieved from 65% to 81% compression on benchmark datasets, and it allows selective access without scanning and decoding from start. This article focuses on describing the underlying encoding scheme and its software implementation, and a more theoretical problem of optimal compression is out of scope. The immediate practical benefits include reduced infrastructure and informatics costs in managing and analyzing large sequencing data. \u00a9 The Author 2010. Published by Oxford University Press.",
