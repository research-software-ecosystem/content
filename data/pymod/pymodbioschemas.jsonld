  "sc:description": "A simple and intuitive interface between the popular molecular graphics system PyMOL and several other tools (i.e., BLAST, ClustalW, Muscle, CEalign and MODELLER) has been developed, to show how the integration of the individual steps required for homology modelling and sequence/structure analysis within the PyMOL framework can hugely simplify these tasks. It is a new tool for the analysis and the manipulation of protein sequences and structures.",
