Searchable databases that record the impacts of chemical or genetic perturbations on the transcriptome-here referred to as 'connectivity maps'-permit discovery of such commonalities. We describe two R packages, gCMAP and gCMAPWeb, which provide a complete framework to construct and query connectivity maps assembled from user-defined collections of differential gene expression data. Microarray or RNAseq data are processed in a standardized way, and results can be interrogated using various well-established gene set enrichment methods. The packages also feature an easy-to-deploy web application that facilitates reproducible research through automatic generation of graphical and tabular reports.Availability and implementation: The gCMAP and gCMAPWeb R packages are freely available for UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X operating systems at Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \u00a9 2013 The Author .", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Sandmann T."}, {"name": "Kummerfeld S.K."}, {"name": "Gentleman R."}, {"name": "Bourgon R."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Thomas Sandmann", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sandmann.t@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gcmapweb", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.14.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/gCMAPWeb.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene-set enrichment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2436"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-01-10T04:14:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This R package provides a graphical user interface for the gCMAP package.
