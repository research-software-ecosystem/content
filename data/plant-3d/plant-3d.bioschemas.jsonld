      "sc:description": "Plant 3D is a plant phenotyping toolkit for 3D point clouds.\n\nPlant 3D (P3D) automatically extracts common phenotyping features of interest from high-resolution 3D scans of plant architectures. P3D is open-source and is bundled with a stand-alone Windows application. P3D is written in C++ using OpenGL, QT, TensorFlow, and the point cloud library (PCL). P3D can visualize and process data imported as a 3D point cloud (pcd or txt formats) or a mesh (obj format).",
