description: The ggbio package extends and specializes the grammar of graphics for
  biological data. The graphics are designed to answer common scientific questions,
  in particular those often asked of high throughput genomics data. All core Bioconductor
  data structures are supported, where appropriate. The package supports detailed
  views of particular genomic regions, as well as genome-wide overviews. Supported
  overviews include ideograms and grand linear views. High-level plots include sequence
  fragment length, edge-linked interval to data view, mismatch pileup, and several
  splicing summaries.
