  "sc:description": "This tool to detect structural variations is specifically designed to cluster short-read paired-end data into possibly overlapping predictions for deletions and insertions. It does not make any assumptions on the composition of the data, such as the number of samples, heterogeneity or polyploidy. Taking paired ends mapped to a reference genome as input, it merges mappings to clusters based on a similarity score that takes both the putative location and size of an indel into account.",
