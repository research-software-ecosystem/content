  "sc:description": "Package for fine-tuned cancer CNA association modeling. Association is measured directly at the genomic features of interest and, in the case of genes, downstream gene-set enrichment analysis can be performed thanks to novel internal processing of the data. The software opens a way to systematically scrutinize the differences in CNA distribution across tumoral phenotypes, such as those that relate to tumor type, location and progression.",
