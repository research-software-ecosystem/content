Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Non-coding RNAs, such as miRNAs and piRNAs, play critical roles in gene regulation through base-pairing interactions with their target molecules. The recent development of the crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) method has allowed scientists to map transcriptome-wide RNA–RNA interactions by identifying chimeric reads consisting of fragments from regulatory RNAs and their targets. However, analyzing CLASH data requires scientists to use advanced bioinformatics, and currently available tools are limited for users with little bioinformatic experience. In addition, many published CLASH studies do not show the full scope of RNA–RNA interactions that were captured, highlighting the importance of reanalyzing published data. Here, we present CLASH Analyst, a web server that can analyze raw CLASH data within a fully customizable and easy-to-use interface. CLASH Analyst accepts raw CLASH data as input and identifies the RNA chimeras containing the regulatory and target RNAs according to the user’s interest. Detailed annotation of the captured RNA–RNA interactions is then presented for the user to visualize within the server or download for further analysis. We demonstrate that CLASH Analyst can identify miRNA-and piRNA-targeting sites reported from published CLASH data and should be applicable to analyze other RNA–RNA interactions. CLASH Analyst is freely available for academic use.",
