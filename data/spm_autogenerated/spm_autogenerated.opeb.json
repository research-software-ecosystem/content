The input is the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) matrix with rows corresponding to samples and columns indicating somatic genetic variants for which CCF values are measured. The output consists of a partitioning samples into subtypes, a partitioning of variants into pathways, and a linear progression model of the pathways for each subtype.\n\nOur software SPM consists of three separate parts: intermediate file generation (matGenerator.cpp), the main algorithm implementation (SPM.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
