Gathering together this range of data into a single resource allows the investigation of how novel enzyme functions have evolved within a structurally defined superfamily as well as providing a means to analyse trends across many superfamilies. This is done not only within the context of an enzyme's sequence and structure but also the relationships of their reactions. Developed in tandem with the CATH database, it currently comprises 276 superfamilies covering \u223c1800 (70%) of sequence assigned enzyme reactions. Central to the resource are phylogenetic trees generated from structurally informed multiple sequence alignments using both domain structural alignments supplemented with domain sequences and whole sequence alignments based on commonality of multi-domain architectures. These trees are decorated with functional annotations such as metabolite similarity as well as annotations from manually curated resources such the catalytic site atlas and MACiE for enzyme mechanisms. The resource is freely available through a web interface: www.ebi.ac.uk/thorton-srv/databases/FunTree. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.", "citationCount": 29, "authors": [{"name": "Furnham N."}, {"name": "Sillitoe I."}, {"name": "Holliday G.L."}, {"name": "Cuff A.L."}, {"name": "Rahman S.A."}, {"name": "Laskowski R.A."}, {"name": "Orengo C.A."}, {"name": "Thornton J.M."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Contact Form", "url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:funtree", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/FunTree/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Tree-based sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0499"}, {"term": "Phylogenetic tree generation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0323"}, {"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}, {"term": "Multiple structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0504"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Provides a range of data resources to detect the evolution of enzyme function within distant structurally related clusters within domain super families as determined by CATH.", "toolType": ["Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "funtree", "additionDate": "2017-03-30T23:00:54Z", "name": "FunTree", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use", "note": null, "type": "Terms of use"}, {"url": "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/FunTree/templates/CathDisplayHlp.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
