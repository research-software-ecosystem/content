The principal novelties of MitoZoa are extensive corrections/improvements of the mtDNA annotations and the possibility of easily searching for data on: (1) gene order, a genomic feature useful as phylogenetic marker; (2) sequence, size and location of non-coding regions, likely containing the regulatory signals for mtDNA replication and transcription; (3) mt features/sequences of congeneric species, where saturation phenomena in nucleotide substitutions and gene order changes are expected to be absent or at least minimal. In addition, MitoZoa allows the exploration of basic mt features such as molecule topology, genetic code, gene content, and compositional parameters of the entire genome. Finally, in order to facilitate downstream analyses of retrieved data, MitoZoa entry lists can be visualized and downloaded in a tabular format, while sequences and gene order data are provided in FASTA and FASTA-like formats, respectively.
