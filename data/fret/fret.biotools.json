                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, Springer Nature America, Inc.The applications of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) grow with each year. However, different FRET techniques are not applied consistently, nor are results uniformly presented, which makes implementing and reproducing FRET experiments challenging. We discuss important considerations for designing and evaluating ensemble FRET experiments. Alongside a primer on FRET basics, we provide guidelines for making experimental design choices such as the donor-acceptor pair, instrumentation and labeling chemistries; selecting control experiments to unambiguously demonstrate FRET and validate that the experiments provide meaningful data about the biomolecular process in question; analyzing raw data and assessing the results; and reporting data and experimental details in a manner that easily allows for reproducibility. Some considerations are also given for FRET assays and FRET imaging, especially with fluorescent proteins. Our goal is to motivate and empower all biologists to consider FRET for the powerful research tool it can be.",
