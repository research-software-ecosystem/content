Here, we designed a web knowledgebase, the Signaling Pathways Project (SPP), which incorporates community classifications of signaling pathway nodes (receptors, enzymes, transcription factors and co-nodes) and their cognate bioactive small molecules. We then mapped over 10,000 public transcriptomic or cistromic experiments to their pathway node or biosample of study. To enable prediction of pathway node-gene target transcriptional regulatory relationships through SPP, we generated consensus \u2018omics signatures, or consensomes, which ranked genes based on measures of their significant differential expression or promoter occupancy across transcriptomic or cistromic experiments mapped to a specific node family. Consensomes were validated using alignment with canonical literature knowledge, gene target-level integration of transcriptomic and cistromic data points, and in bench experiments confirming previously uncharacterized node-gene target regulatory relationships. To expose the SPP knowledgebase to researchers, a web browser interface was designed that accommodates numerous routine data mining strategies. SPP is freely accessible at https://www.signalingpathways.org.",
