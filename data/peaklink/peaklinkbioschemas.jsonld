  "sc:description": "Uses information in both the time and frequency domain as inputs to a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The PL algorithm first  removes candidate corresponding peaks with excessively large elution time shifts, then calculates the correlation between a pair of candidate peaks after removing noise. Then a SVM classifier is trained and applied for differentiating corresponding and non-corresponding peptide peaks.",
