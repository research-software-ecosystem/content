New technologies are revolutionising biological research and its applications by making it easier and cheaper to generate ever-greater volumes and types of data. In response, the services and infrastructure of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, www.ebi.ac.UK) are continually expanding: total disk capacity increases significantly every year to keep pace with demand (75 petabytes as of December 2015), and interoperability between resources remains a strategic priority. Since 2014 we have launched two new resources: the European Variation Archive for genetic variation data and EMPIAR for two-dimensional electron microscopy data, as well as a Resource Description Framework platform. We also launched the Embassy Cloud service, which allows users to run large analyses in a virtual environment next to EMBL-EBI's vast public data resources.","authors":["Cook C.E.","Bergman M.T.","Finn R.D.","Cochrane G.","Birney E.","Apweiler R."],"cit_count":48,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkv1352","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"The European Bioinformatics Institute in 2016: Data growth and integration","type":"Other","year":"2016-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pepinfo-ebi","biotoolsID":"pepinfo-ebi","description":"Plot amino acid properties of a protein sequence in parallel.","homepage":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/seqstats/emboss_pepinfo/","name":"pepinfo (EBI)","version":["1"]}}
