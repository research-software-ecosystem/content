  "sc:description": "Powerful method to control Type-I error inflation in partially sequenced data for rare variant association testing. It is typically used to combine sequence and genotype data for the two stage design, in which individuals sequenced in stage one for variant detection are solely or predominantly cases then in stage two the discovered variants are genotyped in the remaining individuals. It can work with any existing rare variant association methods that use genotypes or imputed genotypes as input.",
