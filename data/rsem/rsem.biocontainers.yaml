description: We present a generative statistical model and associated inference methods
  that handle read mapping uncertainty in a principled manner. through simulations
  parameterized by real rnaseq data, we show that our method is more accurate than
  previous methods. our improved accuracy is the result ofhandling read mapping uncertainty
  with a statistical model and the estimationof gene expression levels as the sum
  of isoform expression levels.
