summary: Nucleic acid sequence assembler for very short reads
description: >
   Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
   sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by Daniel Zerbino and
   Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), near
   Cambridge, in the United Kingdom.
   .
   Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces
   high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired read information, if
   available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
version: 1.2.10
