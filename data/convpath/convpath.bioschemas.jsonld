      "sc:description": "A software tool for lung adenocarcinoma digital pathological image analysis aided by a convolutional neural network.\n\nBACKGROUND:The spatial distributions of different types of cells could reveal a cancer cell's growth pattern, its relationships with the tumor microenvironment and the immune response of the body, all of which represent key \"hallmarks of cancer\". However, the process by which pathologists manually recognize and localize all the cells in pathology slides is extremely labor intensive and error prone. METHODS:In this study, we developed an automated cell type classification pipeline, ConvPath, which includes nuclei segmentation, convolutional neural network-based tumor cell, stromal cell, and lymphocyte classification, and extraction of tumor microenvironment-related features for lung cancer pathology images.",
