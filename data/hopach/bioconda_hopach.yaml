description: The HOPACH clustering algorithm builds a hierarchical tree of clusters
  by recursively partitioning a data set, while ordering and possibly collapsing clusters
  at each level. The algorithm uses the Mean/Median Split Silhouette (MSS) criteria
  to identify the level of the tree with maximally homogeneous clusters. It also runs
  the tree down to produce a final ordered list of the elements. The non-parametric
  bootstrap allows one to estimate the probability that each element belongs to each
  cluster (fuzzy clustering).
