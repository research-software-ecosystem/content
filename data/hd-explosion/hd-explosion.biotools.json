For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: Hydrogen-Deuterium eXchange coupled to mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for the analysis of protein dynamics and interactions. Bottom-up experiments looking at deuterium uptake differences between various conditions are the most common. These produce multi-dimensional data that can be challenging to depict in a single visual format. Each user must also set significance thresholds to define meaningful differences and make these apparent in data presentation. To assist in this process, we have created HD-eXplosion, an open-source, web-based application for the generation of chiclet and volcano plots with statistical filters. HD-eXplosion fills a void in available software packages and produces customizable plots that are publication quality.",
