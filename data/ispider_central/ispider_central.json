To address this, we present the ISPIDER Central Proteomic Database search (http://www.ispider.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ProteomicSearch.pl), an integration service offering novel search capabilities over leading, mature, proteomic repositories including PRoteomics IDEntifications database (PRIDE), PepSeeker, PeptideAtlas and the Global Proteome Machine. It enables users to search for proteins and peptides that have been characterised in mass spectrometry-based proteomics experiments from different groups, stored in different databases, and view the collated results with specialist viewers/clients. In order to overcome limitations imposed by the great variability in protein accessions used by individual laboratories, the European Bioinformatics Institute's Protein Identifier Cross-Reference (PICR) service is used to resolve accessions from different sequence repositories. Custom-built clients allow users to view peptide/protein identifications in different contexts from multiple experiments and repositories, as well as integration with the Dasty2 client supporting any annotations available from Distributed Annotation System servers. Further information on the protein hits may also be added via external web services able to take a protein as input. This web server offers the first truly integrated access to proteomics repositories and provides a unique service to biologists interested in mass spectrometry-based proteomics.", "citationCount": 12, "authors": [{"name": "Siepen J.A."}, {"name": "Belhajjame K."}, {"name": "Selley J.N."}, {"name": "Embury S.M."}, {"name": "Paton N.W."}, {"name": "Goble C.A."}, {"name": "Oliver S.G."}, {"name": "Stevens R."}, {"name": "Zamboulis L."}, {"name": "Martin N."}, {"name": "Poulovassillis A."}, {"name": "Jones P."}, {"name": "Cote R."}, {"name": "Hermjakob H."}, {"name": "Pentony M.M."}, {"name": "Jones D.T."}, {"name": "Orengo C.A."}, {"name": "Hubbard S.J."}], "date": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ispider_central", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ispider.manchester.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ProteomicSearch.pl", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "Data retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"}, {"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:20:39Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Provides a range of services for integrative data analysis in mass spectrometry-based proteomics.
