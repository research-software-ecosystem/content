  "sc:description": "Uses NCBI Blast to align nucleotide sequences that have large indels or are difficult to align globally. It selects the most representative sequence from the input sequences and then extracts the blast query anchored multiple alignment. Alternatively, the user can choose which sequence to use as an anchor. It also outputs a matrix representing regions of homology along the sequences.",
