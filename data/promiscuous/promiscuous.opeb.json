Accidental findings regarding multispecificity of approved drugs led to block-busters in new indication areas. Therefore, the interest in systematically elucidating new areas of application for known drugs is rising. Furthermore, the knowledge, understanding and prediction of so-calledoff-target effects allow a rational approach to the understanding of side-effects. With PROMISCUOUS we provide an exhaustive set of drugs (25 000), including withdrawn or experimental drugs, annotated with drug-protein and protein-protein relationships (21 500/104 000) compiled from public resources via text and data mining including manual curation. Measures of structural similarity for drugs as well as known side-effects can be easily connected to protein-protein interactions to establish and analyse networks responsible for multi-pharmacology. This network-based approach can provide a starting point for drug-repositioning. PROMISCUOUS is publicly available at http://bioinformatics.charite.de/ promiscuous. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Von Eichborn J.","Murgueitio M.S.","Dunkel M.","Koerner S.","Bourne P.E.","Preissner R."],"cit_count":132,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21071407","title":"PROMISCUOUS: A database for network-based drug-repositioning","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:promiscuous","biotoolsID":"promiscuous","description":"PROMISCUOUS is a database of drugs, including withdrawn or experimental drugs, annotated with drug-protein and protein-protein relationships compiled from public resources via text and data mining including manual curation.
