description: Strand specific peak-pair calling in ChIP-exo replicates. The cumulative
  Skellam distribution function is used to detect significant normalised count differences
  of opposed sign at each DNA strand (peak-pairs). Then, irreproducible discovery
  rate for overlapping peak-pairs across biological replicates is computed.
