  description: mass-spectrometry database search tool
  long_description: " Inspect is a MS/MS database search tool specifically designed
    to address\n two crucial needs of the proteomics comminuty: post-translational\n\
    \ modification identification and search speed. The program is available\n as
    a free download or online in the ProteoSAFe webserver. The online\n interface
    is coordinated with other proteomics software developed in the\n lab, like PepNovo\n\
    \ .\n Typical database searches do not deal well with the dynamic nature of\n\
    \ the proteome. Post-translational modifications, alternative splicing,\n and
    laboratory chemisty all affect protein behavior and make spectrum\n interpretation
    more challenging. The primary challenge is that the\n \"virtual database\" of
    all modified peptides undergoes a combinatorial\n explosion when a broad range
    of modifications is allowed. This affects\n search running time. A secondary challenge
    is that in this richer\n database, there are many more close \"relatives\" for
    each peptide. This\n affects scoring accuracy, since differentiating between correct
    and\n incorrect identifications is more difficult.\n .\n InsPecT addresses several
    algorithmic problems in order to identify\n modified proteins.\n .\n InsPecT uses
    peptide sequence tags (PSTs) to filter the database.\n InsPecT has an internal
    tag generator, but can accept tags generated by\n other tools (e.g. Pepnovo, GutenTAG).
    Because de novo is imperfect,\n multiple tags are produced for each spectrum,
    to ensure that (at least)\n one tag is corrrect. These PSTs are extremely efficient
    filters, even in\n the context of up to a dozen possible modifications. Tag-based
    filtering\n can also be combined with the \"two-pass\" filtering pioneered by\n\
    \ X!Tandem, where from one search provides a list of proteins (a mini-\n database)
    for a more detailed search.\n .\n Unanticipated modifications are common in proteomics.
    InsPecT implements\n the MS-Alignment algorithm for \"blind\" spectral search,
    with no bias\n toward anticipated modification types. This search has been applied
    to\n annotate heavily-modified proteins such as crystallins."
