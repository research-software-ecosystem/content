                "abstract": "Reliable identification of posttranslational modifications is key to understanding various cellular regulatory processes. We describe a tool, InsPecT, to identify posttranslational modifications using tandem mass spectrometry data. InsPecT constructs database filters that proved to be very successful in genomics searches. Given an MS/MS spectrum S and a database D, a database filter selects a small fraction of database D that is guaranteed (with high probability) to contain a peptide that produced S. InsPecT uses peptide sequence tags as efficient filters that reduce the size of the database by a few orders of magnitude while retaining the correct peptide with very high probability. In addition to filtering, InsPecT also uses novel algorithms for scoring and validating in the presence of modifications, without explicit enumeration of all variants. InsPecT identifies modified peptides with better or equivalent accuracy than other database search tools while being 2 orders of magnitude faster than SEQUEST, and substantially faster than X!TANDEM on complex mixtures. The tool was used to identify a number of novel modifications in different data sets, including many phosphopetides in data provided by Alliance for Cellular Signaling that were missed by other tools. © 2005 American Chemical Society.",

                "abstract": "Filtration techniques in the form of rapid elimination of candidate sequences while retaining the true one are key ingredients of database searches in genomics. Although SEQUEST and Mascot perform a conceptually similar task to the tool BLAST, the key algorithmic idea of BLAST (filtration) was never implemented in these tools. As a result MS/MS protein identification tools are becoming too time-consuming for many applications including search for post-translationally modified peptides. Moreover, matching millions of spectra against all known proteins will soon make these tools too slow in the same way that \"genome vs genome\" comparisons instantly made BLAST too slow. We describe the development of filters for MS/MS database searches that dramatically reduce the running time and effectively remove the bottlenecks in searching the huge space of protein modifications. Our approach, based on a probability model for determining the accuracy of sequence tags, achieves superior results compared to GutenTag, a popular tag generation algorithm.
