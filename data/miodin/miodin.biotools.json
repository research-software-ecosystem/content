It is widely recognized that integrative omics analysis holds the promise to unlock novel and actionable biological insights into health and disease. Integration of multi-omics data remains challenging, however, and requires combination of several software tools and extensive technical expertise to account for the properties of heterogeneous data. Results: This paper presents the miodin R package, which provides a streamlined workflow-based syntax for multi-omics data analysis. The package allows users to perform analysis of omics data either across experiments on the same samples (vertical integration), or across studies on the same variables (horizontal integration). Workflows have been designed to promote transparent data analysis and reduce the technical expertise required to perform low-level data import and processing. Conclusions: The miodin package is implemented in R and is freely available for use and extension under the GPL-3 license.
