    "description": "consensus approach to contig filtering and genome prediction from single cell sequencing libraries of uncultured eukaryotes.\n\nSCGid, a consensus approach to contig filtering and genome prediction from single-cell sequencing libraries.\n\nPlease note that this version of SCGid constitutes an early-release version that is currently under active development toward a stable version coinciding with the release of the accepted manuscript introduing it. I am now porting SCGid to python 3 and stabilizing it for full release as SCGid (v1.0) within the next few weeks. This development is taking place on a separate branch. In the mean time, this beta version is working and available for use. I am available to assist with any problems you run into while using this branch of SCGid as well as patch bugs. If you encounter a bug or confusing error while running the beta version of SCGid, please open an issue on this repositiory",
