description: "Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on\
  \ a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum\
  \ mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering\
  \ and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of >50 in\
  \ mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 \xD7 76 bp paired-end\
  \ reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment\
  \ sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical\
  \ junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts,\
  \ and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing\
  \ of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, the authors experimentally\
  \ validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90% success rate,\
  \ corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy."
