      "sc:description": "CellRank is a package for mapping the fate of single cells in diverse scenarios, including perturbations such as regeneration or disease, for which direction is unknown. The approach combines the robustness of trajectory inference with directional information from RNA velocity, derived from ratios of spliced to unspliced reads. CellRank takes into account both the gradual and stochastic nature of cellular fate decisions, as well as uncertainty in RNA velocity vectors",
