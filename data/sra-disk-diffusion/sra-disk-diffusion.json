MIC determinations of 40 clinical isolates of C. difficile were performed with the E-test. The disk diffusion test was standardized according to the Swedish Reference Group for Antibiotics (SRGA). Disks used for SRA contained 1.5, 5, 15, 50 and 150 \u03bcg fusidic acid and the routine disk contained 50 \u03bcg fusidic acid. A control strain, ATCC 9689, was also tested. SRA constants A and B of the regression lines were calculated. This permitted the determination of zone breakpoints for C. difficile. When applying the pharmacological MIC S and R limits set by SRGA to the E-test results 1 strain of C. difficile was interpreted as resistant. Zone breakpoints corresponding to the pharmacological MIC limits and calculated using the mean SRA constants for the 40 clinical isolates lead to all strains being interpreted as susceptible. SRA calculations enable laboratories to set up calibrated disk tests with species-related and laboratory-specific interpretations.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Oppenheimer M."}, {"name": "Kronvall G."}, {"name": "Karlsson I."}, {"name": "Holst E."}], "date": "2000-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://ki.se/en/labmed/christian-giske-group#header-3", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Christian.Giske@ki.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sra-disk-diffusion", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://ki.se/en/labmed/christian-giske-group#header-3", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Regression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3659"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A methodological innovation for calibration of the disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility test.It is also a method suitable for analysis of different disk potencies of new antibiotics.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/sra-2-0b-single-strain-regression-analysis.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "sra-disk-diffusion", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:00:30Z", "name": "SRA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://ki.se/en/labmed/christian-giske-group#header-3", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
