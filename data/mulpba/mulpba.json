Indeed, multiple structural alignments are essential for the analysis of function, evolution and architecture of protein structures. For this purpose, we proposed a new web server called multiple Protein Block Alignment (mulPBA). This server implements a method based on a structural alphabet to describe the backbone conformation of a protein chain in terms of dihedral angles. This sequence-like representation enables the use of powerful sequence alignment methods for primary structure comparison, followed by an iterative refinement of the structural superposition. This approach yields alignments superior to most of the rigid-body alignment methods and highly comparable with the flexible structure comparison approaches. We implement this method in a web server designed to do multiple structure superimpositions from a set of structures given by the user. Outputs are given as both sequence alignment and superposed 3D structures visualized directly by static images generated by PyMol or through a Jmol applet allowing dynamic interaction. Multiple global quality measures are given. Relatedness between structures is indicated by a distance dendogram. Superimposed structures in PDB format can be also downloaded, and the results are quickly obtained. mulPBA server can be accessed at www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb-tools/mulpba/. \u00a9 2013 Taylor & Francis.", "citationCount": 13, "authors": [{"name": "Leonard S."}, {"name": "Joseph A.P."}, {"name": "Srinivasan N."}, {"name": "Gelly J.-C."}, {"name": "De Brevern A.G."}], "date": "2014-04-03T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Sylvain L\u00e9onard", "url": "http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/lang/en", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sylvain.leonard@inserm.fr"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Agnel Praveen Joseph", "url": "http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/mulpba/contact.php", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "agnelibt@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mulpba", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/mulpba/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0295"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An efficient tool for comparison of protein structures based on similarity in the local backbone conformation.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mulpba-multiple-protein-structure-alignment.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mulpba", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:51:56Z", "name": "MulPBA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/mulpba/about.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
