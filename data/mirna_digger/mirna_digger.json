All rights reserved. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression. The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technique have greatly facilitated large-scale detection of the miRNAs. However, thoroughly discovery of novel miRNAs from the available HTS data sets remains a major challenge. In this study, we observed that Dicer-mediated cleavage sites for the processing of the miRNA precursors could be mapped by using degradome sequencing data in both animals and plants. In this regard, a novel tool, miRNA Digger, was developed for systematical discovery of miRNA candidates through genome-wide screening of cleavage signals based on degradome sequencing data. To test its sensitivity and reliability, miRNA Digger was applied to discover miRNAs from four organs of Arabidopsis. The results revealed that a majority of already known mature miRNAs along with their miRNA\u2217s expressed in these four organs were successfully recovered. Notably, a total of 30 novel miRNA-miRNA\u2217 pairs that have not been registered in miRBase were discovered by miRNA Digger. After target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, eleven miRNA-target interactions involving six of the novel miRNAs were identified. Taken together, miRNA Digger could be applied for sensitive detection of novel miRNAs and it could be freely downloaded from http://www.bioinfolab.cn/miRNA-Digger/index.html.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Yu L."}, {"name": "Shao C."}, {"name": "Ye X."}, {"name": "Meng Y."}, {"name": "Zhou Y."}, {"name": "Chen M."}], "date": "2016-01-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Scientific Reports"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.bioinfolab.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mirna_digger", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bioinfolab.cn/miRNA_Digger/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Pipeline for large-scale identifiction of the new microRNA genes by screening the cleavage signals resided within the genome.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C#"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mirna-digger-genome-wide-novel-mirna-mining.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mirna_digger", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:07:03Z", "name": "miRNA Digger", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.bioinfolab.cn/miRNA_Digger/index.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
