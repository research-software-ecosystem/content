Recent studies have highlighted the important roles of APA in human. However, APA profiles in other animals have not been fully recognized, and there is no database that provides comprehensive APA information for other animals except human.",

Recent studies have highlighted the important roles of APA in human. However, APA profiles in other animals have not been fully recognized, and there is no database that provides comprehensive APA information for other animals except human. Here, by using the RNA sequencing data collected from public databases, we systematically characterized the APA profiles in 9244 samples of 18 species. In total, we identified 342 952 APA events with a median of 17 020 per species using the DaPars2 algorithm, and 315 691 APA events with a median of 17 953 per species using the QAPA algorithm in these 18 species, respectively. In addition, we predicted the polyadenylation sites (PAS) and motifs near PAS of these species. We further developed Animal-APAdb, a user-friendly database (http://gong lab.hzau.edu. cn/Animal-APAdb/) for data searching, browsing and downloading. With comprehensive information of APA events in different tissues of different species, Animal-APAdb may greatly facilitate the exploration of animal APA patterns and novel mechanisms, gene expression regulation and APA evolution across tissues and species.",
