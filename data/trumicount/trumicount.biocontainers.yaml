description: For ngs experiments using unique molecular identifiers (umis), molecules
  that are lost entirely during sequencing cause under- estimation of the molecule
  count, and amplification artifacts like pcr chimeras cause over-estimation. trumicount
  corrects umi data for both types of errors, thus improving the accuracy of measured
  molecule counts considerably.
