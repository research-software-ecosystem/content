    "description": "AltAnalyze is a comprehensive tool for the analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing data from RNA-seq and Affymetrix (exon, gene, junction) datasets at the level of proteins, domains, microRNA binding sites and pathways. The Cytoscape plugin DomainGraph (www.domaingraph.de) allows for visualization of AltAnalyze results at multiple levels of abstraction (e.g., isoform, exon, protein, domain, molecular interactions).",

                "abstract": "Alternative splicing is an important mechanism for increasing protein diversity. However, its functional effects are largely unknown. Here, we present our new software workflow composed of the open-source application AltAnalyze and the Cytoscape plugin DomainGraph. Both programs provide an intuitive and comprehensive end-to-end solution for the analysis and visualization of alternative splicing data from Affymetrix Exon and Gene Arrays at the level of proteins, domains, microRNA binding sites, molecular interactions and pathways. Our software tools include easy-to-use graphical user interfaces, rigorous statistical methods (FIRMA, MiDAS and DABG filtering) and do not require prior knowledge of exon array analysis or programming. They provide new methods for automatic interpretation and visualization of the effects of alternative exon inclusion on protein domain composition and microRNA binding sites. These data can be visualized together with affected pathways and gene or protein interaction networks, allowing a straightforward identification of potential biologic-al effects due to alternative splicing at different levels of granularity. Our programs are available at http://www.altanalyze.org and http://www. domaingraph.de. These websites also include extensive documentation, tutorials and sample data. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.
