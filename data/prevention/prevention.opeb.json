Venous phlebotomy is challenging for busy or resource-constrained patients. In this paper, we introduce the first-ever quantitative diagnostic test based on menstrual fluid, which allows HbA1c quantification from self-collected mailed tampons. We demonstrate that menstrual HbA1c is comparable to venous HbA1c in the diagnosis of prediabetes with the standard threshold of 5.7. We also demonstrate accuracy, precision, stability, and interference testing","homepage":"https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/prevention/pdf/","name":"prevention"}}
