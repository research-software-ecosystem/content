It consists of a collection of expert-curated protein family signatures and rules that specify annotations that apply to family members. HAMAP was originally developed by the Swiss-Prot group to help curators annotate UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records and was subsequently made available to external users via the HAMAP-Scan web service. HAMAP signatures are also integrated into InterPro and the HAMAP rules into UniRule, the core part of the UniProt automatic annotation pipeline.",
