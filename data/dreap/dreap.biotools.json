    "description": "A user-friendly program for the analyses of radiation-induced biological responses utilizing established deterministic models at cell population and organ scales | PURPOSE:To develop a user-friendly program for biological modeling to analyze radiation-induced responses at the scales of the cell population and organ. METHODS:The program offers five established cell population surviving fraction (SF) models to estimate the SF and the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) from clonogenic assay data, and two established models to calculate the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) and tumor control probability (TCP) from radiation treatment plans. Users can also verify the results with multiple types of quantitative analyses and graphical representation tools",
