      "sc:description": "An R package for computing network perturbation amplitudes using gene expression data and two-layer networks | NPA - Network Perturbation Amplitude | R package and data for NPA models | The NPA (Network Perturbation Amplitude) and BIF (Biological Impact Factor) methods allow to understand the mechanisms behind and predict the effect of exposure based on transcriptomics datasets.This approach enables to translate the gene expression fold-changes into differential values for each network node, and to summarize this at the network level to provide aquantitative assessment of the degree of perturbation of the network model, the Network Perturbation Amplitude (NPA).Combining multiple relevant network models, the overall biological impact of a perturbing agent, the Biological Impact Factor (BIF),can be calculated by aggregating individual NPA scores | After package installation, networks are installed with no precomputed data",
