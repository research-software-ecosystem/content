The generalized Waring regression model for count data explains that inherent variability is given by three possible sources: randomness, liability and proneness. The model extends the negative binomial regression model and it is not included in the family of generalized linear models. In order to avoid that shortcoming, we developed the GWRM R package for fitting, describing and validating the model. The version we introduce in this communication provides a new design of the modelling function as well as new methods operating on the associated fitted model objects, so that the new software integrates easily into the computational toolbox for modelling count data in R. The release of a plug-in in order to use the package from the interface R Commander tries to contribute to the spreading of the model among non-advanced users. We illustrate the usage and the possibilities of the software with two examples from the fields of health and sport. Copyright:",
