  "sc:description": "Designed to test multiple hypotheses and control either the false discovery rate or the family-wise error rate. The method facilitates the input of prior information in the form of groupings of tests, for example, one group might include SNPs in candidate genes, while another includes all other SNPS. For each group a weight is estimated from the observed test statistics within the group.",
