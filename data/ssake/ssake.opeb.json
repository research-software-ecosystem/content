The instrument now available from Solexa Ltd, produces millions of short DNA sequences of 25 nt each. Due to ubiquitous repeats in large genomes and the inability of short sequences to uniquely and unambiguously characterize them, the short read length limits applicability for de novo sequencing. However, given the sequencing depth and the throughput of this instrument, stringent assembly of highly identical sequences can be achieved. We describe SSAKE, a tool for aggressively assembling millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching through a prefix tree for the longest possible overlap between any two sequences. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from short sequence reads by stringently assembling them into contiguous sequences that can be used to characterize novel sequencing targets. © 2007 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Warren R.L.","Sutton G.G.","Jones S.J.M.","Holt R.A."],"cit_count":298,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"17158514","title":"Assembling millions of short DNA sequences using SSAKE","year":"2007-02-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ssake","biotoolsID":"ssake","description":"A program for assemblying short DNA sequences.
