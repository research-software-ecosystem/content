Published by Oxford University Press. Summary: We have developed an algorithm for genetic analysis of complex traits using genome-wide SNPs in a linear mixed model framework. Compared to current standard REML software based on the mixed model equation, our method is substantially faster. The advantage is largest when there is only a single genetic covariance structure. The method is particularly useful for multivariate analysis, including multi-trait models and random regression models for studying reaction norms. We applied our proposed method to publicly available mice and human data and discuss the advantages and limitations.","authors":["Lee S.H.","Van Der Werf J.H.J."],"cit_count":22,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26755623","title":"MTG2: An efficient algorithm for multivariate linear mixed model analysis based on genomic information","year":"2016-05-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mtg2","biotoolsID":"mtg2","description":"Computer program to provide Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimates for genetic and environmental variance and covariance across multiple traits.","homepage":"https://sites.google.com/site/honglee0707/mtg2","name":"MTG2"}}
