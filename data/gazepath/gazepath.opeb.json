This package provides a non-parametric speed-based approach to do this on a trial basis. The method is especially useful when there are large differences in data quality, as the thresholds are adjusted accordingly.","homepage":"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gazepath/index.html","name":"Gazepath","version":["1.2"]}}
