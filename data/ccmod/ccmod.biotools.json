    "description": "A GATE module for Compton Camera imaging simulation.\n\nCompton cameras are gamma-ray imaging systems which have been proposed for a wide variety of applications such as medical imaging, nuclear decommissioning or homeland security. In the design and optimization of such a system Monte Carlo simulations play an essential role. In this work, we propose a generic module to perform Monte Carlo simulations and analyses of Compton Camera imaging which is included in the open-source GATE Geant4 platform. Several digitization stages have been implemented within the module to mimic the performance of the most commonly employed detectors (e.g. monolithic blocks, pixelated scintillator crystals, strip detectors...).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Compton', 'Compton Camera', 'scintillator'",
