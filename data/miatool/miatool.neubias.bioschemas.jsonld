  "http://schema.org/description": "The Microscopy Image Analysis Tool (MIATool) is a software application designed for the viewing and processing of N-dimensional array of images. At its core is an image viewer which allows the traversal of an N-dimensional array of images. Besides the standard display as pixels of varying intensity values, options are available to view the images as mesh or contour plots. The current version of MIATool supports four different image editing tools which can be used to process the images displayed in the viewer. The intensity adjustment tool provides different ways to modify the pixel intensity values, and the crop tool allows trimming of the images to retain only the portion that is of interest. The two remaining tools - the segmentation tool and the label tool - can be used for manual image segmentation and image labeling.",
