An important aspect in the development of such models is the implementation of bespoke inference methodologies, a process which can become quite laborious, when multiple candidate models are being considered. We describe automatic, black-box inference in such models using Stan, a popular probabilistic programming language. The utilization of systems like Stan can facilitate model prototyping and testing, thus accelerating the data modeling process.
