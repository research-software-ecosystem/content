Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. Classical simulations of protein flexibility remain computationally expensive, especially for large proteins. A few years ago, we developed a fast method for predicting protein structure fluctuations that uses a single protein model as the input. The method has been made available as the CABS-flex web server and applied in numerous studies of protein structure-function relationships. Here, we present a major update of the CABS-flex web server to version 2.0. The new features include: extension of the method to significantly larger and multimeric proteins, customizable distance restraints and simulation parameters, contact maps and a new, enhanced web server interface. CABS-flex 2.0 is freely available at http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex2.","authors":["Kuriata A.","Gierut A.M.","Oleniecki T.","Ciemny M.P.","Kolinski A.","Kurcinski M.","Kmiecik S."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gky356","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"CABS-flex 2.0: A web server for fast simulations of flexibility of protein structures","type":"Primary","year":"2018-07-02"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cabs-flex_2.0","biotoolsID":"cabs-flex_2.0","description":"Fast method for predicting protein structure fluctuations that uses a single protein model as the input.","homepage":"http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSflex2","name":"CABS-flex 2.0"}}
