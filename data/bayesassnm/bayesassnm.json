To identify gene flow between demes as distinct from individual migration, we present a modified Bayesian method to genetically test for descendants between an immigrant and a resident in a nonmigratory life stage. Applied to a metapopulation of pond-breeding European newts (Triturus cristatus, T. marmoratus) in western France, the evidence for gene flow was usually asymmetric and, for demes of known census size (N), translated into maximally seven reproducing immigrants. Temporal sampling also enabled the joint estimation of the effective demic population size (Ne) and the immigration rate m (including nonreproductive individuals). Ne ranged between 4.1 and 19.3 individuals, Ne/N ranged between 0.05 and 0.65 and always decreased with N; m was estimated as 0.19-0.63, and was possibly biased upwards. We discuss how genotypic data can reveal fine-scale demographic processes with important microevolutionary implications. \u00a9 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.", "citationCount": 64, "authors": [{"name": "Jehle R."}, {"name": "Wilson G.A."}, {"name": "Arntzen J.W."}, {"name": "Burke T."}], "date": "2005-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Evolutionary Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.rannala.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "brannala@ucdavis.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bayesassnm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.rannala.org/?page_id=245", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Statistical inference", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3658"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Program that estimates recent migration rates between populations using MCMC.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/bayesassnm-1-0-bayesian-inference-migration-multilocus-genotypes-migrants-included-sample.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "bayesassnm", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:37:18Z", "name": "BayesAssNM", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://rannala.org/docs/BayesAssNM.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
