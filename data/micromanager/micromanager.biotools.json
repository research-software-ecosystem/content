It lets you execute common microscope image acquisition strategies such as time-lapses, multi-channel imaging, z-stacks, and combinations thereof. It works with microscopes from all four major manufacturers (Leica, Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss), most scientific-grade cameras and many peripherals (stages, filter wheels, shutters, etc.) used in microscope imaging.",

Software for microscope image acquisition should not only be easy to use, but also enable and encourage novel approaches. The open-source software package Manager aims to fulfill those goals. This unit provides step-by-step protocols describing how to get started working with Manager, as well as some starting points for advanced use of the software. \u00a9 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
