Software for microscope image acquisition should not only be easy to use, but also enable and encourage novel approaches. The open-source software package Manager aims to fulfill those goals. This unit provides step-by-step protocols describing how to get started working with Manager, as well as some starting points for advanced use of the software. © 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

It lets you execute common microscope image acquisition strategies such as time-lapses, multi-channel imaging, z-stacks, and combinations thereof. It works with microscopes from all four major manufacturers (Leica, Nikon, Olympus and Zeiss), most scientific-grade cameras and many peripherals (stages, filter wheels, shutters, etc.) used in microscope imaging.",
