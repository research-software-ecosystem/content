  "sc:description": "Algorithm implemented to identify hyper/hypomethylated genes for a disease. Based on a beta mixture model to identify methylation states and compares them with the normal DNA methylation state. It uses the Differential Methylation value or DM-value defined as the difference of a methylation state with the normal methylation state. Matched gene expression data is used to identify, besides differential, functional methylation states by focusing on methylation changes that effect gene expression.",
