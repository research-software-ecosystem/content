description: "\"ARB (ARBor, Latin: tree): A software environment for maintaining\n\
  databases of molecular sequences and additional information, and\nfor analyzing\
  \ the sequence data, with emphasis on phylogeny\nreconstruction.\n\nThe programs\
  \ have primarily been developed for ribosomal\nribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences\
  \ and, therefore, contain special\ntools for alignment and analysis of these structures.\
  \ However,\nother molecular sequence data can also be handled. Protein gene\nsequences\
  \ and predicted protein primary structures as well as\nprotein secondary structures\
  \ can be stored in the same database.\n\nThe ARB package is designed for graphical\
  \ user interface. Program\ncontrol and data display are available in a hierarchical\
  \ set of\nwindows and subwindows. The majority of operations can be\ncontrolled\
  \ using the mouse for moving the pointer and the left\nmouse button for initiating\
  \ and performing operations\"\n"
