                "abstract": "We discuss basic physical-chemical principles underlying the formation of stable macromolecular complexes, which in many cases are likely to be the biological units performing a certain physiological function. We also consider available theoretical approaches to the calculation of macromolecular affinity and entropy of complexation. The latter is shown to play an important role and make a major effect on complex size and symmetry. We develop a new method, based on chemical thermodynamics, for automatic detection of macromolecular assemblies in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries that are the results of X-ray diffraction experiments. As found, biological units may be recovered at 80-90% success rate, which makes X-ray crystallography an important source of experimental data on macromolecular complexes and protein-protein interactions. The method is implemented as a public WWW service†.†http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/prot int/pistart.html. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",
