A new computer program called TBA (for \"threaded blockset aligner\") builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that all matching segments occur in the same order and orientation in the given sequences; inversions and duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that different projections present consistent predictions of which genomic positions are orthologous. This capability is illustrated using a new visualization tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa Cruz Genome Browser. \u00a9 2004 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 716, "authors": [{"name": "Blanchette M."}, {"name": "Kent W.J."}, {"name": "Riemer C."}, {"name": "Elnitski L."}, {"name": "Smith A.F.A."}, {"name": "Roskin K.M."}, {"name": "Baertsch R."}, {"name": "Rosenbloom K."}, {"name": "Clawson H."}, {"name": "Green E.D."}, {"name": "Haussler D."}, {"name": "Miller W."}], "date": "2004-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr. Ross Hardison", "url": "http://globin.bx.psu.edu/html/contact.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "rch8@psu.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:multiz", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Computer program which builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that all matching segments occur in the same order and orientation in the given sequences; inversions and duplications are not addressed.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/multiz-tba-20090121-multi-sequence-aligner-package.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "multiz", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:52:04Z", "name": "Multiz", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/tba_howto.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
