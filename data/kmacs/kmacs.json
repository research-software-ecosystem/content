Therefore, alignment-free approaches have become popular in recent years. One of the best known alignment-free methods is the average common substring (ACS) approach that defines a distance measure on sequences based on the average length of longest common words between them. Herein, we generalize this approach by considering longest common substrings with k mismatches. We present a greedy heuristic to approximate the length of such k-mismatch substrings and we describe kmacs, an efficient implementation of this idea based on generalized enhanced suffix arrays. Results: To evaluate the performance of our approach, we applied it to phylogeny reconstruction using a large number of DNA and protein sequence sets. In most cases, phylogenetic trees calculated with kmacs were more accurate than trees produced with established alignment-free methods which are based on exact word matches. Especially on protein sequences, our method seems to be superior. On simulated protein families, kmacs even outperformed a classical approach to phylogeny reconstruction using multiple alignment and maximum likelihood. \u00a9 2014 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 55, "authors": [{"name": "Leimeister C.-A."}, {"name": "Morgenstern B."}], "date": "2014-07-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://gobics.de/department/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "lhahn@biologie.uni-goettingen.de"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "chris.leimeister@stud.uni-goettingen.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:kmacs", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://kmacs.gobics.de/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Polymorphism detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3202"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "New approach to alignment-free sequence comparison.
