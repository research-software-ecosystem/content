                "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a class of innovative biopharmaceutical drugs, which, via their antibody (mAb) component, deliver and release their potent warhead (a.k.a. payload) at the disease site, thereby simultaneously improving the efficacy of delivered therapy and reducing its off-target toxicity. To design ADCs of promising efficacy, it is crucial to have the critical data of pharma-information and biological activities for each ADC. However, no such database has been constructed yet. In this study, a database named ADCdb focusing on providing ADC information (especially its pharma-information and biological activities) from multiple perspectives was thus developed. Particularly, a total of 6572 ADCs (359 approved by FDA or in clinical trial pipeline, 501 in preclinical test, 819 with in-vivo testing data, 1868 with cell line/target testing data, 3025 without in-vivo/cell line/target testing data) together with their explicit pharma-information was collected and provided. Moreover, a total of 9171 literature-reported activities were discovered, which were identified from diverse clinical trial pipelines, model organisms, patient/cell-derived xenograft models, etc. Due to the significance of ADCs and their relevant data, this new database was expected to attract broad interests from diverse research fields of current biopharmaceutical drug discovery. The ADCdb is now publicly accessible at: https://idrblab.org/adcdb/.",
