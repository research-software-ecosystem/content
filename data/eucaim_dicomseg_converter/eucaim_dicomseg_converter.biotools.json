    "description": "This repository provides tools for segmentation files conversion in DicomSEG, with a primary focus on:\n\nDICOM RTSTRUCT to DICOM SEG: A Python script (rtstruct/rtstruct2dcmseg.py) converts DICOM Radiotherapy Structure Set (RTSTRUCT) files, along with their referenced DICOM image series, into DICOM Segmentation (SEG) objects. It can also optionally convert the individual Regions of Interest (ROIs) defined in the RTSTRUCT into separate NIfTI (.nii.gz) files.\nNifti Conversions via dcmqi and Custom Scripts: The Docker image built from this repository also includes command-line tools from dcmqi (DICOM Quantitative Imaging Toolkit) and custom Python scripts for various conversions, such as:\nITK image formats (NIfTI, NRRD) to/from DICOM SEG.\nDICOM series to NIfTI.\nDICOM SEG to NIfTI (custom alternative).",
