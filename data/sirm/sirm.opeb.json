Several software packages exist for metabolic flux analysis when provided a metabolic model and appropriate isotopomer and or isotopologue datasets, mostly from 13 C tracer time series experiments. However, assumptions of model correctness can seriously compromise interpretation of metabolic flux results generated from these packages. Therefore, we have developed a metabolic modeling software package specifically designed for moiety model comparison and selection based on the metabolomics data provided.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'moiety_modeling', 'metabolic' (bio.tools/metabolic), 'modeling', 'moiety'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/839241","name":"SIRM"}}
