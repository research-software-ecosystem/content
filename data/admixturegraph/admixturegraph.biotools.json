    "description": "Implements tools for building and visualising admixture graphs and for extracting equations from them. These equations can be compared to f- statistics obtained from data to test the consistency of a graph against data – for example by comparing the sign of f_4-statistics with the signs predicted by the graph – and graph parameters (edge lengths and admixture proportions) can be fitted to observed statistics.",
