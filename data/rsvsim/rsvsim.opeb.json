The structural variations can be generated randomly, based on user-supplied genomic coordinates or associated to various kinds of repeats. The package further comprises functions to estimate the distribution of structural variation sizes from real datasets. © The Author 2013.","authors":["Bartenhagen C.","Dugas M."],"cit_count":31,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btt198","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"RSVSim: An R/Bioconductor package for the simulation of structural variations","type":"Primary","year":"2013-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rsvsim","biotoolsID":"rsvsim","description":"Package for the simulation of deletions, insertions, inversion, tandem-duplications and translocations of various sizes in any genome available as FASTA-file or BSgenome data package.
