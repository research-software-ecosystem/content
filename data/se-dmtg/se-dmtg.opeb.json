Thus, various computational algorithms have been proposed for protein complex detection. However, most of these methods are based on only topological information and are sensitive to the reliability of interactions. As a result, their performance is affected by false-positive interactions in PPINs. Moreover, these methods consider only density and modularity and ignore protein complexes with various densities and modularities","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31390979","name":"SE-DMTG"}}
