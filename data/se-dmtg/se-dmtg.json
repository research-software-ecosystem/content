    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A seed-extended algorithm for detecting protein complexes based on density and modularity with topological structure and GO annotations | BACKGROUND:The detection of protein complexes is of great significance for researching mechanisms underlying complex diseases and developing new drugs. Thus, various computational algorithms have been proposed for protein complex detection. However, most of these methods are based on only topological information and are sensitive to the reliability of interactions. As a result, their performance is affected by false-positive interactions in PPINs. Moreover, these methods consider only density and modularity and ignore protein complexes with various densities and modularities",
