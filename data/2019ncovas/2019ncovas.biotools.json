However, transmission prediction models are insufficiently accurate and genome sequence characteristics are not clear, and it is difficult to dynamically assess the public psychological stress state under the 2019-nCoV epidemic. Therefore, this study develops a 2019nCoVAS web service (http://www.combio-lezhang.online/2019ncov/home.html) that not only offers online epidemic transmission prediction and lineage-associated underrepresented permutation (LAUP) analysis services to investigate the spreading trends and genome sequence characteristics, but also provides psychological stress assessments based on such an emotional dictionary that we built for 2019-nCoV. Finally, we discuss the shortcomings and further study of the 2019nCoVAS web service.",
