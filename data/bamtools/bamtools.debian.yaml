description: 'BamTools facilitates research analysis and data management using BAM
  files. It copes with the enormous amount of data produced by current sequencing
  technologies that is typically stored in compressed, binary formats that are not
  easily handled by the text-based parsers commonly used in bioinformatics research.
  . BamTools provides both a C++ API for BAM file support as well as a command-line
  toolkit. . This is the bamtools command-line toolkit. . Available bamtools commands:
  convert Converts between BAM and a number of other formats count Prints number of
  alignments in BAM file(s) coverage Prints coverage statistics from the input BAM
  file filter Filters BAM file(s) by user-specified criteria header Prints BAM header
  information index Generates index for BAM file merge Merge multiple BAM files into
  single file random Select random alignments from existing BAM file(s), intended
  more as a testing tool. resolve Resolves paired-end reads (marking the IsProperPair
  flag as needed) revert Removes duplicate marks and restores original base qualities
  sort Sorts the BAM file according to some criteria split Splits a BAM file on user-specified
  property, creating a new BAM output file for each value found stats Prints some
  basic statistics from input BAM file(s)'
