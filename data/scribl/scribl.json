Traditionally, such integrative analysis required desktop applications operating on locally stored data. Many current terabyte-size datasets generated by large public consortia projects, however, are already only feasibly stored at specialist genome analysis centers. As even small laboratories can afford very large datasets, local storage and analysis are becoming increasingly limiting, and it is likely that most such datasets will soon be stored remotely, e.g. in the cloud. These developments will require web-based tools that enable users to access, analyze and view vast remotely stored data with a level of sophistication and interactivity that approximates desktop applications. As rapidly dropping cost enables researchers to collect data intended to answer questions in very specialized contexts, developers must also provide software libraries that empower users to implement customized data analyses and data views for their particular application. Such specialized, yet lightweight, applications would empower scientists to better answer specific biological questions than possible with general-purpose genome browsers currently available.Results: Using recent advances in core web technologies (HTML5), we developed Scribl, a flexible genomic visualization library specifically targeting coordinate-based data such as genomic features, DNA sequence and genetic variants. Scribl simplifies the development of sophisticated web-based graphical tools that approach the dynamism and interactivity of desktop applications.Availability and implementation: Software is freely available online at http://chmille4.github.com/Scribl/and is implemented in JavaScript with all modern browsers supported.Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \u00a9 2012 The Author.", "citationCount": 19, "authors": [{"name": "Miller C.A."}, {"name": "Anthony J."}, {"name": "Meyer M.M."}, {"name": "Marth G."}], "date": "2013-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/meyerlab/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:scribl", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.1.4"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://chmille4.github.com/Scribl/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Canvas-based graphics library that easily generates biological visuals of genomic regions, alignments, and assembly data.
