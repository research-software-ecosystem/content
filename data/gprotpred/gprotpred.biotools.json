                "abstract": "\u00a9 2016 Elsevier B.V.Heterotrimeric G-proteins form a major protein family, which participates in signal transduction. They are composed of three subunits, G\u03b1, G\u03b2 and G\u03b3. The G\u03b1 subunit is further divided in four distinct families Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11 and G12/13. The goal of this work was to detect and classify members of the four distinct families, plus the G\u03b2 and the G\u03b3 subunits of G-proteins from sequence alone. To achieve this purpose, six specific profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) were built and checked for their credibility. These models were then applied to ten (10) proteomes and were able to identify all known G-protein and classify them into the distinct families. In a separate case study, the models were applied to twenty seven (27) arthropod proteomes and were able to give more credible classification in proteins with uncertain annotation and in some cases to detect novel proteins. An online tool, GprotPRED, was developed that uses these six pHMMs. The sensitivity and specificity for all pHMMs were equal to 100% with the exception of the G\u03b2 case, where sensitivity equals to 100%, while specificity is 99.993%. In contrast to Pfam's pHMM which detects G\u03b1 subunits in general, our method not only detects G\u03b1 subunits but also classifies them into the appropriate G\u03b1-protein family and thus could become a useful tool for the annotation of G-proteins in newly discovered proteomes. GprotPRED online tool is publicly available for non-commercial use at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/GprotPRED and, also, a standalone version of the tool at https://github.com/vkostiou/GprotPRED.",
