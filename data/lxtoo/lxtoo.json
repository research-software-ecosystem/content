However, many research groups lack computing facilities and specialists. This is an obstacle that remains to be addressed. Here, we present a Linux distribution, LXtoo, to provide a flexible computing platform for bioinformatics analysis. Findings: Unlike most of the existing live Linux distributions for bioinformatics limiting their usage to sequence analysis and protein structure prediction, LXtoo incorporates a comprehensive collection of bioinformatics software, including data mining tools for microarray and proteomics, protein-protein interaction analysis, and computationally complex tasks like molecular dynamics. Moreover, most of the programs have been configured and optimized for high performance computing. Conclusions: LXtoo aims to provide well-supported computing environment tailored for bioinformatics research, reducing duplication of efforts in building computing infrastructure. LXtoo is distributed as a Live DVD and freely available at http://bioinformatics.jnu.edu.cn/LXtoo. \u00a9 2012 Yu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Yu G."}, {"name": "Wang L.-G."}, {"name": "Meng X.-H."}, {"name": "He Q.-Y."}], "date": "2012-08-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Research Notes"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://xxxy.jnu.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "guangchuangyu@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:lxtoo", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.jnu.edu.cn/LXtoo/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Deposition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3431"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Customized Linux distribution for bioinformatics research.
