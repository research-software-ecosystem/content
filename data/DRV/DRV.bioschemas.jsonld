      "sc:description": "visualisation of specificity determining patterns of protein binding DNA segments.\n\nSUMMARY:The sequence specific recognition of DNA by regulatory proteins typically occurs by establishing hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts between chemical substructures of nucleotides and amino acids forming the compatible interacting surfaces. The recognition process is also influenced by the physicochemical and conformational character of the target oligonucleotide motif. Although the role of these mechanisms in DNA-protein interactions is well-established, bioinformatical methods rarely address them directly, instead binding specificity is mostly assessed at nucleotide level. DNA Readout Viewer (DRV) aims to provide a novel DNA representation, facilitating in-depth view into these mechanisms by the concurrent visualisation of functional groups and a diverse collection of DNA descriptors.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:DRV', 'DNA Readout Viewer'",
