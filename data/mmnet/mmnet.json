Previous microbiome studies focused mainly on single pure species function and overlooked the interactions in the complex communities on system-level. A metagenomic approach introduced recently integrates metagenomic data with community-level metabolic network modeling, but no comprehensive tool was available for such kind of approaches. To facilitate these kinds of studies, we developed an R package, mmnet, to implement community-level metabolic network reconstruction. The package also implements a set of functions for automatic analysis pipeline construction including functional annotation of metagenomic reads, abundance estimation of enzymatic genes, community-level metabolic network reconstruction, and integrated network analysis. The result can be represented in an intuitive way and sent to Cytoscape for further exploration. The package has substantial potentials in metagenomic studies that focus on identifying system-level variations of human microbiome associated with disease.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Cao Y."}, {"name": "Zheng X."}, {"name": "Li F."}, {"name": "Bo X."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BioMed Research International"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yang Cao", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yiluheihei@gmail.com"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Fei Li", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "pittacus@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mmnet", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.12.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mmnet/versions/1.10.2", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package gives the implementations microbiome metabolic network constructing and analyzing.
