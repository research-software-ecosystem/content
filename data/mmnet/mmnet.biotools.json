    "description": "This package gives the implementations microbiome metabolic network constructing and analyzing. It introduces a unique metagenomic systems biology approach, mapping metagenomic data to the KEGG global metabolic pathway and constructing a systems-level network. The system-level network and the next topological analysis will be of great help to analysis the various functional properties, including regulation and metabolic functionality of the metagenome.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2015 Yang Cao et al.The human microbiome plays important roles in human health and disease. Previous microbiome studies focused mainly on single pure species function and overlooked the interactions in the complex communities on system-level. A metagenomic approach introduced recently integrates metagenomic data with community-level metabolic network modeling, but no comprehensive tool was available for such kind of approaches. To facilitate these kinds of studies, we developed an R package, mmnet, to implement community-level metabolic network reconstruction. The package also implements a set of functions for automatic analysis pipeline construction including functional annotation of metagenomic reads, abundance estimation of enzymatic genes, community-level metabolic network reconstruction, and integrated network analysis. The result can be represented in an intuitive way and sent to Cytoscape for further exploration. The package has substantial potentials in metagenomic studies that focus on identifying system-level variations of human microbiome associated with disease.",
