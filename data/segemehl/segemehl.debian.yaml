description: Segemehl is a software to map short sequencer reads to reference genomes.
  Segemehl implements a matching strategy based on enhanced suffix arrays (ESA). Segemehl
  accepts fasta and fastq queries (gzip'ed and bgzip'ed). In addition to the alignment
  of reads from standard DNA- and RNA-seq protocols, it also allows the mapping of
  bisulfite converted reads (Lister and Cokus) and implements a split read mapping
  strategy. The output of segemehl is a SAM or BAM formatted alignment file. In the
  case of split-read mapping, additional BED files are written to the disc. These
  BED files may be summarized with the postprocessing tool haarz. In the case of the
  alignment of bisulfite converted reads, raw methylation rates may also be called
  with haarz. . In brief, for each suffix of a read, segemehl aims to find the best-scoring
  seed. Seeds might contain insertions, deletions, and mismatches (differences). The
  number of differences allowed within a single seed is user-controlled and is crucial
  for the runtime of the program. Subsequently, seeds that undercut the user-defined
  E-value are passed on to an exact semi-global alignment procedure. Finally, reads
  with a minimum accuracy of percent are reported to the user.
