It helps to provide a detailed overview of disease complex microenvironment. Moreover, online availability of thousands of gene expression assays made microarray data classification an active research area. A common goal is to find a minimum subset of genes and maximizing the classification accuracy. METHODS:In pursuit of a similar objective, we have proposed framework (C-HMOSHSSA) for gene selection using multi-objective spotted hyena optimizer (MOSHO) and salp swarm algorithm (SSA)",
