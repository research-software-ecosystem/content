The 287 102 tRNA genes in total, and thus two times of the tRNA genes compiled previously, are compiled, in which sequence information, clover-leaf structure and results of sequence similarity and oligonucleotide-pattern search can be browsed. In order to pool collective knowledge with help from any experts in the tRNA research field, we included a column to which comments can be added on each tRNA gene. By compiling tRNAs of known prokaryotes with identical sequences, we found high phylogenetic preservation of tRNA sequences, especially at a phylum level. Furthermore, a large number of tRNAs obtained by metagenome analyses of environmental samples had sequences identical to those found in known prokaryotes. The identical sequence group, therefore, can be used as phylogenetic markers to clarify the microbial community structure of an ecosystem. The updated tRNADB-CE provided functions, with which users can obtain the phylotype-specific markers (e.g. genus-specific markers) by themselves and clarify microbial community structures of ecosystems in detail. tRNADB-CE can be accessed freely at http://trna.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Abe T.","Ikemura T.","Sugahara J.","Kanai A.","Ohara Y.","Uehara H.","Kinouchi M.","Kanaya S.","Yamada Y.","Muto A.","Inokuchi H."],"cit_count":36,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21071414","title":"TRNADB-CE 2011: TRNA gene database curated manually by experts","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:trnadb-ce","biotoolsID":"trnadb-ce","description":"The tRNA Gene DataBase Curated by Experts \"\"tRNADB-CE\"\" contains tRNA sequences.","homepage":"http://trna.nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp","name":"tRNADB-CE"}}
