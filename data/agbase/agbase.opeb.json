The website is redesigned to improve accessibility and ease of use, including improved search capabilities. Expanded capabilities include new dedicated pages for horse, cat, dog, cotton, rice and soybean. We currently provide 590 240 Gene Ontology (GO) annotations to 105 454 gene products in 64 different species, including GO annotations linked to transcripts represented on agricultural microarrays. For many of these arrays, this provides the only functional annotation available. GO annotations are available for download and we provide comprehensive, species-specific GO annotation files for 18 different organisms. The tools available at AgBase have been expanded and several existing tools improved based upon user feedback. One of seven new tools available at AgBase, GOModeler, supports hypothesis testing from functional genomics data. We host several associated databases and provide genome browsers for three agricultural pathogens. Moreover, we provide comprehensive training resources (including worked examples and tutorials) via links to Educational Resources at the AgBase website. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["McCarthy F.M.","Gresham C.R.","Buza T.J.","Chouvarine P.","Pillai L.R.","Kumar R.","Ozkan S.","Wang H.","Manda P.","Arick T.","Bridges S.M.","Burgess S.C."],"cit_count":36,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21075795","title":"AgBase: Supporting functional modeling in agricultural organisms","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:agbase","biotoolsID":"agbase","description":"AgBase provides resources to facilitate modeling of functional genomics data and structural and functional annotation of agriculturally important animal, plant, microbe and parasite genomes.
