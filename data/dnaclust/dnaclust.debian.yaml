summary: tool for clustering millions of short DNA sequences
description: >
   dnaclust is a tool for clustering large number of short DNA sequences.
   The clusters are created in such a way that the "radius" of each
   clusters is no more than the specified threshold.
   .
   The input sequences to be clustered should be in Fasta format. The id
   of each sequence is based on the first word of the seqeunce in the Fasta
   format. The first word is the prefix of the header up to the first
   occurrence of white space characters in the header.
