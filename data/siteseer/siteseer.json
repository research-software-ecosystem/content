It is well established that specific DNA sequences located upstream of the transcriptional start site are important in facilitating the binding of regulatory proteins that control the transcription of the gene. Indeed, microarray-based studies have successfully mined the upstream regions of co-expressed genes and discovered over-represented sequences corresponding to known promoter sites. Here we describe a tool for the visualisation of mapped transcription factor binding sites in the upstream regions of either single or grouped eukaryotic genes, which allows users to examine the positions of known and user-defined sites (http://rocky.bms.umist.ac.uk/SiteSeer/). SiteSeer allows the user to map different sections of the TRANSFAC and SCPD databases (or a set of user-defined sites) onto nucleotide sequences. Additionally, users may restrict the analysis by expectation values for certain DNA words as well as by known binding sites specific to a given organism. We believe this tool will prove particularly valuable for biologists who wish to examine sets of co-expressed or functionally-related genes and those who wish to visualise the positions of promoter sequences and generate displays for publications.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Boardman P.E."}, {"name": "Oliver S.G."}, {"name": "Hubbard S.J."}], "date": "2003-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Paul Boardman", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "peb@bms.umist.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:siteseer", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rocky.bms.umist.ac.uk/SiteSeer/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}, {"term": "Promoter prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0440"}, {"term": "Transcription factor binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0445"}, {"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}, {"term": "Mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2429"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "SiteSeer is a visualization tool for mapping transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the upstream regions of single or grouped eukaryotic genes.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "siteseer", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T11:36:02Z", "name": "SiteSeer", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.chick.manchester.ac.uk/SiteSeer/help.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
