      "sc:description": "An Open Non-Contact Imaging-Based Physiological Measurement Toolbox.\n\nIn the past few years a lot of attention has been given to methods for remotely measuring physiological signals using low-cost cameras. Imaging PPG (iPPG) focuses on the measurement of volumetric changes in blood flow at distance from the body using imaging devices to capture changes in transmitted or reflected light. Imaging ballistocardiography (iBCG) typically leverages optical flow estimation to track the vertical motion of the head or body from a video sequence. Both iPPG and iBCG methods can be used to recover human vital signals.",
