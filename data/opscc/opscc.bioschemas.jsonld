METHODS:Patients with OPSCC treated with primary radiotherapy at Rigshospitalet in the period 2010-2017 were included. All patients had a pretreatment FDG PET CT scan performed. Four cause-specific Cox regression models were built for the hazard ratios (HR) of recurrence in T-, N-, M-site, and death with no evidence of disease (NED), respectively. The following variables were included: T-, N-stage, p16 status, metabolic tumor volume, and FDG uptake in both primary tumor and lymph nodes.",
