METHODS:Patients with OPSCC treated with primary radiotherapy at Rigshospitalet in the period 2010-2017 were included. All patients had a pretreatment FDG PET CT scan performed. Four cause-specific Cox regression models were built for the hazard ratios (HR) of recurrence in T-, N-, M-site, and death with no evidence of disease (NED), respectively. The following variables were included: T-, N-stage, p16 status, metabolic tumor volume, and FDG uptake in both primary tumor and lymph nodes.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'FDG PET'",

Methods: Patients with OPSCC treated with primary radiotherapy at Rigshospitalet in the period 2010\u20132017 were included. All patients had a pretreatment FDG PET/CT scan performed. Four cause-specific Cox regression models were built for the hazard ratios (HR) of recurrence in T-, N-, M-site, and death with no evidence of disease (NED), respectively. The following variables were included: T-, N-stage, p16 status, metabolic tumor volume, and FDG uptake in both primary tumor and lymph nodes. A competing risk analysis was performed and absolute risk estimates were estimated using the Aalen\u2013Johansen method. Results: Overall, 441 patients were included. Thirty-four patients had T-site recurrence, 31 N-site recurrence, 32 M-site recurrence, and 52 patients had death NED as event. Nodal FDG uptake had a significant impact on N- and M-site recurrence, with HRs of 2.13 (CI 1.20\u20133.77) and 2.18 (CI 1.16\u20134.10). The individual prognostication of absolute risk of the four events for any given patient can be assessed in the online tool (https://rasmussen.shinyapps.io/OPSCCmodelFDG_PET/). Conclusion: High nodal FDG uptake increases the risk of N- and M-site recurrence in patients with OPSCC in a competing risk scenario. The reported results are available in an easy applicable online tool and can help identify relevant candidates for future trials testing treatment approaches.",
