In this paper, we present a novel approach called SNAP for non-sequential pair-wise structural alignment. Starting from an initial alignment, our approach iterates over a two-step process consisting of a superposition step and an alignment step, until convergence. We propose a novel greedy algorithm to construct both sequential and non-sequential alignments. The quality of SNAP alignments were assessed by comparing against the manually curated reference alignments in the challenging SISY and RIPC datasets. Moreover, when applied to a dataset of 4410 protein pairs selected from the CATH database, SNAP produced longer alignments with lower rmsd than several state-of-the-art alignment methods. Classification of folds using SNAP alignments was both highly sensitive and highly selective. The SNAP software along with the datasets are available online at. \u00a9 2009 Imperial College Press.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Salem S."}, {"name": "ZakiI M.J."}, {"name": "Bystroff C."}], "date": "2009-06-19T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/www-new/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "zaki@cs.rpi.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:snap-align", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/www-new/pmwiki.php/Software/Software#toc31", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool finds non-sequential 3D protein structure alignments.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/snap-20080926-non-sequential-pair-wise-structural-alignment.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "snap-align", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:59:56Z", "name": "SNAP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/www-new/pmwiki.php/Software/Software#toc31", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
