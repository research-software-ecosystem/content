All rights reserved. Next-generation mass spectrometric (MS) techniques such as SWATH-MS have substantially increased the throughput and reproducibility of proteomic analysis, but ensuring consistent quantification of thousands of peptide analytes across multiple liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) runs remains a challenging and laborious manual process. To produce highly consistent and quantitatively accurate proteomics data matrices in an automated fashion, we developed TRIC (http://proteomics.ethz.ch/tric/), a software tool that utilizes fragment-ion data to perform cross-run alignment, consistent peak-picking and quantification for high-throughput targeted proteomics. TRIC reduced the identification error compared to a state-of-the-art SWATH-MS analysis without alignment by more than threefold at constant recall while correcting for highly nonlinear chromatographic effects. On a pulsed-SILAC experiment performed on human induced pluripotent stem cells, TRIC was able to automatically align and quantify thousands of light and heavy isotopic peak groups. Thus, TRIC fills a gap in the pipeline for automated analysis of massively parallel targeted proteomics data sets.", "citationCount": 31, "authors": [{"name": "Rost H.L."}, {"name": "Liu Y."}, {"name": "D'Agostino G."}, {"name": "Zanella M."}, {"name": "Navarro P."}, {"name": "Rosenberger G."}, {"name": "Collins B.C."}, {"name": "Gillet L."}, {"name": "Testa G."}, {"name": "Malmstrom L."}, {"name": "Aebersold R."}], "date": "2016-08-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Methods"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.imsb.ethz.ch/research/aebersold.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://github.com/msproteomicstools", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tric", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://proteomics.ethz.ch/tric/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:41:37Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An alignment software for targeted proteomics (SRM or SWATH-MS) data.
