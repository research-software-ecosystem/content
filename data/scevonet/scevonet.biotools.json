                "abstract": "Background: Exploring the function or the developmental history of cells in various organisms provides insights into a given cell type's core molecular characteristics and putative evolutionary mechanisms. Numerous computational methods now exist for analyzing single-cell data and identifying cell states. These methods mostly rely on the expression of genes considered as markers for a given cell state. Yet, there is a lack of scRNA-seq computational tools to study the evolution of cell states, particularly how cell states change their molecular profiles. This can include novel gene activation or the novel deployment of programs already existing in other cell types, known as co-option. Results: Here we present scEvoNet, a Python tool for predicting cell type evolution in cross-species or cancer-related scRNA-seq datasets. ScEvoNet builds the confusion matrix of cell states and a bipartite network connecting genes and cell states. It allows a user to obtain a set of genes shared by the characteristic signature of two cell states even between distantly-related datasets. These genes can be used as indicators of either evolutionary divergence or co-option occurring during organism or tumor evolution. Our results on cancer and developmental datasets indicate that scEvoNet is a helpful tool for the initial screening of such genes as well as for measuring cell state similarities. Conclusion: The scEvoNet package is implemented in Python and is freely available from https://github.com/monsoro/scEvoNet. Utilizing this framework and exploring the continuum of transcriptome states between developmental stages and species will help explain cell state dynamics.",
