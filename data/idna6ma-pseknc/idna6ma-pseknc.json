N 6 -methyladenine (6mA) is one kind of post-replication modification (PTM or PTRM) occurring in a wide range of DNA sequences. Accurate identification of its sites will be very helpful for revealing the biological functions of 6mA, but it is time-consuming and expensive to determine them by experiments alone. Unfortunately, so far, no bioinformatics tool is available to do so. To fill in such an empty area, we have proposed a novel predictor called iDNA6mA-PseKNC that is established by incorporating nucleotide physicochemical properties into Pseudo K-tuple Nucleotide Composition (PseKNC). It has been observed via rigorous cross-validations that the predictor's sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc), and stability (MCC) are 93%, 100%, 96%, and 0.93, respectively. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user-friendly web server for iDNA6mA-PseKNC has been established at http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-PseKNC, by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equations involved.", "citationCount": 57, "authors": [{"name": "Feng P."}, {"name": "Yang H."}, {"name": "Ding H."}, {"name": "Lin H."}, {"name": "Chen W."}, {"name": "Chou K.-C."}], "date": "2019-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Hao Lin", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hlin@uestc.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:iDNA6mA-PseKNC", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lin-group.cn/server/iDNA6mA-PseKNC", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Post-translation modification site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0417"}, {"term": "PTM localisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3755"}, {"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-06-01T14:49:24Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Identification of DNA N6-methyladenosine sites by incorporating nucleotide physicochemical properties into PseKNC.", "toolType": ["Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "iDNA6mA-PseKNC", "additionDate": "2019-06-01T14:49:24Z", "name": "iDNA6mA-PseKNC", "license": "Unlicense", "documentation": [], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
