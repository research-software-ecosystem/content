Computational models have been developed to predict genome-wide nucleosome positions from DNA sequences, but these models consider only nucleosome sequences, which may have limited their power. We developed a statistical multi-resolution approach to identify a sequence signature, called the N-score, that distinguishes nucleosome binding DNA from non-nucleosome DNA. This new approach has significantly improved the prediction accuracy. The sequence information is highly predictive for local nucleosome enrichment or depletion, whereas predictions of the exact positions are only modestly more accurate than a null model, suggesting the importance of other regulatory factors in fine-tuning the nucleosome positions. The N-score in promoter regions is negatively correlated with gene expression levels. Regulatory elements are enriched in low N-score regions. While our model is derived from yeast data, the Nscore pattern computed from this model agrees well with recent high-resolution protein-binding data in human. \u00a9 2008 Yuan and Liu.", "citationCount": 149, "authors": [{"name": "Yuan G.-C."}, {"name": "Liu J.S."}], "date": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Guo-Cheng Yuan", "url": "http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~gcyuan/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gcyuan@jimmy.harvard.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:n-score", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~gcyuan/software.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Wavelet analysis based model for predicting nucleosome positions from DNA sequence information.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["MATLAB"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/n-score-predict-nucleosome-positions-dna-sequence-information.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "n-score", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:52:10Z", "name": "N-score", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu/~gcyuan/software.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
