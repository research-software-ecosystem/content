    "description": "measuring functional diversity across scales based on TPD with R | Methods for Measuring Functional Diversity Based on Trait Probability Density | Tools to calculate trait probability density functions (TPD) at any scale (e.g. populations, species, communities). TPD functions are used to compute several indices of functional diversity, as well as its partition across scales. These indices constitute a unified framework that incorporates the underlying probabilistic nature of trait distributions into uni- or multidimensional functional trait-based studies. See Carmona et al. (2016) <doi:10.1016/j.tree.2016.02.003> for further information",
