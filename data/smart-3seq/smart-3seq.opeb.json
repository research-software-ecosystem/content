Small samples or those whose RNA is degraded, such as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, remain challenging to study with nonspecialized RNA-seq protocols. Here, we present a new method, Smart-3SEQ, that accurately quantifies transcript abundance even with small amounts of total RNA and effectively characterizes small samples extracted by laser-capture microdissection (LCM) from FFPE tissue. We also obtain distinct biological profiles from FFPE single cells, which have been impossible to study with previous RNA-seq protocols, and we use these data to identify possible new macrophage phenotypes associated with the tumor microenvironment. We propose Smart-3SEQ as a highly cost-effective method to enable large gene expression profiling experiments unconstrained by sample size and tissue availability. In particular, Smart-3SEQ's compatibility with FFPE tissue unlocks an enormous number of archived clinical samples; combined with LCM it allows unprecedented studies of small cell populations and single cells isolated by their in situ context.","authors":["Foley J.W.","Zhu C.","Jolivet P.","Zhu S.X.","Lu P.","Meaney M.J.","West R.B."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1101/GR.234807.118","journal":"Genome research","pmid":"31519740","title":"Gene expression profiling of single cells from archival tissue with laser-capture microdissection and Smart-3SEQ","year":"2019-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:Smart-3SEQ","biotoolsID":"Smart-3SEQ","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | Gene expression profiling of single cells from archival tissue with laser-capture microdissection and Smart-3SEQ | scripts used in the Smart-3SEQ paper","homepage":"https://github.com/jwfoley/Smart-3SEQ_paper_scripts","name":"Smart-3SEQ"}}
