description: Genome level Trellis graph visualizes genomic data conditioned by genomic
  categories (e.g. chromosomes). For each genomic category, multiple dimensional data
  which are represented as tracks describe different features from different aspects.
  This package provides high flexibility to arrange genomic categories and to add
  self-defined graphics in the plot.
