description: 'Numerical and graphical summaries of RNA-Seq read data. Within-lane
  normalization procedures to adjust for GC-content effect (or other gene-level effects)
  on read counts: loess robust local regression, global-scaling, and full-quantile
  normalization (Risso et al., 2011). Between-lane normalization procedures to adjust
  for distributional differences between lanes (e.g., sequencing depth): global-scaling
  and full-quantile normalization (Bullard et al., 2010).'
