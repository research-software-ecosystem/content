The page number of S, denoted π(S), is the minimum number k such that S can be decomposed into a disjoint union of k secondary structures. Here, we show that computing the page number is NP-complete; we describe an exact computation of page number, using constraint programming, and determine the page number of a collection of RNA tertiary structures, for which the topological genus is known. We describe an approximation algorithm from which it follows that ω(S) ≤ π(S) ≤ ω(S)· log n, where the clique number of S, ω(S), denotes the maximum number of base pairs that pairwise cross each other. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","authors":["Clote P.","Dobrev S.","Dotu I.","Kranakis E.","Krizanc D.","Urrutia J."],"cit_count":6,"journal":"Journal of Mathematical Biology","pmid":"22159642","title":"On the page number of RNA secondary structures with pseudoknots","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rnapagenumber","biotoolsID":"rnapagenumber","description":"A web server that computes the optimal \"page number\" of an RNA pseudoknotted or tertiary structure, by using constraint programming (CP); input as a PDB file or .ct (mfold connect) file.","homepage":"http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/RNApagenumber/index.spy","name":"rnapagenumber"}}
