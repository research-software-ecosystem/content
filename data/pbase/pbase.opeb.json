KGaA, Weinheim.Data visualization plays a key role in high-throughput biology. It is an essential tool for data exploration allowing to shed light on data structure and patterns of interest. Visualization is also of paramount importance as a form of communicating data to a broad audience. Here, we provided a short overview of the application of the R software to the visualization of proteomics data. We present a summary of R's plotting systems and how they are used to visualize and understand raw and processed MS-based proteomics data.","authors":["Gatto L.","Breckels L.M.","Naake T.","Gibb S."],"cit_count":18,"doi":"10.1002/pmic.201400392","journal":"Proteomics","title":"Visualization of proteomics data using R and Bioconductor","type":"Review","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pbase","biotoolsID":"pbase","description":"A set of classes and functions to investigate and understand protein sequence data in the context of a proteomics experiment.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Pbase.html","name":"Pbase","version":["0.14.0"]}}
