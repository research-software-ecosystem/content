    "description": "PROcessor of SEQuences is a program for sequence editing and population genetics analysis. It is quite a convenient tool for sequence handling and preliminary molecular evolution analysis. However, it is recommended to check the results of the analyses by the other software since the program is under development and not all the parts of the program are thoroughly tested and completely reliable",

Here I describe a program for handling and population genetic analysis of DNA polymorphism data collected from multiple genes. The program includes a sequence/alignment editor and an internal relational database that simplify the preparation and manipulation of multigenic DNA polymorphism datasets. The most commonly used DNA polymorphism analyses are implemented in ProSeq3, facilitating population genetic analysis of large multigenic datasets. Extensive input/output options make ProSeq3 a convenient hub for sequence data processing and analysis. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.",
