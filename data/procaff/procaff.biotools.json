For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Protein-carbohydrate interactions perform several cellular and biological functions and their structure and function are mainly dictated by their binding affinity. Although plenty of experimental data on binding affinity are available, there is no reliable and comprehensive database in the literature. Results: We have developed a database on binding affinity of protein-carbohydrate complexes, ProCaff, which contains 3122 entries on dissociation constant (Kd), Gibbs free energy change (\u0394G), experimental conditions, sequence, structure and literature information. Additional features include the options to search, display, visualization, download and upload the data. Contact: gromiha@iitm.ac.in",
