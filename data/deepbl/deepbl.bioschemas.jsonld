      "sc:description": "DeepBL is a deep learning-based approach for beta-lactamase classification using protein or genome sequence data. DeepBL is a high-throughput and deep learning-based multi-class classifier, to accurately identify beta-lactamase classes by incorporating sequence-derived features. DeepBL was implemented based on the Small VGGNet architecture and using the TensorFlow deep learning library. We evaluated DeepBL on carefully prepared benchmark and independent test datasets and the results of the 10-fold cross-validation and independent test demonstrate DeepBL’s robustness and generalization.",
