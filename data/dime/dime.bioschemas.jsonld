      "sc:description": "Integration of immunome with disease gene network reveals pleiotropy and novel drug repurposing targets.\n\nAbstract Immune system is crucial for the development and progression of immune-mediated and non-immune mediated complex diseases. Studies have shown that multiple complex diseases are associated with several immunologically relevant genes. Despite such growing evidence, the effect of disease associated genes on immune functions has not been well explored. Here, we curated the largest immunome (transcriptome profiles of 40 different immune cells) and integrated it with disease gene networks and drug-gene database, to generate a Disease-gene IMmune cell Expression network (DIME).\nIs a Shiny app.",
