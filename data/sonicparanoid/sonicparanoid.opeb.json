Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation Orthology inference constitutes a common base of many genome-based studies, as a pre-requisite for annotating new genomes, finding target genes for biotechnological applications and revealing the evolutionary history of life. Although its importance keeps rising with the ever-growing number of sequenced genomes, existing tools are computationally demanding and difficult to employ. Results Here, we present SonicParanoid, which is faster than, but comparably accurate to, the well-established tools with a balanced precision-recall trade-off. Furthermore, SonicParanoid substantially relieves the difficulties of orthology inference for those who need to construct and maintain their own genomic datasets. Availability and implementation SonicParanoid is available with a GNU GPLv3 license on the Python Package Index and BitBucket.
