            "abstract": "Motivation: The prediction of localization sites of various proteins is an important and challenging problem in the field of molecular biology. TargetP, by Emanuelsson et al. (J. Mol. Biol., 300, 1005-1016, 2000) is a neural network based system which is currently the best predictor in the literature for N-terminal sorting signals. One drawback of neural networks, however, is that it is generally difficult to understand and interpret how and why they make such predictions. In this paper, we aim to generate simple and interpretable rules as predictors, and still achieve a practical prediction accuracy. We adopt an approach which consists of an extensive search for simple rules and various attributes which is partially guided by human intuition. Results: We have succeeded in finding rules whose prediction accuracies come close to that of TargetP, while still retaining a very simple and interpretable form. We also discuss and interpret the discovered rules.",

PSORTdb (http://db.psort.org/) is a web-accessible database of SCL for bacteria that contains both information determined through laboratory experimentation and computational predictions. The dataset of experimentally verified information (∼2000 proteins) was manually curated by us and represents the largest dataset of its kind. Earlier versions have been used for training SCL predictors, and its incorporation now into this new PSORTdb resource, with its associated additional annotation information and dataset version control, should aid researchers in future development of improved SCL predictors. The second component of this database contains computational analyses of proteins deduced from the most recent NCBI dataset of completely sequenced genomes. Analyses are currently calculated using PSORTb, the most precise automated SCL predictor for bacterial proteins. Both datasets can be accessed through the web using a very flexible text search engine, a data browser, or using BLAST, and the entire database or search results may be downloaded in various formats. Features such as GO ontologies and multiple accession numbers are incorporated to facilitate integration with other bioinformatics resources.

            "abstract": "We have developed an expert system that makes use of various kinds of knowledge organized as “if‐then” rules for predicting protein localization sites in Gram‐negative bacteria, given the amino acid sequence information alone. We considered four localization sites: the cytoplasm, the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane, the periplasm, and the outer membrane. Most rules were derived from experimental observations. For example, the rule to recognize an inner membrane protein is the presence of either a hydrophobic stretch in the predicted mature protein or an uncleavable N‐terminal signal sequence. Lipoproteins are first recognized by a consensus pattern and then assumed present at either the inner or outer membrane. These two possibilities are further discriminated by examining an acidic residue in the mature N‐terminal portion. Furthermore, we found an empirical rule that periplasmic and outer membrane proteins were successfully discriminated by their different amino acid composition. Overall, our system could predict 83% of the localization sites of proteins in our database. Copyright © 1991 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

A set of sequence derived features, such as regions of high hydrophobicity, were used for each classifier. The methods compared were a structured probabilistic model specifically designed for the localization problem, the k nearest neighbors classifier, the binary decision tree classifier, and the naïve Bayes classifier. The result of tests using stratified cross validation shows the k nearest neighbors classifier to perform better than the other methods. In the case of yeast this difference was statistically significant using a cross-validated paired t test. The result is an accuracy of approximately 60% for 10 yeast classes and 86% for 8 E. coli classes. The best previously reported accuracies for these datasets were 55% and 81% respectively.",

            "abstract": "Automated prediction of bacterial protein subcellular localization is an important tool for genome annotation and drug discovery. PSORT has been one of the most widely used computational methods for such bacterial protein analysis; however, it has not been updated since it was introduced in 1991. In addition, neither PSORT nor any of the other computational methods available make predictions for all five of the localization sites characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria. Here we present PSORT-B, an updated version of PSORT for Gram-negative bacteria, which is available as a web-based application at http://www.psort.org. PSORT-B examines a given protein sequence for amino acid composition, similarity to proteins of known localization, presence of a signal peptide, transmembrane alpha-helices and motifs corresponding to specific localizations. A probabilistic method integrates these analyses, returning a list of five possible localization sites with associated probability scores. PSORT-B, designed to favor high precision (specificity) over high recall (sensitivity), attained an overall precision of 97% and recall of 75% in 5-fold cross-validation tests, using a dataset we developed of 1443 proteins of experimentally known localization. This dataset, the largest of its kind, is freely available, along with the PSORT-B source code (under GNU General Public License).",
