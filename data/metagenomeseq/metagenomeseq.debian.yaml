description: "MetagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational Taxanomic\
  \ Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant between two or more\
  \ groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq is designed to address the effects of\
  \ both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities on disease association\
  \ detection and the testing of feature correlations.\n"
