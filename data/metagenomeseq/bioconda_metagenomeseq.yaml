description: metagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (be it Operational Taxanomic
  Unit (OTU), species, etc.) that are differentially abundant between two or more
  groups of multiple samples. metagenomeSeq is designed to address the effects of
  both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities on disease association
  detection and the testing of feature correlations.
