All rights reserved. Complete knowledge of the genetic variation in individual human genomes is a crucial foundation for understanding the etiology of disease. Genetic variation is typically characterized by sequencing individual genomes and comparing reads to a reference. Existing methods do an excellent job of detecting variants in approximately 90% of the human genome; however, calling variants in the remaining 10% of the genome (largely low-complexity sequence and segmental duplications) is challenging. To improve variant calling, we developed a new algorithm, DISCOVAR, and examined its performance on improved, low-cost sequence data. Using a newly created reference set of variants from the finished sequence of 103 randomly chosen fosmids, we find that some standard variant call sets miss up to 25% of variants. We show that the combination of new methods and improved data increases sensitivity by several fold, with the greatest impact in challenging regions of the human genome.", "citationCount": 63, "authors": [{"name": "Weisenfeld N.I."}, {"name": "Yin S."}, {"name": "Sharpe T."}, {"name": "Lau B."}, {"name": "Hegarty R."}, {"name": "Holmes L."}, {"name": "Sogoloff B."}, {"name": "Tabbaa D."}, {"name": "Williams L."}, {"name": "Russ C."}, {"name": "Nusbaum C."}, {"name": "Lander E.S."}, {"name": "Maccallum I."}, {"name": "Jaffe D.B."}], "date": "2014-12-11T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://www.broadinstitute.org/contact", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:discovar", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/discovar/blog/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Variant calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3227"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Variant caller designed for state-of-the-art data.
