      "sc:description": "DiversitySamplingPlots (DWB-DSP) is an application of Diversity Workbench (DWB). It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. Each DWB module is devoted to a specific data domain. DSP is focussed on the management of sampling plots. It is a tool designed for biodiversity, geodiversity, ecological and geosciences research projects. In this context it is appropriate to design plots, organise the geographical position of geoobjects and the geometry of the plots as well as of georeferenced objects found on the plots. DSP is able to import sampling plots from other sources and formats (e. g., ArcView shape files) classifying them hierarchically and annotating them. The Diversity GIS Editor is integrated.",
