      "sc:description": "A public health decision support system for measuring obesogenic behaviors of children in relation to their local environment. Inferring the Spatial Distribution of Physical Activity in Children Population from Characteristics of the Environment. Children and adolescents with obesity have a higher risk of developing various diseases later on, compared to children without obesity. The reasons why some children become obese are complex, and behaviour, the living environment, and public health policies all play a role. BigO collects and analyses anonymous data on children's behavioural patterns and their living environment. With advanced analytics BigO extracts data-driven evidence on which local factors are involved, and how these factors influence childhood obesity in Europe.",
