  "sc:description": "A Comparison and Evaluation Platform for Integration Methods in Cancer Subtyping.\n\nThere are two comparison strategies for the NMI and ARI depending on the availability of true labels of patients. If you upload an empirical pre-determination of subtypes for samples by experts or clinicians based on clinical phenotypes, images or experience, CEPICS will take it as gold standard to compare. If you don’t have any subtype information, CEPICS will calculate NMI and ARI between the results of every two methods for each k, and then calculated the average NMI and ARI for each method at each k",
