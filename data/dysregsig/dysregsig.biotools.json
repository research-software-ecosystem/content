    "description": "DysRegSig is an R package for identifying gene dysregulations and building mechanistic signatures in cancer. DysRegSig is capable of robustly exploring gene dysregulations from high-dimensional expression data with cooperativity and synergy between regulators and several other transcriptional regulation rules taken into consideration. DysRegSig also offers tools to rank dysregulated regulations and TFs, and construct mechanistic signature with gene dysregulations by using genetic algorithm.",

Published by Oxford University Press.SUMMARY: Dysfunctional regulations of gene expression programs relevant to fundamental cell processes can drive carcinogenesis. Therefore, systematically identifying dysregulation events is an effective path for understanding carcinogenesis and provides insightful clues to build predictive signatures with mechanistic interpretability for cancer precision medicine. Here, we implemented a machine learning-based gene dysregulation analysis framework in an R package, DysRegSig, which is capable of exploring gene dysregulations from high-dimensional data and building mechanistic signature based on gene dysregulations. DysRegSig can serve as an easy-to-use tool to facilitate gene dysregulation analysis and follow-up analysis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code and user's guide of DysRegSig are freely available at Github: https://github.com/SCBIT-YYLab/DysRegSig. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
