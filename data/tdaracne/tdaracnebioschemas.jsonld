  "sc:description": "To infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge into bioinformatics research area. In order to detect dependencies between genes at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information theory. The proposed algorithm is expected to be useful in reconstruction of small biological directed networks from time course data.",
