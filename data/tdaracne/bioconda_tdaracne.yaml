description: To infer gene networks from time-series measurements is a current challenge
  into bioinformatics research area. In order to detect dependencies between genes
  at different time delays, we propose an approach to infer gene regulatory networks
  from time-series measurements starting from a well known algorithm based on information
  theory. The proposed algorithm is expected to be useful in reconstruction of small
  biological directed networks from time course data.
