description: "OpenMS is a package for LC/MS data management and analysis. OpenMS offers\
  \ an infrastructure for the development of mass spectrometry-related software and\
  \ powerful 2D and 3D visualization solutions. . TOPP (the OpenMS proteomic pipeline)\
  \ is a pipeline for the analysis of HPLC/MS data. It consists of a set of numerous\
  \ small applications that can be chained together to create analysis pipelines tailored\
  \ for a specific problem. . This package is a metapackage that depends on both the\
  \ libopenms library package (libOpenMS and libOpenMS_GUI) and the OpenMS Proteomic\
