description: OpenMS is a package for LC/MS data management and analysis. OpenMS offers
  an infrastructure for the development of mass spectrometry-related software and
  powerful 2D and 3D visualization solutions. . TOPP (the OpenMS proteomic pipeline)
  is a pipeline for the analysis of HPLC/MS data. It consists of a set of numerous
  small applications that can be chained together to create analysis pipelines tailored
  for a specific problem. . This package is a metapackage that depends on both the
  libopenms library package (libOpenMS and libOpenMS_GUI) and the OpenMS Proteomic
  Pipeline (topp) package.
