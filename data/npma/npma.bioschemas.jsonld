      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Novel Privacy-Preserving Mutual Authentication in TMIS for Mobile Edge-Cloud Architecture | Mobile Edge-Cloud Network is a new network structure after fog-cloud computing, where service and data computing are scattered in the most logical, nearby and efficient place. It provides better services than fog-cloud computing with better performance in reasonably low cost way and allows users to eliminate numerous limitations inherent in fog-cloud computing, although it inherits those security-privacy issues from fog-cloud computing. A novel privacy-preserving mutual authentication in TMIS for mobile Edge-Cloud architecture (abbreviated to NPMA) is constructed in this paper. NPMA scheme not only mitigates some weaknesses of fog-cloud computing, but has other advantages",
