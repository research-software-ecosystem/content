    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'nsLTPs' | Comprehensive classification of the plant non-specific lipid transfer protein superfamily towards its sequence-structure-function analysis | Non-specific lipid transfer protein structure modeling | Theoretical structures have been calculated for the 787 other proteins using the @tome2 suite of programs to perform homology modeling. The quality of each final structure model has been evaluated by a set of several tools including Qmean (Benkert, Tosatto et al. 2008). Structures with low quality (i.e. for which the cysteine scaffold could not be fully modeled) were discarded from further analysis",
