However, as existing image analysis software tools have been developed for diffraction-limited images, they are generally not well suited for quantifying nanoscale structures like dendritic spines. We present SpineJ, a semi-automatic ImageJ plugin that is specifically designed for this purpose. SpineJ comes with an intuitive and user-friendly graphical user interface, facilitating fast, accurate, and unbiased analysis of spine morphology","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/764548","name":"SpineJ"}}
