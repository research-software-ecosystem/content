The framework allows assessing quality of samples with sharp or broad enrichment profiles, whereas previously proposed metrics were not taking this into account. It provides a reference compendium of quality control metrics and trained machine learning models for scoring samples.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIC.html","name":"ChIC","version":["1.0.0"]}}
