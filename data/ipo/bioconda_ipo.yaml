description: The outcome of XCMS data processing strongly depends on the parameter
  settings. IPO (`Isotopologue Parameter Optimization`) is a parameter optimization
  tool that is applicable for different kinds of samples and liquid chromatography
  coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry devices, fast and free of labeling
  steps. IPO uses natural, stable 13C isotopes to calculate a peak picking score.
  Retention time correction is optimized by minimizing the relative retention time
  differences within features and grouping parameters are optimized by maximizing
  the number of features showing exactly one peak from each injection of a pooled
  sample. The different parameter settings are achieved by design of experiment. The
  resulting scores are evaluated using response surface models.
