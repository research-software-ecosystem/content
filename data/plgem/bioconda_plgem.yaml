description: The Power Law Global Error Model (PLGEM) has been shown to faithfully
  model the variance-versus-mean dependence that exists in a variety of genome-wide
  datasets, including microarray and proteomics data. The use of PLGEM has been shown
  to improve the detection of differentially expressed genes or proteins in these
  datasets.
