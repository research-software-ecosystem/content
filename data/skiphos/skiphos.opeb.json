Phosphorylation is known to regulate most cellular processes such as protein synthesis, cell division, signal transduction, cell growth, development and aging. Various phosphorylation site prediction models have been developed, which can be broadly categorized as being kinase-specific or non-kinase specific (general). Unlike the latter, the former requires a large enough number of experimentally known phosphorylation sites annotated with a given kinase for training the model, which is not the case in reality: less than 3% of the phosphorylation sites known to date have been annotated with a responsible kinase","homepage":"http://fit.uet.vnu.edu.vn/SKIPHOS","name":"SKIPHOS"}}
