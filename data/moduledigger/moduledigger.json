A CRM is characterized by a set of co-occurring transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). In silico methods have been developed to search for CRMs by determining the combination of TFBS that are statistically overrepresented in a certain geneset. Most of these methods solve this combinatorial problem by relying on computational intensive optimization methods. As a result their usage is limited to finding CRMs in small datasets (containing a few genes only) and using binding sites for a restricted number of transcription factors (TFs) out of which the optimal module will be selected. Results: We present an itemset mining based strategy for computationally detecting cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in a set of genes. We tested our method by applying it on a large benchmark data set, derived from a ChIP-Chip analysis and compared its performance with other well known cis-regulatory module detection tools. Conclusion: We show that by exploiting the computational efficiency of an itemset mining approach and combining it with a well-designed statistical scoring scheme, we were able to prioritize the biologically valid CRMs in a large set of coregulated genes using binding sites for a large number of potential TFs as input. \u00a9 2009 Sun et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Sun H."}, {"name": "De Bie T."}, {"name": "Storms V."}, {"name": "Fu Q."}, {"name": "Dhollander T."}, {"name": "Lemmens K."}, {"name": "Verstuyf A."}, {"name": "De Moor B."}, {"name": "Marchal K."}], "date": "2009-01-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ugent.be", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kathleen.marchal@intec.ugent.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:moduledigger", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/kmarchal/Supplementary_Information_Sun_2009_ModuleDigger/Index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Nucleic acid sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2977"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence motif (nucleic acid)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2070"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An itemset mining framework for the detection of cis-regulatory modules.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "moduledigger", "additionDate": "2016-05-17T10:18:05Z", "name": "ModuleDigger", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/kmarchal/Supplementary_Information_Sun_2009_ModuleDigger/startPage.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
