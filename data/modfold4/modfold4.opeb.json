To determine the usefulness of 3D models of proteins, they must be assessed in terms of their quality by methods that predict their similarity to the native structure. The ModFOLD4 server is the latest version of our leading independent server for the estimation of both the global and local (per-residue) quality of 3D protein models. The server produces both machine readable and graphical output, providing users with intuitive visual reports on the quality of predicted protein tertiary structures. The ModFOLD4 server is freely available to all at: http://www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/ModFOLD/.","authors":["McGuffin L.J.","Buenavista M.T.","Roche D.B."],"cit_count":68,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23620298","title":"The ModFOLD4 server for the quality assessment of 3D protein models.","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:modfold4","biotoolsID":"modfold4","description":"Webserver for the estimation of both global and local (per-residue) quality of 3D protein models.
