    "description": "Computational prediction of MoRFs based on protein sequences and minimax probability machine.\n\nBACKGROUND:Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are one important type of disordered segments that can promote specific protein-protein interactions. They are located within longer intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to their interaction partners. The functional importance of MoRFs and the limitation of experimental identification make it necessary to predict MoRFs accurately with computational methods. RESULTS:In this study, a new sequence-based method, named as MoRFMPM, is proposed for predicting MoRFs. MoRFMPM uses minimax probability machine (MPM) to predict MoRFs based on 16 features and 3 different windows, which neither relying on other predictors nor calculating the properties of the surrounding regions of MoRFs separately.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MoRFs'",
