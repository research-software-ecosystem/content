    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'katA katB', 'katB' | tRNA m7G46 methyltransferase, plays a role in hydrogen peroxide resistance and positively modulates the translation of katA and katB mRNAs in Pseudomonas aeruginosa | Cellular response to oxidative stress is a crucial mechanism that promotes the survival of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during infection. However, the translational regulation of oxidative stress response remains largely unknown. Here, we reveal a tRNA modification-mediated translational response to H2O2 in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrated that the P. aeruginosa trmB gene encodes a tRNA guanine (46)-N7-methyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of m7G46 in the tRNA variable loop. Twenty-three tRNA substrates of TrmB with a guanosine residue at position 46 were identified, including 11 novel tRNA substrates. We showed that loss of trmB had a strong negative effect on the translation of Phe- and Asp-enriched mRNAs",
