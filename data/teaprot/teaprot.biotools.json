                "abstract": "© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.We have developed the underrepresented post-translational modification (PTM) database (urPTMdb), a PTM gene set database to accelerate the discovery of enriched protein modifications in experimental data. urPTMdb provides curated lists of proteins reported to be substrates of underrepresented modifications. Their enrichment in proteomics datasets can reveal unexpected PTM regulations. urPTMdb can be implemented in existing workflows, or used in TeaProt, an online Shiny tool that integrates upstream transcription factor enrichment analysis with downstream pathway analysis through an easy-to-use interactive interface. TeaProt annotates user-uploaded data with drug−gene interactions, subcellular localizations, phenotypic functions, gene− disease associations, and enzyme−gene interactions. TeaProt enables gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to discover enrichments in gene sets from various resources, including MSigDB, CHEA, and urPTMdb. We demonstrate the utility of urPTMdb and TeaProt through the analysis of a previously published Western diet-induced remodeling of the tongue proteome, which revealed altered cellular processes associated with energy metabolism, interferon alpha/gamma response, adipogenesis, HMGylation substrate enrichment, and transcription regulation through PPARG and CEBPA. Additionally, we analyzed the interactome of ADP-ribose glycohydrolase TARG1, a key enzyme that removes mono-ADP-ribosylation. This analysis identified an enrichment of ADP-ribosylation, ribosomal proteins, and proteins localized in the nucleoli and endoplasmic reticulum. TeaProt and urPTMdb are accessible at https://tea.coffeeprot.com/.",
