Current techniques to determine the individual ploidy, e.g., flow cytometry, chromosome counting or genotyping-by-sequencing, are often cumbersome. Based on the genotypic probabilities for polysomic inheritance under double-reduction, we developed a model to estimate allele frequency and infer the ploidy status of individuals from the allelic phenotypes of codominant genetic markers. The allele frequencies are estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm in the presence of null alleles, false alleles, negative amplifications and self-fertilization, and the posterior probabilities are used to assign individuals into different levels of ploidy. The accuracy of this method under different conditions is evaluated.
