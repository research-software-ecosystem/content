  "sc:description": "A population genetics software computing several summary statistics from populations or groups of populations, and implementing two clustering algorithms to study the genetic structure of populations. It has been specifically developed for the analysis of DNA sequences. The first aim of SPADS is to compute, on real datasets, the summary statistics computed by PhyloGeoSim on each simulated datasets.",
