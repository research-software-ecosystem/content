                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2019.The rise of intact protein analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) was accompanied by an increasing need for flexible tools allowing data visualization and analysis. These include inspection of the deconvoluted molecular weights of the proteoforms eluted alongside liquid chromatography (LC) through their representation in three-dimensional (3D) liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) maps (plots of deconvoluted molecular weights, retention times, and intensity of the MS signal). With this aim, we developed a free and open-source web application named VisioProt-MS (https://masstools.ipbs.fr/mstools/visioprot-ms/). VisioProt-MS is highly compatible with many algorithms and software developed by the community to integrate and deconvolute top-down and intact protein MS data. Its dynamic and user-friendly features greatly facilitate analysis through several graphical representations dedicated to MS and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis of proteoforms in complex samples. Here, we will illustrate the importance of LC-MS map visualization to optimize top-down acquisition/search parameters and analyze intact protein MS data. We will go through the main features of VisioProt-MS using the human proteasomal 20S core particle as a user-case.",
