    "description": "an open source GIS-based model for liveability spatial assessment.\n\nEcosystem Services (ES) and Urban Services (US) influence place liveability in a comparable manner. Consequently, assessing landscape liveability considering both types of services can result effective for landscape planning and policy-making purposes. Since liveability depends also on local population preferences and perceptions, stakeholder involvement results essential for a more coherent liveability assessment. In this study a Spatial Multicriteria Decision Aiding (S-MCDA) approach guided the development of a LIveability Spatial Assessment Model (LISAM). Using a combination of GIS techniques (Euclidean distance, kernel density estimation, network analysis, viewshed analysis), consistent and comparable ES and US spatial indices were calculated in a study area located in central Italy.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'liveability'",
