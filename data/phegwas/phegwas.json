    "description": "A new dimension to visualize GWAS across multiple phenotypes.\n\n3D GWAS across multiple phenotypes.\n\nPheGWAS: Three-dimensional approach to dynamically visualize GWAS across multiple phenotypes.\n\nGWAS is Genome Wide Association Study which is done on many variants and one phenotype. The Manhattan plot is the popular way to visualize this( https://github.com/stephenturner/qqman ). On the other hand, PheWAS (https://rdrr.io/github/PheWAS/PheWAS/ ) is phenome wide association study which is done on a single variant and many phenotypes. PheGWAS is a new concept to do analysis on many variants and many phenotypes. This is a package to do interactive 3D visualization on many variants many phenotypes",
