    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | developing an interactive graph-based visualization for dietary supplement knowledge graph through user-centered design | BACKGROUND:Dietary supplements (DSs) are widely used. However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DSs. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, health information, especially online information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. In our previous work, we prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualization to facilitate consumers' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process. METHODS:Following UCD principles, we carried out two design iterations to enrich the functionalities of ALOHA and enhance its usability",
