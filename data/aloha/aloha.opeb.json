However, consumers know little about the safety and efficacy of DSs. There is a growing interest in accessing health information online; however, health information, especially online information on DSs, is scattered with varying levels of quality. In our previous work, we prototyped a web application, ALOHA, with interactive graph-based visualization to facilitate consumers' browsing of the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) curated from scientific resources, following an iterative user-centered design (UCD) process. METHODS:Following UCD principles, we carried out two design iterations to enrich the functionalities of ALOHA and enhance its usability","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31391091","name":"ALOHA"}}
