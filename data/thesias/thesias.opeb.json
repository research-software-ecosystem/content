In addition to the command line interface, a graphical JAVA interface is now proposed allowing one to run THESIAS in a user-friendly manner. Besides, new functionalities have been added to THESIAS including the possibility to analyze polychotomous phenotype and X-linked polymorphisms. © The Author 2007.

Several works have recently advocated the simultaneous estimation of haplotype frequencies and haplotype effects in order to get a better efficiency in parameter estimation. Most of the available models can deal with a binary or a quantitative phenotype, but none has yet discussed the application of haplotype-based association analysis to a survival outcome. We describe how the recently proposed Stochastic-EM (SEM) algorithm can be applied to estimate haplotype effects in censored data analysis using a standard Cox proportional hazards formulation.
