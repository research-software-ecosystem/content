In addition to the command line interface, a graphical JAVA interface is now proposed allowing one to run THESIAS in a user-friendly manner. Besides, new functionalities have been added to THESIAS including the possibility to analyze polychotomous phenotype and X-linked polymorphisms. \u00a9 The Author 2007.

                "abstract": "It is now widely recognized that haplotype information inferred from genotypes can be of great interest to better characterize the role of a candidate gene in the etiology of a complex trait in the context of association studies. Several works have recently advocated the simultaneous estimation of haplotype frequencies and haplotype effects in order to get a better efficiency in parameter estimation. Most of the available models can deal with a binary or a quantitative phenotype, but none has yet discussed the application of haplotype-based association analysis to a survival outcome. We describe how the recently proposed Stochastic-EM (SEM) algorithm can be applied to estimate haplotype effects in censored data analysis using a standard Cox proportional hazards formulation. This model has been implemented in the THESIAS software freely available at http://www.genecanvas.org. \u00a9 2004 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.",
