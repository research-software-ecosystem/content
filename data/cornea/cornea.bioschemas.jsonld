      "sc:description": "A pipeline to decrypt the inter protein interfaces from amino acid sequence information | Abstract Computational methods have been devised in the past to predict the interface residues using amino acid sequence information but have been majorly applied to predict for prokaryotic protein complexes. Since the composition and rate of evolution of the primary sequence are different between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it is important to develop a method specifically for eukaryotic complexes. Here we report a new hybrid pipeline for the prediction of protein-protein interaction interfaces from the amino acid sequence information alone based on the framework of Co -evolution, machine learning ( R andom forest) and Ne twork A nalysis named CoRNeA trained specifically on eukaryotic protein complexes",
