                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Broman et al.R/qtl2 is an interactive software environment for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in experimental populations. The R/qtl2 software expands the scope of the widely used R/qtl software package to include multiparent populations derived from more than two founder strains, such as the Collaborative Cross and Diversity Outbred mice, heterogeneous stocks, and MAGIC plant populations. R/qtl2 is designed to handle modern high-density genotyping data and high-dimensional molecular phenotypes, including gene expression and proteomics. R/qtl2 includes the ability to perform genome scans using a linear mixed model to account for population structure, and also includes features to impute SNPs based on founder strain genomes and to carry out association mapping. The R/qtl2 software provides all of the basic features needed for QTL mapping, including graphical displays and summary reports, and it can be extended through the creation of add-on packages. R/qtl2, which is free and open source software written in the R and C++ programming languages, comes with a test framework.",
