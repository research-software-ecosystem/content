description: "NextSV is an computational pipeline that allows structural variant (SV)\
  \ calling from PacBio sequencing data using PBhoney and Sniffles. NextSV takes FASTA\
  \ or FASTQ files as input. Once the SV caller is selected by user, NextSV automatically\
  \ chooses the compatible aligner and performs mapping. The alignments will be automatically\
  \ sorted and then presented to the SV caller. Users can change the parameters by\
  \ modifying its configuration file. When the analysis is finished, NextSV will examine\
  \ the FASTA/FASTQ, BAM, and result files and generate a report showing various statistics.\
  \ If more than both callers are selected, NextSV will format the raw result files\
  \ (.tails, .spots, or .vcf files) into bed files and generate the intersection or\
  \ union call set for the purpose of higher accuracy or sensitivity.\n"
