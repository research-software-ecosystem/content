description: NextSV is an computational pipeline that allows structural variant (SV)
  calling from PacBio sequencing data using PBhoney and Sniffles. NextSV takes FASTA
  or FASTQ files as input. Once the SV caller is selected by user, NextSV automatically
  chooses the compatible aligner and performs mapping. The alignments will be automatically
  sorted and then presented to the SV caller. Users can change the parameters by modifying
  its configuration file. When the analysis is finished, NextSV will examine the FASTA/FASTQ,
  BAM, and result files and generate a report showing various statistics. If more
  than both callers are selected, NextSV will format the raw result files (.tails,
  .spots, or .vcf files) into bed files and generate the intersection or union call
  set for the purpose of higher accuracy or sensitivity.
