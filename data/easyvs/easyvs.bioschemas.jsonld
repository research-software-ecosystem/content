With an intuitive interface, the tool allows users to go from selecting a protein target with a know structure and tailoring a purchasable molecule library to performing and visualising docking in a few clicks. Our system also allows users to filter screening libraries based on molecule properties, cluster molecules by similarity and personalise docking parameters.",
