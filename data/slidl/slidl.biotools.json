                "abstract": "The inspection of stained tissue slides by pathologists is essential for the early detection, diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Recently, deep learning methods for the analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) have shown excellent performance on these tasks, and have the potential to substantially reduce the workload of pathologists. However, WSIs present a number of unique challenges for analysis, requiring special consideration of image annotations, slide and image artefacts, and evaluation of WSI-trained model performance. Here we introduce SliDL, a Python library for performing pre- and post-processing of WSIs. SliDL makes WSI data handling easy, allowing users to perform essential processing tasks in a few simple lines of code, bridging the gap between standard image analysis and WSI analysis. We introduce each of the main functionalities within SliDL: from annotation and tile extraction to tissue detection and model evaluation. We also provide ‘code snippets’ to guide the user in running SliDL. SliDL has been designed to interact with PyTorch, one of the most widely used deep learning libraries, allowing seamless integration into deep learning workflows. By providing a framework in which deep learning methods for WSI analysis can be developed and applied, SliDL aims to increase the accessibility of an important application of deep learning.",
