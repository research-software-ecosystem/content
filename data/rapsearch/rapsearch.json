Protein similarity search--a key step to achieve annotation of protein-coding genes in these short reads, and identification of their biological functions--faces daunting challenges because of the very sizes of the short read datasets.Results: We developed a fast protein similarity search tool RAPSearch that utilizes a reduced amino acid alphabet and suffix array to detect seeds of flexible length. For short reads (translated in 6 frames) we tested, RAPSearch achieved ~20-90 times speedup as compared to BLASTX. RAPSearch missed only a small fraction (~1.3-3.2%) of BLASTX similarity hits, but it also discovered additional homologous proteins (~0.3-2.1%) that BLASTX missed. By contrast, BLAT, a tool that is even slightly faster than RAPSearch, had significant loss of sensitivity as compared to RAPSearch and BLAST.Conclusions: RAPSearch is implemented as open-source software and is accessible at http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/mg/RAPSearch. It enables faster protein similarity search. The application of RAPSearch in metageomics has also been demonstrated. \u00a9 2011 Ye et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 56, "authors": [{"name": "Ye Y."}, {"name": "Choi J.-H."}, {"name": "Tang H."}], "date": "2011-05-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yongan Zhao", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yongzhao@indiana.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yuzhen Ye", "url": "http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/yye/lab/index.php", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yye@indiana.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rapsearch", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/mg/RAPSearch2/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast protein similarity search tool for short reads that utilizes a reduced amino acid alphabet and suffix array to detect seeds of flexible length.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "rapsearch", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:16:02Z", "name": "RAPSearch", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/zhaoyanswill/RAPSearch2", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
