  "sc:description": "The package is the R-version of the C-based software \\bold{CASPAR}. It is meant to help predict survival times in the presence of high-dimensional explanatory covariates. The model is a piecewise baseline hazard Cox regression model with an Lq-norm based prior that selects for the most important regression coefficients, and in turn the most relevant covariates for survival analysis.",
