Its underlying index structure is designed to quickly retrieve all occurrences of a tryptic peptide in UniProtKB records. Taxon-specificity of the tryptic peptide is successively derived from these occurrences using a novel lowest common ancestor approach that is robust against taxonomic misarrangements, misidentifications, and inaccuracies. Not taking into account this identification noise would otherwise result in drastic loss of information. Dynamic treemaps visualize the biodiversity of metaproteome samples, which eases the exploration of samples with highly complex compositions. The potential of Unipept to gain novel insights into the biodiversity of a sample is evaluated by reanalyzing publicly available metaproteome data sets taken from the bacterial phyllosphere and the human gut. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","authors":["Mesuere B.","Devreese B.","Debyser G.","Aerts M.","Vandamme P.","Dawyndt P."],"cit_count":54,"doi":"10.1021/pr300576s","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","pmid":"23153116","title":"Unipept: Tryptic peptide-based biodiversity analysis of metaproteome samples","type":"Primary","year":"2012-12-07"},{"abstract":"© 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
