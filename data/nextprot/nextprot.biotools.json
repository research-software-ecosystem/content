This resource contained a wealth of high-quality data on all the human proteins that are produced by the 20'000 protein-coding genes found in the human genome. The content of neXtProt was continuously extended so as to provide many more carefully selected data sets and analysis tools. neXtProt data and tools have been archived.",

Developed at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), it aims to help researchers answer questions relevant to human proteins. To achieve this goal, neXtProt is built on a corpus containing both curated knowledge originating from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot knowledgebase and carefully selected and filtered high-throughput data pertinent to human proteins. This article presents an overview of the database and the data integration process. We also lay out the key future directions of neXtProt that we consider the necessary steps to make neXtProt the one-stop-shop for all research projects focusing on human proteins.

In order to provide comprehensive and up-to-date data, we evaluate and add new data sets. We describe the incorporation of three new data sets that provide expression, function, protein-protein binary interaction, post-translational modifications (PTM) and variant information. New SPARQL query examples illustrating uses of the new data were added. neXtProt has continued to develop tools for proteomics. We have improved the peptide uniqueness checker and have implemented a new protein digestion tool. Together, these tools make it possible to determine which proteases can be used to identify trypsin-resistant proteins by mass spectrometry. In terms of usability, we have finished revamping our web interface and completely rewritten our API. Our SPARQL endpoint now supports federated queries. All the neXtProt data are available via our user interface, API, SPARQL endpoint and FTP site, including the new PEFF 1.0 format files. Finally, the data on our FTP site is now CC BY 4.0 to promote its reuse.",
