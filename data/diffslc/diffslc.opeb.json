The DiffSLC centrality measure predicts central and essential genes and proteins using a protein-protein interaction network. Network centrality measures prioritize nodes and edges based on their importance to the network topology. These measures helped identify critical genes and proteins in biomolecular networks. The proposed centrality measure, DiffSLC, combines the number of interactions of a protein and the gene coexpression values of genes from which those proteins were translated, as a weighting factor to bias the identification of essential proteins in a protein interaction network. Potentially essential proteins with low node degree are promoted through eigenvector centrality. Thus, the gene coexpression values are used in conjunction with the eigenvector of the network’s adjacency matrix and edge clustering coefficient to improve essentiality prediction. The outcome of this prediction is shown using three variations: (1) inclusion or exclusion of gene co-expression data, (2) impact of different coexpression measures, and (3) impact of different gene expression data sets. For a total of seven networks, DiffSLC is compared to other centrality measures using Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction networks and gene expression data. Comparisons are also performed for the top ranked proteins against the known essential genes from the Saccharomyces Gene Deletion Project, which show that DiffSLC detects more essential proteins and has a higher area under the ROC curve than other compared methods. This makes DiffSLC a stronger alternative to other centrality methods for detecting essential genes using a protein-protein interaction network that obeys centrality-lethality principle. DiffSLC is implemented using the igraph package in R, and networkx package in Python. The python package can be obtained from git.io/diffslcpy. The R implementation and code to reproduce the analysis is available via git.io/diffslc.","authors":["Mistry D.","Wise R.P.","Dickerson J.A."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0187091","journal":"PLoS ONE","title":"DiffSLC: A graph centrality method to detect essential proteins of a protein-protein interaction network","type":"Primary","year":"2017-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:diffslc","biotoolsID":"diffslc","description":"Graph centrality method to detect essential proteins of a protein-protein interaction network.","homepage":"https://github.com/divyamistry/diffslc-py","name":"DiffSLC"}}
