Methods: To advance the practical applicability of the smoking-associated methylation signals, we used machine learning methodology to train a classifier for smoking status prediction. Results: We show the prediction performance of our classifier on three independent whole-blood datasets demonstrating its robustness and global applicability. Furthermore, we examine the reasons for biologically meaningful misclassifications through comprehensive phenotypic evaluation. Conclusion: The major contribution of our classifier is its global applicability without a need for users to determine a threshold value for each dataset to predict the smoking status. We provide an R package, EpiSmokEr (Epigenetic Smoking status Estimator), facilitating the use of our classifier to predict smoking status in future studies.","authors":["Bollepalli S.","Korhonen T.","Kaprio J.","Anders S.","Ollikainen M."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.2217/EPI-2019-0206","journal":"Epigenomics","pmid":"31466478","title":"EpiSmokEr: A robust classifier to determine smoking status from DNA methylation data","year":"2019-10-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:EpiSmokEr","biotoolsID":"EpiSmokEr","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | a robust classifier to determine smoking status from DNA methylation data | Aim: Smoking strongly influences DNA methylation, with current and never smokers exhibiting different methylation profiles.
