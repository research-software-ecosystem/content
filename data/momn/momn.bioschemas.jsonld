      "sc:description": "Multi-Objective Matrix Normalization for Fine-grained Visual Recognition.\n\nBilinear pooling achieves great success in fine-grained visual recognition (FGVC). Recent methods have shown that the matrix power normalization can stabilize the second-order information in bilinear features, but some problems, e.g., redundant information and over-fitting, remain to be resolved. In this paper, we propose an efficient Multi-Objective Matrix Normalization (MOMN) method that can simultaneously normalize a bilinear representation in terms of square-root, low-rank, and sparsity. These three regularizers can not only stabilize the second-order information, but also compact the bilinear features and promote model generalization. In MOMN, a core challenge is how to jointly optimize three non-smooth regularizers of different convex properties. To this end, MOMN first formulates them into an augmented Lagrange formula with approximated regularizer constraints",
