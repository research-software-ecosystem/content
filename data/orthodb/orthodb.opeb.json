OrthoDB is a comprehensive catalog of orthologs, genes inherited by extant species from a single gene in their last common ancestor. In 2016 OrthoDB reached its 9th release, growing to over 22 million genes from over 5000 species, now adding plants, archaea and viruses. In this update we focused on usability of this fast-growing wealth of data: updating the user and programmatic interfaces to browse and query the data, and further enhancing the already extensive integration of available gene functional annotations. Collating functional annotations from over 100 resources, and enabled us to propose descriptive titles for 87% of ortholog groups. Additionally, OrthoDB continues to provide computed evolutionary annotations and to allow user queries by sequence homology. The OrthoDB resource now enables users to generate publication-quality comparative genomics charts, as well as to upload, analyze and interactively explore their own private data. OrthoDB is available from http://orthodb.org.","authors":["Zdobnov E.M.","Tegenfeldt F.","Kuznetsov D.","Waterhouse R.M.","Simao F.A.","Ioannidis P.","Seppey M.","Loetscher A.","Kriventseva E.V."],"cit_count":70,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkw1119","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"OrthoDB v9.1: Cataloging evolutionary and functional annotations for animal, fungal, plant, archaeal, bacterial and viral orthologs","type":"Primary","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:orthodb","biotoolsID":"orthodb","description":"Catalog of eukaryotic orthologous protein-coding genes.
