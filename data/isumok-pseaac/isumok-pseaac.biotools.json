                "abstract": "© 2021 Khan et al.Sumoylation is the post-translational modification that is involved in the adaption of the cells and the functional properties of a large number of proteins. Sumoylation has key importance in subcellular concentration, transcriptional synchronization, chromatin remodeling, response to stress, and regulation of mitosis. Sumoylation is associated with developmental defects in many human diseases such as cancer, Huntington’s, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Spin cerebellar ataxia 1, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The covalent bonding of Sumoylation is essential to inheriting part of the operative characteristics of some other proteins. For that reason, the prediction of the Sumoylation site has significance in the scientific community. A novel and efficient technique is proposed to predict the Sumoylation sites in proteins by incorporating Chou’s Pseudo Amino Acid Composition (PseAAC) with statistical moments-based features. The outcomes from the proposed system using 10 fold cross-validation testing are 94.51%, 94.24%, 94.79% and 0.8903% accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. The performance of the proposed system is so far the best in comparison to the other state-of-the-art methods.
