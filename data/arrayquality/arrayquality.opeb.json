The quality metrics assess reproducibility, identify apparent outlier arrays and compute measures of signal-to-noise ratio. The tool handles most current microarray technologies and is amenable to use in automated analysis pipelines or for automatic report generation, as well as for use by individuals. The diagnosis of quality remains, in principle, a context-dependent judgement, but our tool provides powerful, automated, objective and comprehensive instruments on which to base a decision. © 2009 The Author(s).","authors":["Kauffmann A.","Gentleman R.","Huber W."],"cit_count":417,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btn647","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"arrayQualityMetrics - A bioconductor package for quality assessment of microarray data","type":"Primary","year":"2009-02-11"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:arrayquality","biotoolsID":"arrayquality","description":"Functions for performing print-run and array level quality assessment.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/arrayQuality.html","name":"arrayQuality","version":["1.52.0"]}}
