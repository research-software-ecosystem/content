The program computes entropy and rotameric states of dihedrals, clusters multiple conformations and detects dihedral rotations that contribute hinge-like motions. It was developed with special focuses on showing changes of protein flexibility between different states, and selecting representative protein conformations for molecular docking studies.",

Instead of using Cartesian coordinates for protein conformational analysis, T-Analyst is based on internal bond-angle-torsion coordinates in which internal torsion angle movements, such as side-chain rotations, can be easily detected. The program computes entropy and automatically detects and corrects angle periodicity to produce accurate rotameric states of dihedrals. It also clusters multiple conformations and detects dihedral rotations that contribute hinge-like motions. Correlated motions between selected dihedrals can also be observed from the correlation map. T-Analyst focuses on showing changes in protein flexibility between different states and selecting representative protein conformations for molecular docking studies. The program is provided with instructions and full source code in Perl. \u00a9 2010 The Author(s).",
