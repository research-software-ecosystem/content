  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Priism is an image processing, analysis and visualisation application for multidimensional light and electron microscopy data. It uses the Image Visualization Environment (IVE) library, which is a closed-source C library with documented C and FORTRAN APIs. Priism/IVE was developed at UCSF, and can be obtained free of charge by sending an email request to the developers. Many of the same processing and analysis functions available in other image processing applications can be found here (cropping, resizing, spatial filters, Fourier transforms, segmentation etc.), and it includes a comprehensive html-based offline manual. The \"SoftWoRx\" package of GE Healthcare (formerly Applied Precision) was based on Priism/IVE.</p>\r\n",
