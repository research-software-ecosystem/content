      "sc:description": "multi-dimensional NMR analysis software.\n\nXipp (pronounced zip) is an NMR analysis software package created and supported by Dr. Daniel S. Garrett in the lab of Dr. G. Marius Clore. This software package is designed to study labeled proteins and nucleotides and is a complete re-write and extension of the PIPP package using Java. Xipp uses the same file format for Peak-Pick files and assignment tables as was used in PIPP. In addition many of the keyboard and mouse commands are the same as used by PIPP. The primary differences between PIPP and Xipp is that Xipp allows multiple NMR experiments to be viewed and overlayed at same and has built-in ability to aid in backbone assignment. The most important difference is that PIPP is no longer supported while Xipp is actively supported",
