All rights reserved.Summary: We introduce Tibanna, an open-source software tool for automated execution of bioinformatics pipelines on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Tibanna accepts reproducible and portable pipeline standards including Common Workflow Language (CWL), Workflow Description Language (WDL) and Docker. It adopts a strategy of isolation and optimization of individual executions, combined with a serverless scheduling approach. Pipelines are executed and monitored using local commands or the Python Application Programming Interface (API) and cloud configuration is automatically handled. Tibanna is well suited for projects with a range of computational requirements, including those with large and widely fluctuating loads. Notably, it has been used to process terabytes of data for the 4D Nucleome (4DN) Network. Availability and implementation: Source code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
