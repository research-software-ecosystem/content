Let the data speak for itself. Moreover, you will be able to feed prior knowledge of the signatures into the model in a soft thresholding way. No more picking up signature subsets by hand! SigLASSO achieves signature selection by using L1 regularization.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020, The Author(s).Multiple mutational processes drive carcinogenesis, leaving characteristic signatures in tumor genomes. Determining the active signatures from a full repertoire of potential ones helps elucidate mechanisms of cancer development. This involves optimally decomposing the counts of cancer mutations, tabulated according to their trinucleotide context, into a linear combination of known signatures. Here, we develop sigLASSO (a software tool at github.com/gersteinlab/siglasso) to carry out this optimization efficiently. sigLASSO has four key aspects: (1) It jointly optimizes the likelihood of sampling and signature fitting, by explicitly factoring multinomial sampling into the objective function. This is particularly important when mutation counts are low and sampling variance is high (e.g., in exome sequencing). (2) sigLASSO uses L1 regularization to parsimoniously assign signatures, leading to sparse and interpretable solutions. (3) It fine-tunes model complexity, informed by data scale and biological priors. (4) Consequently, sigLASSO can assess model uncertainty and abstain from making assignments in low-confidence contexts.",
