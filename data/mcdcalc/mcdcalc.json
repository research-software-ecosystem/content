    "description": "Markov Chain Molecular Descriptors Calculator for Medicinal Chemistry.\n\nBACKGROUND:Cheminformatics models are able to predict different outputs (activity, property, chemical reactivity) in single molecules or complex molecular systems (catalyzed organic synthesis, metabolic reactions, nanoparticles, etc.). OBJECTIVE:Cheminformatics prediction of complex catalytic enantioselective reactions is a major goal in organic synthesis research and chemical industry. Markov Chain Molecular Descriptors (MCDs) have been largely used to solve Cheminformatics problems. There are different types of Markov chain descriptors such as Markov-Shannon entropies (Shk), Markov Means (Mk), Markov Moments (\u03c0k), etc. However, there are other possible MCDs that have not been used before.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MCDs', 'MCMD-based', 'BACKGROUND:Cheminformatics', 'Cheminformatics'",
