    "description": "Tool developed to interpret gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments by identifying and visualizing the most relevant metabolic pathways associated with a subset of genes (e.g. differentially expressed genes). Enzyme Neighborhood (a sub-network of linked enzymes with a limited path length) allows identification of the most relevant sub-network affected in a gene expression experiment.",

We present an update of PathExpress, a web-based tool to interpret gene-expression data and explore the metabolic network without being restricted to predefined pathways. We define the Enzyme Neighbourhood (EN) as a sub-network of linked enzymes with a limited path length to identify the most relevant sub-networks affected in gene-expression experiments.
