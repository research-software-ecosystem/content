description: PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA, codon and
  amino-acid sequences. It's based on a novel algorithm that treats insertions correctly
  and avoids over-estimation of the number of deletion events. In addition, PRANK
  borrows ideas from maximum likelihood methods used in phylogenetics and correctly
  takes into account the evolutionary distances between sequences. Lastly, PRANK allows
  for defining a potential structure for sequences to be aligned and then, simultaneously
  with the alignment, predicts the locations of structural units in the sequences.
  . PRANK is a command-line program for UNIX-style environments but the same sequence
  alignment engine is implemented in the graphical program PRANKSTER. In addition
  to providing a user-friendly interface to those not familiar with Unix systems,
  PRANKSTER is an alignment browser for alignments saved in the HSAML format. The
  novel format allows for storing all the information generated by the aligner and
  the alignment browser is a convenient way to analyse and manipulate the data. .
  PRANK aims at an evolutionarily correct sequence alignment and often the result
  looks different from ones generated with other alignment methods. There are, however,
  cases where the different look is caused by violations of the method's assumptions.
  To understand why things may go wrong and how to avoid that, read this explanation
  of differences between PRANK and traditional progressive alignment methods.
