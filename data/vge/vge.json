    "description": "a simulated grid engine environment for large-scale supercomputers.\n\nVirtual Grid Engine (VGE) is a kind of middleware for running bioinformatics software pipelines on large-scale supercomputers which do not support any grid engine survices. VGE employs master-worker model. It first reserves processors and/or cores by running the job which is parallelized by MPI, then asign divided small tasks onto its worker processes. VGE is written in python.\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Satoshi ITO, Masaaki YADOME, and Satoru MIYANO.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Virtual Grid Engine'",
