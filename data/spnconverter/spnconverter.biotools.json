                "abstract": "Summary: The signaling Petri net (SPN) simulator, designed to provide insights into the trends of molecules' activity levels in response to an external stimulus, contributes to the systems biology necessity of analyzing the dynamics of large-scale cellular networks. Implemented into the freely available software, BioLayout Express3D, the simulator is publicly available and easy to use, provided the input files are prepared in the GraphML format, typically using the network editing software, yEd, and standards specific to the software. However, analysis of complex networks represented using other systems biology formatting languages (on which popular software, such as CellDesigner and Cytoscape, are based) requires manual manipulation, a step that is prone to error and limits the use of the SPN simulator in BioLayout Express3D. To overcome this, we present a Cytoscape plug-in that enables users to automatically convert networks for analysis with the SPN simulator from the standard systems biology markup language. The automation of this step opens the SPN simulator to a far larger user group than has previously been possible. \u00a9 The Author 2013.",
