Interestingly, one gene locus can generate multiple circRNAs through alternative back-splicing and/or alternative splicing, thus expanding our understanding on the diversity and complexity of transcriptomes. Precise annotation of circRNAs with their alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing events is the basis for the functional characterization of different categories of circRNAs. Here we describe a step-by-step computational scheme to annotate circRNAs from publicly available RNA sequencing datasets with the CIRCexplorer2 pipeline.","authors":["Dong R.","Ma X.-K.","Chen L.-L.","Yang L."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-8808-2_10","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","pmid":"30539552","title":"Genome-wide annotation of circRNAs and their alternative back-splicing/splicing with CIRCexplorer pipeline","type":"Primary","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CIRCexplorer2","biotoolsID":"CIRCexplorer2","description":"Genome-wide annotation of circRNAs and their alternative back-splicing/splicing.","homepage":"https://circexplorer2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","name":"CIRCexplorer2"}}
