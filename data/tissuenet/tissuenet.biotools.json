                "abstract": "Tissue contexts are extremely valuable when studying protein functions and their associated phenotypes. Recently, the study of proteins in tissue contexts was greatly facilitated by the availability of thousands of tissue transcriptomes. To provide access to these data we developed the TissueNet integrative database that displays protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in tissue contexts. Through TissueNet, users can create tissue-sensitive network views of the PPI landscape of query proteins. Unlike other tools, TissueNet output networks highlight tissue-specific and broadly expressed proteins, as well as over- and under-expressed proteins per tissue. The TissueNet v.3 upgrade has a much larger dataset of proteins and PPIs, and represents 125 adult tissues and seven embryonic tissues. Thus, TissueNet provides an extensive, quantitative, and user-friendly interface to study the roles of human proteins in adulthood and embryonic stages. TissueNet v3 is freely available at https://netbio.bgu.ac.il/tissuenet3.",
