It provides command-line and Python interfaces to download pre-built reference genome \"assets\", like indexes used by bioinformatics tools. It can also build assets for custom genome assemblies. Refgenie provides programmatic access to a standard genome folder structure, so software can swap from one genome to another.","homepage":"http://refgenie.databio.org","name":"refgenie"}}
