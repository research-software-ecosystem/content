New technologies are revolutionising biological research and its applications by making it easier and cheaper to generate ever-greater volumes and types of data. In response, the services and infrastructure of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, www.ebi.ac.UK) are continually expanding: total disk capacity increases significantly every year to keep pace with demand (75 petabytes as of December 2015), and interoperability between resources remains a strategic priority. Since 2014 we have launched two new resources: the European Variation Archive for genetic variation data and EMPIAR for two-dimensional electron microscopy data, as well as a Resource Description Framework platform. We also launched the Embassy Cloud service, which allows users to run large analyses in a virtual environment next to EMBL-EBI's vast public data resources.","authors":["Cook C.E.","Bergman M.T.","Finn R.D.","Cochrane G.","Birney E.","Apweiler R."],"cit_count":48,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkv1352","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"The European Bioinformatics Institute in 2016: Data growth and integration","type":"Other","year":"2016-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:relate","biotoolsID":"relate","description":"Search every one of 168,297 protein sequences from 8826 animals, plants and microorganisms and return the protein that contains the closest match to the letters of your sequence.","homepage":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/decode/relate.cgi","name":"reLATE","version":["1"]}}
