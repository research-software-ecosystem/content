New technologies are revolutionising biological research and its applications by making it easier and cheaper to generate ever-greater volumes and types of data. In response, the services and infrastructure of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI, www.ebi.ac.UK) are continually expanding: total disk capacity increases significantly every year to keep pace with demand (75 petabytes as of December 2015), and interoperability between resources remains a strategic priority. Since 2014 we have launched two new resources: the European Variation Archive for genetic variation data and EMPIAR for two-dimensional electron microscopy data, as well as a Resource Description Framework platform. We also launched the Embassy Cloud service, which allows users to run large analyses in a virtual environment next to EMBL-EBI's vast public data resources.", "citationCount": 48, "authors": [{"name": "Cook C.E."}, {"name": "Bergman M.T."}, {"name": "Finn R.D."}, {"name": "Cochrane G."}, {"name": "Birney E."}, {"name": "Apweiler R."}], "date": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "EMBL-EBI", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Training", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "training@ebi.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:relate", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/decode/relate.cgi", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence similarity search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0346"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Search every one of 168,297 protein sequences from 8826 animals, plants and microorganisms and return the protein that contains the closest match to the letters of your sequence.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/support/", "note": null, "type": "Helpdesk"}], "biotoolsID": "relate", "additionDate": "2015-01-29T15:47:50Z", "name": "reLATE", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use", "note": null, "type": "Terms of use"}, {"url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi-bin/decode/relate.cgi", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
