Antigenic epitopes are regions of protein surface that are preferentially recognized by B-cell antibodies . Prediction of antigenic epitopes is useful for the investigation to the mechanism in body self-protection systems and help during the design of vaccine components and immuno-diagnostic reagents.\n\nIn this work, we developed a new method to predict antigenic epitope with lastest sequence input from IEDB database.",
