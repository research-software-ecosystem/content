description: Quantitative DNA sequencing for chromosomal aberrations. The genome is
  divided into non-overlapping fixed-sized bins, number of sequence reads in each
  counted, adjusted with a simultaneous two-dimensional loess correction for sequence
  mappability and GC content, and filtered to remove spurious regions in the genome.
  Downstream steps of segmentation and calling are also implemented via packages DNAcopy
  and CGHcall, respectively.
