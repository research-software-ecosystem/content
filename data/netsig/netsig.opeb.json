We developed a robust statistic (NetSig) that integrates protein interaction networks with data from 4,742 tumor exomes. NetSig can accurately classify known driver genes in 60% of tested tumor types and predicts 62 new driver candidates. Using a quantitative experimental framework to determine in vivo tumorigenic potential in mice, we found that NetSig candidates induce tumors at rates that are comparable to those of known oncogenes and are ten-fold higher than those of random genes. By reanalyzing nine tumor-inducing NetSig candidates in 242 patients with oncogene-negative lung adenocarcinomas, we find that two (AKT2 and TFDP2) are significantly amplified. Our study presents a scalable integrated computational and experimental workflow to expand discovery from cancer genomes.","authors":["Horn H.","Lawrence M.S.","Chouinard C.R.","Shrestha Y.","Hu J.X.","Worstell E.","Shea E.","Ilic N.","Kim E.","Kamburov A.","Kashani A.","Hahn W.C.","Campbell J.D.","Boehm J.S.","Getz G.","Lage K."],"cit_count":6,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4514","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"NetSig: Network-based discovery from cancer genomes","year":"2018-01-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:netsig","biotoolsID":"netsig","description":"A statistic that integrates protein interaction networks with data from tumor exomes","homepage":"http://www.lagelab.org/resources/","name":"NetSig"}}
