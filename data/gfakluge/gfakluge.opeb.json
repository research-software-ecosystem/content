It parses GFA to a set of data structures that represent the encoded graph. You can use these components and their fields/members to build up your own graph representation. You can also convert between GFA 0.1 <-> 1.0 <-> 2.0 to glue programs that use different GFA versions together","homepage":"https://github.com/edawson/gfakluge","name":"gfakluge"}}
