This important database does not provide any programmatic access to the dataset, furthermore no standard relational database interface is provided.Results: interPopula is a Python API to access the HapMap dataset. interPopula provides integration facilities with both the Python ecology of software (e.g. Biopython and matplotlib) and other relevant human population datasets (e.g. Ensembl gene annotation and UCSC Known Genes). A set of guidelines and code examples to address possible inconsistencies across heterogeneous data sources is also provided.Conclusions: interPopula is a straightforward and flexible Python API that facilitates the construction of scripts and applications that require access to the HapMap dataset. © 2010 Antao; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Antao T."],"cit_count":0,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pmid":"21210977","title":"InterPopula: A Python API to access the HapMap Project dataset","year":"2010-12-21"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:interpopula","biotoolsID":"interpopula","description":"Python API to access the HapMap dataset.
