Here we describe an updated application with a new interface and several new features. For example, enrichment analysis can now be performed within multiple gene- and protein-naming systems. This feature avoids potentially serious translation artifacts to which other enrichment analysis strategies are subject. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.
