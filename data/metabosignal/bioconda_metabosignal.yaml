description: MetaboSignal is an R package that allows merging, analyzing and customizing
  metabolic and signaling KEGG pathways. It is a network-based approach designed to
  explore the topological relationship between genes (signaling- or enzymatic-genes)
  and metabolites, representing a powerful tool to investigate the genetic landscape
  and regulatory networks of metabolic phenotypes.
