Published by Oxford University Press. Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Present algorithms typically rely on genomic data to identify miRNAs and require extensive installation procedures. Niche model organisms lacking genomic sequences cannot be analyzed by such tools. Here we introduce the MIRPIPE application enabling rapid and simple browser-based miRNA homology detection and quantification. MIRPIPE features automatic trimming of raw RNA-Seq reads originating from various sequencing instruments, processing of isomiRs and quantification of detected miRNAs versus public- or user-uploaded reference databases.","authors":["Kuenne C.","Preussner J.","Herzog M.","Braun T.","Looso M."],"cit_count":9,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25165094","title":"MIRPIPE: Quantification of microRNAs in niche model organisms","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mirpipe","biotoolsID":"mirpipe","description":"Enables rapid and simple browser-based miRNA homology detection and quantification.","homepage":"https://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de/","name":"MIRPIPE"}}
