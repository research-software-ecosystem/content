  "sc:description": "This library provides capabilities for analysis of mutation properties. Two different analysis approaches are supported: (1) log-linear analysis of neighbourhood base influences on mutation coupled with a sequence logo like representation of influences; (2) log-linear analysis of mutation spectra, the relative proportions of different mutation directioons from a starting base. A logo-like visualisation of the latter is also supported.",
