                "abstract": "A new R software package, RAC, is presented. RAC allows to simulate the rearing cycle of 4 species, finfish and shellfish, highly important in terms of production in the Mediterranean Sea. The package works both at the scale of the individual and of the farmed population. Mathematical models included in RAC were all validated in previous works, and account for growth and metabolism, based on input data characterizing the forcing functions?water temperature, and food quality/quantity. The package provides a demo dataset of forcings for each species, as well as a typical set of husbandry parameters for Mediterranean conditions. The present work illustrates RAC main features, and its current capabilities/limitations. Three test cases are presented as a proof of concept of RAC applicability, and to demonstrate its potential for integrating different open products nowadays provided by remote sensing and operational oceanography.",
