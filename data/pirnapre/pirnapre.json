All rights reserved. Motivation: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that are highly abundant in the germline. One important role of piRNAs is to defend genome integrity by guiding PIWI proteins to silence transposable elements (TEs), which have a high potential to cause deleterious effects on their host. The mechanism of piRNA-mediated post-transcriptional silencing was also observed to affect mRNAs, suggesting that piRNAs might play a broad role in gene expression regulation. However, there has been no systematic report with regard to how many protein-coding genes might be targeted and regulated by piRNAs. Results: We trained a support vector machine classifier based on a combination of Miwi CLIP-Seq-derived features and position-derived features to predict the potential targets of piRNAs on mRNAs in the mouse. Reanalysis of a published microarray dataset suggested that the expression level of the 2587 protein-coding genes predicted as piRNA targets showed significant upregulation as a whole after abolishing the slicer activity of Miwi, supporting the conclusion that they are subject to piRNA-mediated regulation.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Yuan J."}, {"name": "Zhang P."}, {"name": "Cui Y."}, {"name": "Wang J."}, {"name": "Skogerbo G."}, {"name": "Huang D.-W."}, {"name": "Chen R."}, {"name": "He S."}], "date": "2016-04-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "heshunmin@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pirnapre", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.regulatoryrna.org/software/piRNA/piRNA_target_mRNA/index.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "SVM classifier based on a combination of Miwi CLIP-Seq derived features and position derived features to predict potential targets of piRNAs on mRNAs.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pirnapre-pirna-targets-on-mrnas-in-mouse.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "pirnapre", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:07:53Z", "name": "pirnaPre", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.regulatoryrna.org/software/piRNA/piRNA_target_mRNA/index.php#inst", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
