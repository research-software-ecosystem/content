    "description": "A Software to Explore Reactivity and Electronic Structure in Large Biomolecules.\n\nPRIMoRDiA ( PRIMoRDiA Macromolecular Reactivity Descriptors Access ) is a shared memory parallel software written in C++ for post electronic structure calculations, that efficiently reads output files from most used quantum mechanics packages, storing molecular information and processing it to generate several descriptors to evaluate the global and local reactivity of molecular systems. PRIMoRDiA supports the main reactivity descriptors of the Conceptual Density Functional Theory, the most famous and used reactivity theory, which works from response variables of the electronic structure of the molecules, as also other electrostatics properties.",

Reactivity descriptors, theoretical quantities generated from resolved electronic structure, provide a way to predict and rationalize chemical processes of such systems. In this Application Note, we present PRIMoRDiA (PRIMoRDiA Macromolecular Reactivity Descriptors Access), a software built to calculate the reactivity descriptors of large biosystems by employing an efficient and accurate treatment of the large output files produced by quantum chemistry packages. Here, we show the general implementation details and the software main features. Calculated descriptors were applied for a set of enzymatic systems in order to show their relevance for biological studies and the software potential for use in large scale. Also, we test PRIMoRDiA to aid in the interaction depiction between the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and a potential inhibitor.",
