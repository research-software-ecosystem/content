      "sc:description": "A Software to Explore Reactivity and Electronic Structure in Large Biomolecules.\n\nPRIMoRDiA ( PRIMoRDiA Macromolecular Reactivity Descriptors Access ) is a shared memory parallel software written in C++ for post electronic structure calculations, that efficiently reads output files from most used quantum mechanics packages, storing molecular information and processing it to generate several descriptors to evaluate the global and local reactivity of molecular systems. PRIMoRDiA supports the main reactivity descriptors of the Conceptual Density Functional Theory, the most famous and used reactivity theory, which works from response variables of the electronic structure of the molecules, as also other electrostatics properties.",
