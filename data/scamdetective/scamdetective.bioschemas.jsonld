      "sc:description": "Accurate Predictor of Small, Colloidally Aggregating Molecules.\n\nSCAM Detective is a machine learning application and web portal (https://scamdetective.mml.unc.edu/) to identify putative Small Colloidally Aggregating Molecules (SCAMs) in chemical libraries used in high-throughput screening (HTS). SCAM Detective models were developed to predict, with high accuracy, the detergent-sensitive aggregation of compounds in AmpC β-lactamase and cruzain inhibition assays, the preferred counter-screens used widely to identify false positives in the HTS campaigns.\n\nThe SCAM Detective provides an alternative method for assessing the potential of chemicals to be putative aggregators and cause false-positive readouts in bioassays.\n\nThe SCAM Detective application provides an alternative method for assessing the potential of chemicals to be putative aggregators and cause false-positive readouts in bioassays.",
