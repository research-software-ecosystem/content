High-throughput metagenomic and transcriptomic projects have fueled discovery of a number of new microbial associations. Consequently, a plethora of information is being added routinely to biomedical literature, thereby contributing toward enhancing our knowledge on microbial associations. In this communication, we present a tool called \u201cEviMass\u201d (Evidence based mining of human Microbial Associations), which can assist biologists to validate their predicted hypotheses from new microbiome studies. Users can interactively query the processed back-end database for microbe\u2013microbe and disease\u2013microbe associations. The EviMass tool can also be used to upload microbial association networks generated from a human \u201cdisease\u2013control\u201d microbiome study and validate the associations from biomedical literature. Additionally, a list of differentially abundant microbes for the corresponding disease can be queried in the tool for reported evidences. The results are presented as graphical plots, tabulated summary, and other evidence statistics. EviMass is a comprehensive platform and is expected to enable microbiome researchers not only in mining microbial associations, but also enriching a new research hypothesis. The tool is available free for academic use at https://web.rniapps.net/evimass.",
