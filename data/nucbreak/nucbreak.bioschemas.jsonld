      "sc:description": "Location of structural errors in a genome assembly by using paired-end Illumina reads.\n\nNucBreak detects structural errors in assemblies and structural variants between pairs of genomes when only a genome of one organism and Illumina paired-end reads from another organism are available. It is able to detect insertions, deletions, different inter- and intra-chromosomal translocations, and inversions. However, the types of detected breakpoints are not specified. It was written in Python and uses Bowtie2 for reads alignment. The tool is described in the manuscript mentioned in Section 5.",
