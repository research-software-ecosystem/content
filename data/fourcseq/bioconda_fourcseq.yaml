description: FourCSeq is an R package dedicated to the analysis of (multiplexed) 4C
  sequencing data. The package provides a pipeline to detect specific interactions
  between DNA elements and identify differential interactions between conditions.
  The statistical analysis in R starts with individual bam files for each sample as
  inputs. To obtain these files, the package contains a python script (extdata/python/demultiplex.py)
  to demultiplex libraries and trim off primer sequences. With a standard alignment
  software the required bam files can be then be generated.
