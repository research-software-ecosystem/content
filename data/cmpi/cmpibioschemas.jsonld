  "sc:description": "CmPI (CELLmicrocosmos 4.2 PathwayIntegration) is a Java-based 3D software which can be used to map 3D pathways - such as metabolic networks, Protein-Protein interaction networks, etc. - onto a virtual cell model. For this purpose, a database is queried in the background using protein/gene identifiers as input. The user can chose between different localization information by using an interactive table or linked bar charts with different categories. Cell environments can be explored in 3D in different navigation modes. Also, stereoscopic rendering is supported.",
