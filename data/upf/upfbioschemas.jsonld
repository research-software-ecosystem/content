  "sc:description": "The standalone tool UPF offers the possibility for a highly efficient and simple detection of unique peptides. In a first step a SQL-based database of theoretically digested peptides from a given FASTA formatted protein database is generated by choosing a protease. In a second step, in silico generated peptides from a pre-defined protein sequence are compared to this peptide database in order to identify unique peptides.",
