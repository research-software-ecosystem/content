Advances in protocols and sequencing technology have made it possible to obtain high-coverage genomewide sequencing data from blood samples and blood spots taken in the field. However, analyzing and interpreting such data is challenging because of the high rate of multiple infections present. Results: We have developed a statistical method and implementation for deconvolving multiple genome sequences present in an individual with mixed infections. The software package DEploid uses haplotype structure within a reference panel of clonal isolates as a prior for haplotypes present in a given sample. It estimates the number of strains, their relative proportions and the haplotypes presented in a sample, allowing researchers to study multiple infection in malaria with an unprecedented level of detail.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Zhu S.J."}, {"name": "Almagro-Garcia J."}, {"name": "McVean G."}], "date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Sha Joe Zhu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "joe.zhu@bdi.ox.ac.uk"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Gil McVean", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gil.mcvean@bdi.ox.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:deploid", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/mcveanlab/DEploid", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Deconvolution", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3629"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Deconvolution of multiple infections in Plasmodium falciparum from high throughput sequencing data .", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "deploid", "additionDate": "2018-06-18T18:07:36Z", "name": "DEploid", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://deploid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
