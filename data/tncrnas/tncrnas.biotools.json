                "abstract": "© 2021 The Author(s)The emergence of distinct classes of non-coding RNAs has led to better insights into the eukaryotic gene regulatory networks. Amongst them, the existence of transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived non-coding RNAs (tncRNAs) demands exploration in the plant kingdom. We have designed a methodology to uncover the entire perspective of tncRNAome in plants. Using this pipeline, we have identified diverse tncRNAs with a size ranging from 14 to 50 nucleotides (nt) by utilizing 2448 small RNA-seq samples from six angiosperms, and studied their various features, including length, codon-usage, cleavage pattern, and modified tRNA nucleosides. Codon-dependent generation of tncRNAs suggests that the tRNA cleavage is highly specific rather than random tRNA degradation. The nucleotide composition analysis of tncRNA cleavage positions indicates that they are generated through precise endoribonucleolytic cleavage machinery. Certain nucleoside modifications detected on tncRNAs were found to be conserved across the plants, and hence may influence tRNA cleavage, as well as tncRNA functions. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that common tncRNA targets are majorly enriched during metabolic and developmental processes. Further distinct tissue-specific tncRNA clusters highlight their role in plant development. Significant number of tncRNAs differentially expressed under abiotic and biotic stresses highlights their potential role in stress resistance. In summary, this study has developed a platform that will help in the understanding of tncRNAs and their involvement in growth, development, and response to various stresses.
