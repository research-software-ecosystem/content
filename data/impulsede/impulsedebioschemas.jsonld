  "sc:description": "This tool captures single impulse-like patterns in high throughput time series datasets. By fitting a representative impulse model to each gene, it reports differentially expressed genes whether across time points in a single experiment or between two time courses from two experiments. To optimize the running time, the code makes use of clustering steps and multi-threading.",
