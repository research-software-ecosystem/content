By fitting a representative impulse model to each gene, it reports differentially expressed genes whether across time points in a single experiment or between two time courses from two experiments. To optimize the running time, the code makes use of clustering steps and multi-threading.",

Perturbations in the environment lead to distinctive gene expression changes within a cell. Observed over time, those variations can be characterized by single impulse-like progression patterns. ImpulseDE is an R package suited to capture these patterns in high throughput time series datasets. By fitting a representative impulse model to each gene, it reports differentially expressed genes across time points from a single or between two time courses from two experiments. To optimize running time, the code uses clustering and multi-threading. By applying ImpulseDE, wedemon- strate its power to represent underlying biology of gene expression in microarray and RNA-Seq data.",
