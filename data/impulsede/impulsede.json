Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Perturbations in the environment lead to distinctive gene expression changes within a cell. Observed over time, those variations can be characterized by single impulse-like progression patterns. ImpulseDE is an R package suited to capture these patterns in high throughput time series datasets. By fitting a representative impulse model to each gene, it reports differentially expressed genes across time points from a single or between two time courses from two experiments. To optimize running time, the code uses clustering and multi-threading. By applying ImpulseDE, wedemon- strate its power to represent underlying biology of gene expression in microarray and RNA-Seq data.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Sander J."}, {"name": "Schultze J.L."}, {"name": "Yosef N."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jil Sander", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jil.sander@uni-bonn.de"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Nir Yosef", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "niryosef@berkeley.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:impulsede", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.0.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ImpulseDE.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool captures single impulse-like patterns in high throughput time series datasets.
