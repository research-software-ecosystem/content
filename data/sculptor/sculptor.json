Sculptor features extensive special purpose visualization techniques that are based on modern GPU programming and are capable of representing complex molecular assemblies in real-time. The integration of graphics and modeling offers several advantages. The user interface not only eases the usually steep learning curve of pure algorithmic techniques, but it also permits instant analysis and post-processing of results, as well as the integration of results from external software. Here, we implemented an interactive peak-selection strategy that enables the user to explore a preliminary score landscape generated by the colores tool of Situs. The interactive placement of components, one at a time, is advantageous for low-resolution or ambiguously shaped maps, which are sometimes difficult to interpret by the fully automatic peak selection of colores. For the subsequent refinement of the preliminary models resulting from both interactive and automatic peak selection, we have implemented a novel simultaneous multi-body docking in Sculptor and Situs that softly enforces shape complementarities between components using the normalization of the cross-correlation coefficient. The proposed techniques are freely available in Situs version 2.6 and Sculptor version 2.0. \u00a9 2010.", "citationCount": 59, "authors": [{"name": "Birmanns S."}, {"name": "Rusu M."}, {"name": "Wriggers W."}], "date": "2011-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Structural Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.biomachina.org", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sculptor", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.1.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sculptor.biomachina.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Structure visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0570"}, {"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Processing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Editing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3096"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Rendering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-26T14:11:30Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Interactive multi-resolution docking and visualization program for low-resolution density maps and atomic structures.
