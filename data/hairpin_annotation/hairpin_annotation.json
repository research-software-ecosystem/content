Advances in next generation sequencing technologies are producing increasingly large numbers of sRNA reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. However, many bioinformatics tools do not scale accordingly, are cumbersome, or require extensive support from bioinformatics experts. Therefore, researchers need user-friendly, robust tools, capable of not only processing large sRNA datasets in a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive fashion and visualizing sRNA genomic features. Herein, we present the UEA sRNA workbench, a suite of tools that is a successor to the web-based UEA sRNA Toolkit, but in downloadable format and with several enhanced and additional features.", "citationCount": 151, "authors": [{"name": "Stocks M.B."}, {"name": "Moxon S."}, {"name": "Mapleson D."}, {"name": "Woolfenden H.C."}, {"name": "Mohorianu I."}, {"name": "Folkes L."}, {"name": "Schwach F."}, {"name": "Dalmay T."}, {"name": "Moulton V."}], "date": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Forum", "url": "http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hairpin_annotation", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0278"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Generates a secondary structure from an RNA sequence and highlights regions of interest using RNAplot", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "hairpin_annotation", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:15:00Z", "name": "RNA Folding Annotation", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/rnafolding-annotation/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
