                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Smoking is one of the most important factors associated with the development of lung cancer. However, the signaling pathways and driver genes in smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma remain unknown. The present study analyzed 433 samples of smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma and 75 samples of non-smoking lung adenocarcinoma from the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the ggplot2 R/Bioconductor package. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was performed using the R packages RSQLite and org-Hs-eg-db. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to screen factors associated with patient survival. Kaplan-Meier and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyze the potential clinical significance of the identified biomarkers as molecular prognostic markers for the five-year overall survival time. A total of 373 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; |log2-fold change|\u22652.0 and P<0.01) were identified, of which 71 were downregulated and 302 were upregulated. These DEGs were associated with 28 significant GO functions and 11 significant KEGG pathways (false discovery rate <0.05). Two hundred thirty-eight proteins were associated with the 373 differentially expressed genes, and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that 7 mRNAs, cytochrome P450 family 17 subfamily A member 1, PKHD1 like 1, retinoid isomerohydrolase RPE65, neurotensin receptor 1, fetuin B, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit, significantly distinguished between non-smoking and smoking-associated adenocarcinomas. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients in the 7 mRNAs-high-risk group had a significantly worse prognosis than those of the low-risk group. The data obtained in the current study suggested that these genes may serve as potential novel prognostic biomarkers of smoking-associated lung adenocarcinoma.",
