In this paper we introduce a web-based public tool, ChemGPS-NPWeb (http://chemgps.bmc.uu.se), for comprehensive chemical space navigation and exploration in terms of global mapping onto a consistent, eight dimensional map over structure derived physico-chemical characteristics. ChemGPS-NPWeb can assist in compound selection and prioritization; property description and interpretation; cluster analysis and neighbourhood mapping; as well as comparison and characterization of large compound datasets. By using ChemGPS-NPWeb, researchers can analyze and compare chemical libraries in a consistent manner. In this study it is demonstrated how ChemGPS-NPWeb can assist in interpreting results from two large datasets tested for activity in biological assays for pyruvate kinase and Bcl-2 family related protein interactions, respectively. Furthermore, a more than 30-year-old suggestion of \"chemical similarity\" between the natural pigments betalains and muscaflavins is tested. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","authors":["Rosen J.","Lovgren A.","Kogej T.","Muresan S.","Gottfries J.","Backlund A."],"cit_count":63,"doi":"10.1007/s10822-008-9255-y","journal":"Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design","title":"ChemGPS-NPWeb: Chemical space navigation online","type":"Primary","year":"2009-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:chemgps-np","biotoolsID":"chemgps-np","description":"A tool tuned for navigation in biologically relevant chemical space.","homepage":"http://chemgps.bmc.uu.se/","name":"ChemGPS-NP","version":["1"]}}
