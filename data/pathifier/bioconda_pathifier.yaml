biotools_id: pathifier
description: Pathifier is an algorithm that infers pathway deregulation scores for
  each tumor sample on the basis of expression data. This score is determined, in
  a context-specific manner, for every particular dataset and type of cancer that
  is being investigated. The algorithm transforms gene-level information into pathway-level
  information, generating a compact and biologically relevant representation of each
  sample.
