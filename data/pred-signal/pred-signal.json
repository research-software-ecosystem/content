                "abstract": "Computational prediction of signal peptides (SPs) and their cleavage sites is of great importance in computational biology; however, currently there is no available method capable of predicting reliably the SPs of archaea, due to the limited amount of experimentally verified proteins with SPs. We performed an extensive literature search in order to identify archaeal proteins having experimentally verified SP and managed to find 69 such proteins, the largest number ever reported. A detailed analysis of these sequences revealed some unique features of the SPs of archaea, such as the unique amino acid composition of the hydrophobic region with a higher than expected occurrence of isoleucine, and a cleavage site resembling more the sequences of gram-positives with almost equal amounts of alanine and valine at the position-3 before the cleavage site and a dominant alanine at position-1, followed in abundance by serine and glycine. Using these proteins as a training set, we trained a hidden Markov model method that predicts the presence of the SPs and their cleavage sites and also discriminates such proteins from cytoplasmic and transmembrane ones. The method performs satisfactorily, yielding a 35-fold cross-validation procedure, a sensitivity of 100% and specificity 98.41% with the Matthews' correlation coefficient being equal to 0.964. This particular method is currently the only available method for the prediction of secretory SPs in archaea, and performs consistently and significantly better compared with other available predictors that were trained on sequences of eukaryotic or bacterial origin. Searching 48 completely sequenced archaeal genomes we identified 9437 putative SPs. The method, PRED-SIGNAL, and the results are freely available for academic users at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/PRED-SIGNAL/ and we anticipate that it will be a valuable tool for the computational analysis of archaeal genomes. \u00a9 The Author 2008.
