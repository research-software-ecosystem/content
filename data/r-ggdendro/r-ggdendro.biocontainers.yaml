description: This is a set of tools for dendrograms and tree plots using 'ggplot2'.  The
  'ggplot2' philosophy is to clearly separate data from the presentation. Unfortunately
  the plot method for dendrograms plots directly to a plot device without exposing
  the data. The 'ggdendro' package resolves this by making available functions that
  extract the dendrogram plot data. The package  provides implementations for tree,
  rpart, as well as diana and agnes cluster diagrams.
