      "sc:description": "Gene-Focused Networks Underlying Phenotypic Convergence in a Systematically Phenotyped Cohort With Heterogeneous Intellectual Disability.\n\nThe broad spectrum of intellectual disability (ID) patients' clinical manifestations, the heterogeneity of ID genetic variation, and the diversity of the phenotypic variation represent major challenges for ID diagnosis. By exploiting a manually curated systematic phenotyping cohort of 3803 patients harboring ID, we identified 704 pathogenic genes, 3848 pathogenic sites, and 2075 standard phenotypes for underlying molecular perturbations and their phenotypic impact. We found the positive correlation between the number of phenotypes and that of patients that revealed their extreme heterogeneities, and the relative contribution of multiple determinants to the heterogeneity of ID phenotypes",
