                "abstract": "The BRENDA enzyme database (www.brenda-enzymes.org), recently appointed ELIXIR Core Data Resource, is the main enzyme and enzyme-ligand information system. The core database provides a comprehensive overview on enzymes. A collection of 4.3 million data for ∼84 000 enzymes manually evaluated and extracted from ∼140 000 primary literature references is combined with information obtained by text and data mining, data integration and prediction algorithms. Supplements comprise disease-related data, protein sequences, 3D structures, predicted enzyme locations and genome annotations. Major developments are a revised ligand summary page and the structure search now including a similarity and isomer search. BKMS-react, an integrated database containing known enzyme-catalyzed reactions, is supplemented with further reactions and improved access to pathway connections. In addition to existing enzyme word maps with graphical information of enzyme specific terms, plant word maps have been developed. They show a graphical overview of terms, e.g. enzyme or plant pathogen information, connected to specific plants. An organism summary page showing all relevant information, e.g. taxonomy and synonyms linked to enzyme data, was implemented. Based on a decision by the IUBMB enzyme task force the enzyme class EC 7 has been established for 'translocases-, enzymes that catalyze a transport of ions or metabolites across cellular membranes.",

                "abstract": "Background: The systematic, complete and correct reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks or metabolic pathways is one of the most challenging tasks in systems biology research. An essential requirement is the access to the complete biochemical knowledge - especially on the biochemical reactions. This knowledge is extracted from the scientific literature and collected in biological databases. Since the available databases differ in the number of biochemical reactions and the annotation of the reactions, an integrated knowledge resource would be of great value. Results: We developed a comprehensive non-redundant reaction database containing known enzyme-catalyzed and spontaneous reactions. Currently, it comprises 18,172 unique biochemical reactions. As source databases the biochemical databases BRENDA, KEGG, and MetaCyc were used. Reactions of these databases were matched and integrated by aligning substrates and products. For the latter a two-step comparison using their structures (via InChIs) and names was performed. Each biochemical reaction given as a reaction equation occurring in at least one of the databases was included. Conclusions: An integrated non-redundant reaction database has been developed and is made available to users. The database can significantly facilitate and accelerate the construction of accurate biochemical models. © 2011 Lang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
