      "sc:description": "Transfer learning improves antibiotic resistance class prediction.\n\nTRansfer Learning for Antibiotic Resistance Gene Classification (TRAC) is a neural network based method to predict antibiotic resistance genes. Unlike traditional alignment based approaches such as BLAST or HMMER, TRAC uses an alignment free approach. We show in our upcoming paper that performance of TRAC is better than the alignment based approaches.",
