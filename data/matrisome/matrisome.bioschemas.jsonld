      "sc:description": "In-silico definition of the Drosophila melanogaster matrisome.\n\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) is an assembly of hundreds of proteins that structurally supports the cells it surrounds and biochemically regulates their functions. <i>Drosophila melanogaster< i> has emerged as a powerful model organism to study fundamental mechanisms underlying ECM protein secretion, ECM assembly, and ECM roles in pathophysiological processes. However, as of today, we do not possess a well-defined list of the components forming the ECM of this organism. We previously reported the development of computational pipelines to define the matrisome - the ensemble of genes encoding ECM and ECM-associated proteins - of humans, mice, zebrafish and <i>C. elegans< i>",
