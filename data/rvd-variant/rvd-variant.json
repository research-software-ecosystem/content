Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Next-generation sequencing technology is increasingly being used for clinical diagnostic tests. Clinical samples are often genomically heterogeneous due to low sample purity or the presence of genetic subpopulations. Therefore, a variant calling algorithm for calling low-frequency polymorphisms in heterogeneous samples is needed. Results: We present a novel variant calling algorithm that uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate allele frequency and call variants in heterogeneous samples. We show that our algorithm improves upon current classifiers and has higher sensitivity and specificity over a wide range of median read depth and minor allele fraction. We apply our model and identify 15 mutated loci in the PAXP1 gene in a matched clinical breast ductal carcinoma tumor sample; two of which are likely loss-of-heterozygosity events.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "He Y."}, {"name": "Zhang F."}, {"name": "Flaherty P."}], "date": "2015-02-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://genomics.wpi.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "pjflaherty@wpi.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rvd-variant", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://genomics.wpi.edu/rvd2/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Variant calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3227"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An ultra-sensitive variant detection model for low-depth targeted next-generation sequencing data.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/rvd-hierarchical-bayesian-model-to-detect-rare-single-nucleotide-variants.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "rvd-variant", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:58:18Z", "name": "RVD", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://genomics.wpi.edu/rvd2/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
