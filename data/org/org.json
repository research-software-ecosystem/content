    "description": "Genome-wide mutation profiling and related risk signature for prognosis of papillary renal cell carcinoma.\n\nBackground:The papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma with limited investigation. Our study aimed to explore a robust signature to predict the prognosis of pRCC from the perspective of mutation profiles. Methods:In this study, we downloaded the simple nucleotide variation data of 288 pRCC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. \"GenVisR\" package was utilized to visualize gene mutation profiles in pRCC. The PPI network was conducted based on the STRING database and the modification was performed via Cytoscape software (Version 3.7.1). Top 50 mutant genes were selected and Cox regression method was conducted to identify the hub prognostic mutant signature in pRCC using \"survival\" package.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'pRCC', 'GenVisR' (bio.tools/genvisr)",
