Background: Comparative epigenomic analysis across multiple genes presents a bottleneck for bench biologists working with NGS data. Despite the development of standardized peak analysis algorithms, the identification of novel epigenetic patterns and their visualization across gene subsets remains a challenge. Results: We developed a fast and interactive web app, C-State (Chromatin-State), to query and plot chromatin landscapes across multiple loci and cell types. C-State has an interactive, JavaScript-based graphical user interface and runs locally in modern web browsers that are pre-installed on all computers, thus eliminating the need for cumbersome data transfer, pre-processing and prior programming knowledge. Conclusions: C-State is unique in its ability to extract and analyze multi-gene epigenetic information. It allows for powerful GUI-based pattern searching and visualization. We include a case study to demonstrate its potential for identifying user-defined epigenetic trends in context of gene expression profiles.","authors":["Sowpati D.T.","Srivastava S.","Dhawan J.","Mishra R.K."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1186/s12859-017-1786-6","journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","title":"C-State: An interactive web app for simultaneous multi-gene visualization and comparative epigenetic pattern search","type":"Primary","year":"2017-09-13"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:c-state","biotoolsID":"c-state","description":"Webapp written using Vue and d3.js for epigenetic data visualization by biologists.","homepage":"http://www.ccmb.res.in/rakeshmishra/c-state/","name":"C-state"}}
