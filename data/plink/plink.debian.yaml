summary: whole-genome association analysis toolset
description: >
   plink expects as input the data from SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)
   chips of many individuals and their phenotypical description of a disease.
   It finds associations of single or pairs of DNA variations with a phenotype
   and can retrieve SNP annotation from an online source.
   .
   SNPs can evaluated individually or as pairs for their association with the
   disease phenotypes. The joint investigation of copy number variations is
   supported. A variety of statistical tests have been implemented.
   .
   plink1.9 is a comprehensive update of plink with new algorithms and new
   methods, faster and less memory consumer than the first plink.
   .
   Please note: The executable was renamed to plink1.9
   because of a name clash.  Please read more about this
   in /usr/share/doc/plink1.9/README.Debian.
