description: "plink expects as input the data from SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism)\
  \ chips of many individuals and their phenotypical description of a disease. It\
  \ finds associations of single or pairs of DNA variations with a phenotype and can\
  \ retrieve SNP annotation from an online source. . SNPs can evaluated individually\
  \ or as pairs for their association with the disease phenotypes. The joint investigation\
  \ of copy number variations is supported. A variety of statistical tests have been\
  \ implemented. . plink1.9 is a comprehensive update of plink with new algorithms\
  \ and new methods, faster and less memory consumer than the first plink. . Please\
  \ note: The executable was renamed to plink1.9 because of a name clash.  Please\
  \ read more about this in /usr/share/doc/plink1.9/README.Debian.\n"
