The user assigns taxa to putative species and the plugin computes statistics relating to the probability of the observed monophyly or exclusivity having occurred by chance in a coalescent process. It also assesses the within and between species genetic distances to infer the probability with which members of a putative species might be identified successfully with tree-based methods. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","authors":["Masters B.C.","Fan V.","Ross H.A."],"cit_count":124,"journal":"Molecular Ecology Resources","pmid":"21429114","title":"Species delimitation-a geneious plugin for the exploration of species boundaries","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:species_delimitation","biotoolsID":"species_delimitation","description":"This plugin for the Geneious bioinformatics software is an exploratory tool that allows users to assess putative species in phylogenetic trees.","homepage":"http://www.fos.auckland.ac.nz/~howardross/software.html","name":"Species Delimitation"}}
