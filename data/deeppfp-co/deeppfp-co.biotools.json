                "abstract": "IEEEThe understanding of protein functions is critical to many biological problems such as the development of new drugs and new crops. To reduce the huge gap between the increase of protein sequences and annotations of protein functions, many methods have been proposed to deal with this problem. These methods use Gene Ontology (GO) to classify the functions of proteins and consider one GO term as a class label. However, they ignore the co-occurrence of GO terms that is helpful for protein function prediction. We propose a new deep learning model, named DeepPFP-CO, which uses Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to explore and capture the co-occurrence of GO terms to improve the protein function prediction performance. In this way, we can further deduce the protein functions by fusing the predicted propensity of the center function and its co-occurrence functions. We use Fmax and AUPR to evaluate the performance of DeepPFP-CO and compare DeepPFP-CO with state-of-the-art methods such as DeepGOPlus and DeepGOA. The computational results show that DeepPFP-CO outperforms DeepGOPlus and other methods. Moreover, we further analyze our model at the protein level. The results have demonstrated that DeepPFP-CO improves the performance of protein function prediction. DeepPFP-CO is available at https://csuligroup.com/DeepPFP/.",
