Called WHAT IF, it provides an intelligent and flexible environment for displaying, manipulating, and analyzing small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, and their interactions. A relational protein structure database is incorporated to be queried. The program is suitable for most common crystallographic work. The menu-driven operation of WHAT IF, combined with the use of default values wherever user input is required, makes it very easy to use for a novice user while keeping full flexibility for more sophisticated studies. Although there are not too many unique features in WHAT IF, the fact that everything is integrated in one program makes it a unique tool for many purposes. \u00a9 1990.", "citationCount": 3032, "authors": [{"name": "Vriend G."}], "date": "1990-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Molecular Graphics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "Instruct", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ccisb@stfc.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:whatif", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/whatif/", "function": [{"note": "A molecular modelling package that is specialized on working with proteins and the molecules in their environment like water, ligands, nucleic acids, etc.", "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0477"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A molecular modelling package that is specialized on working with proteins and the molecules in their environment like water, ligands, nucleic acids, etc.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "whatif", "additionDate": "2015-02-16T10:06:12Z", "name": "WHATIF", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://swift.cmbi.ru.nl/teach/WHATIF/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
