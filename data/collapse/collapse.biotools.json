                "abstract": "The identification and characterization of the structural sites which contribute to protein function are crucial for understanding biological mechanisms, evaluating disease risk, and developing targeted therapies. However, the quantity of known protein structures is rapidly outpacing our ability to functionally annotate them. Existing methods for function prediction either do not operate on local sites, suffer from high false positive or false negative rates, or require large site-specific training datasets, necessitating the development of new computational methods for annotating functional sites at scale. We present COLLAPSE (Compressed Latents Learned from Aligned Protein Structural Environments), a framework for learning deep representations of protein sites. COLLAPSE operates directly on the 3D positions of atoms surrounding a site and uses evolutionary relationships between homologous proteins as a self-supervision signal, enabling learned embeddings to implicitly capture structure–function relationships within each site. Our representations generalize across disparate tasks in a transfer learning context, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standardized benchmarks (protein–protein interactions and mutation stability) and on the prediction of functional sites from the Prosite database. We use COLLAPSE to search for similar sites across large protein datasets and to annotate proteins based on a database of known functional sites. These methods demonstrate that COLLAPSE is computationally efficient, tunable, and interpretable, providing a general-purpose platform for computational protein analysis.",
