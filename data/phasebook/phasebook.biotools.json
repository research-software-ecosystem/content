    "description": "Haplotyping programs package: LinkPHASE,HiddenPHASE, DualPHASE and DAGPHASE. The proposed methods work in two steps. First, haplotypes are reconstructed based on familial information (Mendelian segregation rules and linkage information) and next it fills in the gaps by applying a Hidden Markov Model (models from fastPHASE (Scheet and Stephens, 2006) or from Beagle (Browning and Browning, 2007)).",

We present a phasing program designed for large half-sibs families (as observed in plant and animals) that is robust to genotyping and map errors. We demonstrate that it is more efficient than previous versions and other programs, particularly in the presence of genotyping errors.",
