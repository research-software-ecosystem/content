Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.","authors":["Shannon P.","Markiel A.","Ozier O.","Baliga N.S.","Wang J.T.","Ramage D.","Amin N.","Schwikowski B.","Ideker T."],"cit_count":10310,"doi":"10.1101/gr.1239303","journal":"Genome Research","title":"Cytoscape: A software Environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks","year":"2003-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cytoscape","biotoolsID":"cytoscape","description":"Open source software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and integrating these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data.","homepage":"http://www.cytoscape.org/","name":"Cytoscape","version":["3.7.1"]}}
