Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.", "citationCount": 10310, "authors": [{"name": "Shannon P."}, {"name": "Markiel A."}, {"name": "Ozier O."}, {"name": "Baliga N.S."}, {"name": "Wang J.T."}, {"name": "Ramage D."}, {"name": "Amin N."}, {"name": "Schwikowski B."}, {"name": "Ideker T."}], "date": "2003-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cytoscape-helpdesk", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cytoscape", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["3.7.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cytoscape.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Network simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3562"}, {"term": "Pathway or network visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-06-16T19:07:24Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Open source software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and biological pathways and integrating these networks with annotations, gene expression profiles and other state data.", "toolType": ["Suite"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["lmatalonga"]}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "cytoscape", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:07:48Z", "name": "Cytoscape", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-tutorials/wiki", "note": "Tutorial material", "type": "Training material"}, {"url": "https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
