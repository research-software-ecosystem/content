    "description": "pbmm2 is a SMRT C++ wrapper for minimap2's C API. Its purpose is to support native PacBio in- and output, provide sets of recommended parameters, generate sorted output on-the-fly, and postprocess alignments. Sorted output can be used directly for polishing using GenomicConsensus, if BAM has been used as input to pbmm2. Benchmarks show that pbmm2 outperforms BLASR in sequence identity, number of mapped bases, and especially runtime. pbmm2 is the official replacement for BLASR.",
