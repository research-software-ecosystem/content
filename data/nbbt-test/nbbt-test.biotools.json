                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Rapid development of transcriptome sequencing technologies has resulted in a data revolution and emergence of new approaches to study transcriptomic regulation such as alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, CRISPR knockout screening in addition to the regular gene expression. A full characterization of the transcriptional landscape of different groups of cells or tissues holds enormous potential for both basic science as well as clinical applications. Although many methods have been developed in the realm of differential gene expression analysis, they all geared towards a particular type of sequencing data and failed to perform well when applied in different types of transcriptomic data. To fill this gap, we offer a negative beta binomial t-test (NBBt-test). NBBt-test provides multiple functions to perform differential analyses of alternative splicing, polyadenylation, CRISPR knockout screening, and gene expression datasets. Both real and large-scale simulation data show superior performance of NBBt-test with higher efficiency, and lower type I error rate and FDR to identify differential isoforms and differentially expressed genes and differential CRISPR knockout screening genes with different sample sizes when compared against the current very popular statistical methods. An R-package implementing NBBt-test is available for downloading from CRAN (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=NBBttest).",
