Frequently, one also runs post-processors such as Percolator to assess the confidence, infer unique peptides, and increase the number of identifications. A recent search engine, MS-GF+, has shown promising results, due to a new and efficient scoring algorithm. However, MS-GF+ provides few statistical estimates about the peptide-spectrum matches, hence limiting the biological interpretation. Here, we enabled Percolator processing for MS-GF+ output and observed an increased number of identified peptides for a wide variety of data sets. In addition, Percolator directly reports p values and false discovery rate estimates, such as q values and posterior error probabilities, for peptide-spectrum matches, peptides, and proteins, functions that are useful for the whole proteomics community. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","authors":["Granholm V.","Kim S.","Navarro J.C.F.","Sjolund E.","Smith R.D.","Kall L."],"cit_count":32,"doi":"10.1021/pr400937n","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","title":"Fast and accurate database searches with MS-GF+percolator","type":"Other","year":"2014-02-07"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:msgfplus","biotoolsID":"msgfplus","description":"This package contains function to perform peptide identification using MS-GF+.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSGFplus.html","name":"MSGFplus","version":["1.8.0"]}}
