                "abstract": "Phylogenetic footprinting is a technique that identifies regulatory elements by finding unusually well conserved regions in a set of orthologous noncoding DNA sequences from multiple species. We introduce a new motif-finding problem, the Substring Parsimony Problem, which is a formalization of the ideas behind phylogenetic footprinting, and we present an exact dynamic programming algorithm to solve it. We then present a number of algorithmic optimizations that allow our program to run quickly on most biologically interesting datasets. We show how to handle data sets in which only an unknown subset of the sequences contains the regulatory element. Finally, we describe how to empirically assess the statistical significance of the motifs found. Each technique is implemented and successfully identifies a number of known binding sites, as well as several highly conserved but uncharacterized regions. The program is available at http://bio.cs.washington.edu/software.html.",

We describe a computer algorithm designed specifically for this purpose, making use of the phylogenetic relationships among the sequences under study to make more accurate predictions. The program is guaranteed to report all sets of motifs with the lowest parsimony scores, calculated with respect to the phylogenetic tree relating the input species. We report the results of this algorithm on several data sets of interest. A large number of known functional binding sites are identified by our method, but we also find several highly conserved motifs for which no function is yet known.",
