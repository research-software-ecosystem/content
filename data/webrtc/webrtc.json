Principles of heterogeneous workflow management systems and state-of-The-Art technologies such as the microservices architectural pattern, peer-To-peer networking, and the single-page application concept are combined to build a scalable and extensible platform to aid collaboration among geographically distributed healthcare professionals. The real-Time communication capabilities are based on the webRTC protocol to enable direct communication among clients. This paper discusses the conceptual and technical details of the system, emphasizing on its innovative elements.",
