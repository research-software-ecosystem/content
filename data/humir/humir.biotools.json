Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.For many research aspects on small non-coding RNAs, especially microRNAs, computational tools and databases are developed. This includes quantification of miRNAs, piRNAs, tRNAs and tRNA fragments, circRNAs and others. Furthermore, the prediction of new miRNAs, isomiRs, arm switch events, target and target pathway prediction and miRNA pathway enrichment are common tasks. Additionally, databases and resources containing expression profiles, e.g., from different tissues, organs or cell types, are generated. This information in turn leads to improved miRNA repositories. While most of the respective tools are implemented in a species-independent manner, we focused on tools for human small non-coding RNAs. This includes four aspects: (1) miRNA analysis tools (2) databases on miRNAs and variations thereof (3) databases on expression profiles (4) miRNA helper tools facilitating frequent tasks such as naming conversion or reporter assay design. Although dependencies between the tools exist and several tools are jointly used in studies, the interoperability is limited. We present HumiR, a joint web presence for our tools. HumiR facilitates an entry in the world of miRNA research, supports the selection of the right tool for a research task and represents the very first step towards a fully integrated knowledge-base for human small non-coding RNA research. We demonstrate the utility of HumiR by performing a very comprehensive analysis of Alzheimer\u2019s miRNAs.",
