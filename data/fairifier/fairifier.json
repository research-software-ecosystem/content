This FAIRifier enables a post-hoc FAIRification workflow: load an existing dataset, perform data wrangling tasks, add FAIR attributes to the data, generate a linked data version of the data and, finally, push the result to an online FAIR data infrastructure to make it accessible and discoverable. Literal values in a dataset can be replaced by identifiers either manually or by embedded, customizable script expressions. The interoperability of the dataset can be improved by connecting these identifiers into a meaningful semantic graph-structure of ontological classes and properties using the integrated RDF model editor. A provenance trail automatically keeps track of each modification and additionally enables \u201cundo\u201d operations and repetition of operations on similar datasets. A FAIR data export function opens up a metadata editor to provide information about the dataset itself.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["rajireturn", "burger"]}, "language": ["JavaScript", "Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "FAIRifier", "additionDate": "2019-07-04T07:50:47Z", "name": "FAIRifier", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
