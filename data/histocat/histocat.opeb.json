All Rights Reserved. Single-cell, spatially resolved omics analysis of tissues is poised to transform biomedical research and clinical practice. We have developed an open-source, computational histology topography cytometry analysis toolbox (histoCAT) to enable interactive, quantitative, and comprehensive exploration of individual cell phenotypes, cell-cell interactions, microenvironments, and morphological structures within intact tissues. We highlight the unique abilities of histoCAT through analysis of highly multiplexed mass cytometry images of human breast cancer tissues.","authors":["Schapiro D.","Jackson H.W.","Raghuraman S.","Fischer J.R.","Zanotelli V.R.T.","Schulz D.","Giesen C.","Catena R.","Varga Z.","Bodenmiller B."],"cit_count":24,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4391","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"HistoCAT: Analysis of cell phenotypes and interactions in multiplex image cytometry data","year":"2017-08-31"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:histocat","biotoolsID":"histocat","description":"Histology Topography Cytometry Analysis Toolbox (histoCAT) is a package to visualize and analyse multiplexed image cytometry data interactively.","homepage":"http://www.bodenmillerlab.org/research-2/histoCAT/","name":"histoCAT"}}
