Different gene identification schemes and functional annotation methods used in these databases present a challenge for cross-referencing and the efficient use of the data. The Bioinformatics Resource for Oral Pathogens (BROP) aims to integrate bioinformatics data from multiple sources for easy comparison, analysis and data-mining through specially designed software interfaces. Currently, databases and tools provided by BROP include: (i) a graphical genome viewer (Genome Viewer) that allows side-by-side visual comparison of independently annotated datasets for the same genome; (ii) a pipeline of automatic data-mining algorithms to keep the genome annotation always up-to-date; (iii) comparative genomic tools such as Genome-wide ORF Alignment (GOAL); and (iv) the Oral Pathogen Microarray Database. BROP can also handle unfinished genomic sequences and provides secure yet flexible control over data access. The concept of providing an integrated source of genomic data, as well as the data-mining model used in BROP can be applied to other organisms. BROP can be publicly accessed at http://www.brop.org/. © 2005 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Chen T.","Abbey K.","Deng W.-J.","Cheng M.-C."],"cit_count":28,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15980574","title":"The bioinformatics resource for oral pathogens","year":"2005-07-01"},{"abstract":"We used Porphyromonas gingivalis gene microarrays to compare the total gene contents of the virulent strain W83 and the avirulent type strain, ATCC 33277. Signal ratios and scatter plots indicated that the chromosomes were very similar, with approximately 93% of the predicted genes in common, while at least 7% of them showed very low or no signals in ATCC 33277. Verification of the array results by PCR indicated that several of the disparate genes were either absent from or variant in ATCC 33277. Divergent features included already reported insertion sequences and ragB, as well as additional hypothetical and functionally assigned genes. Several of the latter were organized in a putative operon in W83 and encoded enzymes involved in capsular polysaccharide synthesis. Another cluster was associated with two paralogous regions of the chromosome with a low G+C content, at 41%, compared to that of the whole genome, at 48%. These regions also contained conserved and species-specific hypothetical genes, transposons, insertion sequences, and integrases and were located adjacent to tRNA genes; thus, they had several characteristics of pathogenicity islands. While this global comparative analysis showed the close relationship between W83 and ATCC 33277, the clustering of genes that are present in W83 but divergent in or absent from ATCC 33277 is suggestive of chromosomal islands that may have been acquired by lateral gene transfer.","authors":["Chen T.","Hosogi Y.","Nishikawa K.","Abbey K.","Fleischmann R.D.","Walling J.","Duncan M.J."],"cit_count":69,"journal":"Journal of Bacteriology","pmid":"15292149","title":"Comparative whole-genome analysis of virulent and avirulent strains of Porphyromonas gingivalis","year":"2004-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:brop","biotoolsID":"brop","description":"The Bioinformatics Resource for Oral Pathogens (BROP) contains tools for genomics of oral pathogens including Genome Viewer, GOAL (genome wide ORF alignment), an oral pathogen microarray database, an entrez counter, oral pathogen specific BLAST, and a codon usage database.","homepage":"http://brop.org/","name":"BROP"}}
