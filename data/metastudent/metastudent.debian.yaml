summary: predictor of Gene Ontology terms from protein sequence - data files
description: >
   Often, only the sequence of a protein is known, but
   not its functions. Metastudent will try to predict
   missing functional annotations through homology searches (BLAST).
   .
   All predicted functions correspond to Gene Ontology (GO)
   terms from the Molecular Function Ontology (MFO) and the Biological Process
   Ontology (BPO) and are associated with a reliability score.
   .
   This package contains data files for metastudent.
