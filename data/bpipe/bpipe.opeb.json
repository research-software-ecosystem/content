It specializes in enabling users to turn existing pipelines based on shell scripts or command line tools into highly flexible, adaptable and maintainable workflows with a minimum of effort. Bpipe ensures that pipelines execute in a controlled and repeatable fashion and keeps audit trails and logs to ensure that experimental results are reproducible. Requiring only Java as a dependency, Bpipe is fully self-contained and cross-platform, making it very easy to adopt and deploy into existing environments. © The Author 2012.
