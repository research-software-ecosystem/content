  "sc:description": "A network of protein-chemical structure interactions. Progress in structure determination methods means that the set of experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins in complex with small molecules is growing exponentially. ProtChemSI exploits and extends this useful set of structures by both collecting and annotating the existing data as well as providing models of potential complexes inferred by protein or chemical structure similarity.",
