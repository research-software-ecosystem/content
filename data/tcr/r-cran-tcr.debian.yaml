  description: Advanced Data Analysis of Immune Receptor Repertoires
  long_description: " Cells of the immune system are the grand exception to the rule\n\
    \ that all cells of an individuum have (mostly exact) copies of the\n same DNA.\
    \ B cells (which produce antibodies) and T cells (which\n communicate with cells)\
    \ however have a section of their DNA with\n genes of the groups V, D and J that\
    \ are reorganised within the\n genomic DNA to provide the flexibility to deal\
    \ with yet unknown\n pathogens.\n .\n This package provides a platform for the\
    \ advanced analysis of T\n cell receptor repertoire data and its visualisations.\n\
    \ .\n Caveat: This package is soon to be replaced by\n http://github.com/immunomind/immunarch\
    \ which is not yet available\n as a Debian package.\n"
