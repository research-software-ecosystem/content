One important problem is to summarize these partial phylogenetic trees using a supernetwork. We propose a novel simulated annealing based method called SNSA which uses an optimization function to produce a simple network that still retains a great deal of phylogenetic information. We report the performance of this new method on real and simulated datasets. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","authors":["Hassanzadeh R.","Eslahchi C.","Sung W.-K."],"cit_count":1,"journal":"Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution","pmid":"22426435","title":"Constructing phylogenetic supernetworks based on simulated annealing","year":"2012-06-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snsa","biotoolsID":"snsa","description":"A method to construct a supernetwork from partial trees based on simulated annealing.","homepage":"http://bs.ipm.ir/softwares/snsa/","name":"SNSA"}}
