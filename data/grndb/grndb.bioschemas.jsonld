GRNdb is a freely accessible and user-friendly database for conveniently exploring and visualizing the predicted regulatory networks formed by transcription factors (TFs) and downstream target genes (termed regulons) based on large-scale RNA-seq data as well as the known TF-target relationships for various human and mouse conditions.",
