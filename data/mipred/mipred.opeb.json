Besides, a novel machine-learning algorithm, random forest (RF), is introduced. The results suggest that our method predicts at 98.21% specificity and 95.09% sensitivity. When compared with the previous study, Triplet-SVM-classifier, our RF method was nearly 10% greater in total accuracy. Further analysis indicated that the improvement was due to both the combined features and the RF algorithm. The MiPred web server is available at http://www.bioinf.seu.edu.cn/miRNA/. Given a sequence, MiPred decides whether it is a pre-miRNA-like hairpin sequence or not. If the sequence is a pre-miRNA-like hairpin, the RF classifier will predict whether it is a real premiRNA or a pseudo one. © 2007 The Author(s).","authors":["Jiang P.","Wu H.","Wang W.","Ma W.","Sun X.","Lu Z."],"cit_count":332,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"17553836","title":"MiPred: Classification of real and pseudo microRNA precursors using random forest prediction model with combined features","year":"2007-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mipred","biotoolsID":"mipred","description":"This tool can distinguish between real and pseudo microRNA precursors.","homepage":"http://www.bioinf.seu.edu.cn/miRNA/","name":"miPred"}}
