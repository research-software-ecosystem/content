Besides, a novel machine-learning algorithm, random forest (RF), is introduced. The results suggest that our method predicts at 98.21% specificity and 95.09% sensitivity. When compared with the previous study, Triplet-SVM-classifier, our RF method was nearly 10% greater in total accuracy. Further analysis indicated that the improvement was due to both the combined features and the RF algorithm. The MiPred web server is available at http://www.bioinf.seu.edu.cn/miRNA/. Given a sequence, MiPred decides whether it is a pre-miRNA-like hairpin sequence or not. If the sequence is a pre-miRNA-like hairpin, the RF classifier will predict whether it is a real premiRNA or a pseudo one. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 332, "authors": [{"name": "Jiang P."}, {"name": "Wu H."}, {"name": "Wang W."}, {"name": "Ma W."}, {"name": "Sun X."}, {"name": "Lu Z."}], "date": "2007-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mipred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bioinf.seu.edu.cn/miRNA/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "microRNA detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0463"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:39Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool can distinguish between real and pseudo microRNA precursors.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "mipred", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T14:14:17Z", "name": "miPred", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
