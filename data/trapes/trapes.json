The T cell compartment must contain diversity in both T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and cell state to provide effective immunity against pathogens. However, it remains unclear how differences in the TCR contribute to heterogeneity in T cell state. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can allow simultaneous measurement of TCR sequence and global transcriptional profile fromsingle cells. However, current methods for TCR inference from scRNA-seq are limited in their sensitivity and require long sequencing reads, thus increasing the cost and decreasing the number of cells that can be feasibly analyzed. Here we present TRAPeS, a publicly available tool that can efficiently extract TCR sequence information from short-read scRNA-seq libraries. We apply it to investigate heterogeneity in the CD8+ T cell response in humans and mice, and show that it is accurate and more sensitive than existing approaches. Coupling TRAPeS with transcriptome analysis of CD8+ T cells specific for a single epitope from Yellow Fever Virus (YFV), we show that the recently described 'naivelike' memory population have significantly longer CDR3 regions and greater divergence from germline sequence than do effector-memory phenotype cells. This suggests that TCR usage is associated with the differentiation state of the CD8+ T cell response to YFV.", "citationCount": 20, "authors": [{"name": "Afik S."}, {"name": "Yates K.B."}, {"name": "Bi K."}, {"name": "Darko S."}, {"name": "Godec J."}, {"name": "Gerdemann U."}, {"name": "Swadling L."}, {"name": "Douek D.C."}, {"name": "Klenerman P."}, {"name": "Barnes E.J."}, {"name": "Sharpe A.H."}, {"name": "Haining W.N."}, {"name": "Yosef N."}], "date": "2017-09-19T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Shaked Afik", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "safik@berkeley.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:TRAPeS", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/YosefLab/TRAPeS", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence alignment (nucleic acid)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1383"}, "format": [{"term": "BAM", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2572"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence generation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0230"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence report", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2955"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-29T14:19:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Software for reconstruction of T cell receptors (TCR) using short, paired-end single-cell RNA-sequencing.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/YosefLab/TRAPeS/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}], "biotoolsID": "TRAPeS", "additionDate": "2019-06-22T10:45:16Z", "name": "TRAPeS", "license": "Other", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/YosefLab/TRAPeS/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
