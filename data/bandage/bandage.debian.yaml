description: 'Bandage is a GUI program that allows users to interact with the assembly
  graphs made by de novo assemblers such as Velvet, SPAdes, MEGAHIT and others. .
  De novo assembly graphs contain not only assembled contigs but also the connections
  between those contigs, which were previously not easily accessible. Bandage visualises
  assembly graphs, with connections, using graph layout algorithms. Nodes in the drawn
  graph, which represent contigs, can be automatically labelled with their ID, length
  or depth. Users can interact with the graph by moving, labelling and colouring nodes.
  Sequence information can also be extracted directly from the graph viewer. By displaying
  connections between contigs, Bandage opens up new possibilities for analysing and
  improving de novo assemblies that are not possible by looking at contigs alone.
  . More information and download links are on the Bandage website: rrwick.github.io/Bandage
  . The package is relevant to the field of genome assembly.'
