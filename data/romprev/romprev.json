ROMP estimates the trait heritability and the heritability attributable to a locus and requires genotyping the offspring only. In this study, the theory underlying ROMP was revised (ROMPrev) and extended. Computer simulations were used to determine the type I error and power of the test of association, and the accuracy of the locus-specific heritability estimate. The ROMPrev test had good power at the 5% significance level with properly controlled type I error. Locus-specific heritability estimates were, on average, close to simulated values. For non-zero locus-specific heritability, the proposed standard error was downwardly biased, yielding reduced coverage of 95% confidence intervals. A bootstrap approach with proper coverage is suggested as a second step for loci of interest. ROMPrev wasapplied to a study of cardiovascular-related traits to illustrate its use. An association between polymorphisms within the fibrinogen gene cluster and plasma fibrinogen was detected (p < 0.005) that accounted for 29% of the estimated fibrinogen heritability. The ROMPrev method provides a computationally fast and simple way of testing for association and obtaining accurate estimates of locus-specific heritability while minimizing the genotyping required. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 University College London.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Roy-Gagnon M.-H."}, {"name": "Mathias R.A."}, {"name": "Fallin M.D."}, {"name": "Jee S.H."}, {"name": "Broman K.W."}, {"name": "Wilson A.F."}], "date": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Annals of Human Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "afw@mail.nih.gov"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:romprev", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/ROMPrev/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Polymorphism detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3202"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-08T09:54:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A software suite for quantitative trait and locus-specific heritability estimation and association testing using the revised Regression of Offspring on Mid-Parent method.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/romprev-0-2-1-beta-revised-regression-offspring-mid-parent.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "romprev", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:58:12Z", "name": "ROMPrev 0.2.1 beta", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://research.nhgri.nih.gov/ROMPrev/features.shtml", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
