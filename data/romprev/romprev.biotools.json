                "abstract": "The Regression of Offspring on Mid-Parent (ROMP) method is a test of association between a quantitative trait and a candidate locus. ROMP estimates the trait heritability and the heritability attributable to a locus and requires genotyping the offspring only. In this study, the theory underlying ROMP was revised (ROMPrev) and extended. Computer simulations were used to determine the type I error and power of the test of association, and the accuracy of the locus-specific heritability estimate. The ROMPrev test had good power at the 5% significance level with properly controlled type I error. Locus-specific heritability estimates were, on average, close to simulated values. For non-zero locus-specific heritability, the proposed standard error was downwardly biased, yielding reduced coverage of 95% confidence intervals. A bootstrap approach with proper coverage is suggested as a second step for loci of interest. ROMPrev wasapplied to a study of cardiovascular-related traits to illustrate its use. An association between polymorphisms within the fibrinogen gene cluster and plasma fibrinogen was detected (p < 0.005) that accounted for 29% of the estimated fibrinogen heritability. The ROMPrev method provides a computationally fast and simple way of testing for association and obtaining accurate estimates of locus-specific heritability while minimizing the genotyping required. \u00a9 2007 The Authors Journal compilation \u00a9 2007 University College London.",
