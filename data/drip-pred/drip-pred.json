The process is feasible because the newest generation probe requires only small amounts of protein, typically 30-200 \u03bcg in 8-35 \u03bcl volume. Extensive automation has been made possible by the combination of database tools, mechanization of key process steps, and the use of a micro-cryoprobe that gives excellent data while requiring little optimization and manual setup. In this perspective, we describe the overall process used by the NESG for screening NMR samples as part of a sample optimization process, assessing optimal construct design and solution conditions, as well as for determining protein rotational correlation times in order to assess protein oligomerization states. Database infrastructure has been developed to allow for flexible implementation of new screening protocols and harvesting of the resulting output. The NESG micro NMR screening pipeline has also been used for detergent screening of membrane proteins. Descriptions of the individual steps in the NESG NMR sample design, production, and screening pipeline are presented in the format of a standard operating procedure.", "citationCount": 52, "authors": [{"name": "Rossi P."}, {"name": "Swapna G.V.T."}, {"name": "Huang Y.J."}, {"name": "Aramini J.M."}, {"name": "Anklin C."}, {"name": "Conover K."}, {"name": "Hamilton K."}, {"name": "Xiao R."}, {"name": "Acton T.B."}, {"name": "Ertekin A."}, {"name": "Everett J.K."}, {"name": "Montelione G.T."}], "date": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Biomolecular NMR"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "bils.se", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "maccallr@sbc.su.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:drip-pred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.sbc.su.se/%7Emaccallr/disorder/cgi-bin/submit.cgi", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Protein sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2976"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein features", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1277"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:36Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Disorder/order prediction for proteins.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "drip-pred", "additionDate": "2015-12-06T15:18:13Z", "name": "DRIP-PRED", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
