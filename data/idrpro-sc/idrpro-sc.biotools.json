                "abstract": "Nucleic acid-binding proteins are proteins that interact with DNA and RNA to regulate gene expression and transcriptional control. The pathogenesis of many human diseases is related to abnormal gene expression. Therefore, recognizing nucleic acid-binding proteins accurately and efficiently has important implications for disease research. To address this question, some scientists have proposed the method of using sequence information to identify nucleic acid-binding proteins. However, different types of nucleic acid-binding proteins have different subfunctions, and these methods ignore their internal differences, so the performance of the predictor can be further improved. In this study, we proposed a new method, called iDRPro-SC, to predict the type of nucleic acid-binding proteins based on the sequence information. iDRPro-SC considers the internal differences of nucleic acid-binding proteins and combines their subfunctions to build a complete dataset. Additionally, we used an ensemble learning to characterize and predict nucleic acid-binding proteins. The results of the test dataset showed that iDRPro-SC achieved the best prediction performance and was superior to the other existing nucleic acid-binding protein prediction methods. We have established a web server that can be accessed online: http://bliulab.net/iDRPro-SC.",
