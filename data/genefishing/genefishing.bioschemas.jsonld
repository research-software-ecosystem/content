      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | GeneFishing to reconstruct context specific portraits of biological processes | Rapid advances in genomic technologies have led to a wealth of diverse data, from which novel discoveries can be gleaned through the application of robust statistical and computational methods. Here, we describe GeneFishing, a semisupervised computational approach to reconstruct context-specific portraits of biological processes by leveraging gene-gene coexpression information. GeneFishing incorporates multiple high-dimensional statistical ideas, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, subsampling, and results aggregation, to produce robust results. To illustrate the power of our method, we applied it using 21 genes involved in cholesterol metabolism as \"bait\" to \"fish out\" (or identify) genes not previously identified as being connected to cholesterol metabolism",
