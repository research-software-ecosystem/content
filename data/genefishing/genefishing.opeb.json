Here, we describe GeneFishing, a semisupervised computational approach to reconstruct context-specific portraits of biological processes by leveraging gene-gene coexpression information. GeneFishing incorporates multiple high-dimensional statistical ideas, including dimensionality reduction, clustering, subsampling, and results aggregation, to produce robust results. To illustrate the power of our method, we applied it using 21 genes involved in cholesterol metabolism as \"bait\" to \"fish out\" (or identify) genes not previously identified as being connected to cholesterol metabolism","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31484776","name":"GeneFishing"}}
