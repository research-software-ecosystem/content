description: Many two-colour hybridizations suffer from a dye bias that is both gene-specific
  and slide-specific. The former depends on the content of the nucleotide used for
  labeling; the latter depends on the labeling percentage. The slide-dependency was
  hitherto not recognized, and made addressing the artefact impossible.  Given a reasonable
  number of dye-swapped pairs of hybridizations, or of same vs. same hybridizations,
  both the gene- and slide-biases can be estimated and corrected using the GASSCO
  method (Margaritis et al., Mol. Sys. Biol. 5:266 (2009), doi:10.1038/msb.2009.21)
