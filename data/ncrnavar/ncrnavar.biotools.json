Here we present ncRNAVar (http://www.liwzlab.cn/ncrnavar/), the first database that provides association data between validated ncRNA variants and human diseases through manual curation on 2650 publications and computational annotation. ncRNAVar contains 4565 associations between 711 human disease phenotypes and 3112 variants from 2597 ncRNAs. Each association was reviewed by professional curators, incorporated with valuable annotation and cross references, and designated with an association score by our refined score model. ncRNAVar offers web applications including association prioritization, network visualization, and relationship mapping. ncRNAVar, presenting a landscape of ncRNA variants in human diseases and a useful resource for subsequent software development, will improve our insight of relationships between ncRNA variants and human health.",
