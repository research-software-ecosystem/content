With the accumulation of high-throughput sequencing data in public databases, the size of available tumor samples is becoming larger and larger, which introduces new challenges to identify competing triplets. Here, we developed a novel method, called LncMiM, to detect the lncRNA\u2013miRNA\u2013mRNA competing triplets in ovarian cancer with tumor samples from the TCGA database. In LncMiM, non-linear correlation analysis is used to cover the problem of weak correlations between miRNA\u2013target pairs, which is mainly due to the difference in the magnitude of the expression level. In addition, besides the miRNA, the impact of lncRNA and mRNA on the interactions in triplets is also considered to improve the identification sensitivity of LncMiM without reducing its accuracy. By using LncMiM, a total of 847 lncRNA-associated competing triplets were found. All the competing triplets form a miRNA\u2013lncRNA pair centered regulatory network, in which ZFAS1, SNHG29, GAS5, AC112491.1, and AC099850.4 are the top five lncRNAs with most connections. The results of biological process and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicates that the competing triplets are mainly associated with cell division, cell proliferation, cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, and p53 signaling pathway. Through survival analysis, 107 potential prognostic biomarkers are found in the competing triplets, including FGD5-AS1, HCP5, HMGN4, TACC3, and so on.
