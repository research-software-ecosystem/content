The system annotates user submitted gene or protein sequences, identifying sequence families with no homologues of known structure, and characterizing each protein according to a range of physicochemical properties that may affect its expression, solubility and likelihood to crystallize. Summaries of these analyses are available for individual sequences, as well as whole datasets. This type of analysis enables structural biologists to iteratively select targets from their genomic sequences of interest and according to their research needs. All sequence datasets submitted to sgTarget are available for users to select and rank using their choice of criteria. sgTarget was developed to support individual laboratories collaborating in structural and functional genomics projects and should be valuable to structural biologists wishing to employ the wealth of available genome sequences in their structural quests. \u00a9 The Author 2006.
