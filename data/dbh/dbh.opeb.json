We propose an integrated pipeline methodology to measure the biomass of different tree cultivars in plantation forests with high crown density which that combines unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), hyperspectral image sensors, and data processing algorithms using machine learning. Using a planation of Cunninghamia lanceolate, commonly known as Chinese fir, in Fujian, China, images were collected using a hyperspectral camera and orthorectified in HiSpectral Stitcher","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.20944/PREPRINTS201907.0158.V1","name":"DBH"}}
