                "abstract": "MethylomeDB (http://epigenomics.columbia.edu/methylomedb/index.html) is a new database containing genome-wide brain DNA methylation profiles. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in the mammalian brain. In human studies, aberrant DNA methylation alterations have been associated with various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, and depression. In this database, we present methylation profiles of carefully selected non-psychiatric control, schizophrenia, and depression samples. We also include data on one mouse forebrain sample specimen to allow for cross-species comparisons. In addition to our DNA methylation data generated in-house, we have and will continue to include published DNA methylation data from other research groups with the focus on brain development and function. Users can view the methylation data at single-CpG resolution with the option of wiggle and microarray formats. They can also download methylation data for individual samples. MethylomeDB offers an important resource for research into brain function and behavior. It provides the first source of comprehensive brain methylome data, encompassing whole-genome DNA methylation profiles of human and mouse brain specimens that facilitate cross-species comparative epigenomic investigations, as well as investigations of schizophrenia and depression methylomes. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.
