Here this package provides an implementation of circular layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available software. The flexibility of the package is based on the usage of low-level graphics functions such that self-defined high-level graphics can be easily implemented by users for specific purposes. Together with the seamless connection between the powerful computational and visual environment in R, it gives users more convenience and freedom to design figures for better understanding complex patterns behind multiple dimensional data.",
