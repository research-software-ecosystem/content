      "sc:description": "a comprehensive software for Direct Coupling Analysis of RNA and Protein Sequences.\n\nDirect coupling analysis software for protein and RNA sequences.\n\npydca is Python implementation of direct coupling analysis (DCA) of residue coevolution for protein and RNA sequence families using the mean-field and pseudolikelihood maximization algorithms. Given multiple sequence alignment (MSA) files in FASTA format, pydca computes the coevolutionary scores of pairs of sites in the alignment. In addition, when an optional file containing a reference sequence is supplied, scores corresponding to pairs of sites of this reference sequence are computed by mapping the reference sequence to the MSA. The software provides command line utilities or it can be used as a library",
