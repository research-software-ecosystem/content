Studies have shown that antiparasitic peptides can inhibit the growth and development of parasites and even kill them. Because traditional biological methods to determine the activity of antiparasitic peptides are time-consuming and costly, a method for large-scale prediction of antiparasitic peptides is urgently needed. We propose a computational approach called i2APP that can efficiently identify APPs using a two-step machine learning (ML) framework. First, in order to solve the imbalance of positive and negative samples in the training set, a random under sampling method is used to generate a balanced training data set. Then, the physical and chemical features and terminus-based features are extracted, and the first classification is performed by Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain 264-dimensional higher level features. These features are selected by Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and the features with the big MIC values are retained. Finally, the SVM algorithm is used for the second classification in the optimized feature space. Thus the prediction model i2APP is fully constructed. On independent datasets, the accuracy and AUC of i2APP are 0.913 and 0.935, respectively, which are better than the state-of-arts methods. The key idea of the proposed method is that multi-level features are extracted from peptide sequences and the higher-level features can distinguish well the APPs and non-APPs.",
