                "abstract": "© 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.The ionization efficiency of emerging contaminants was modeled for the first time in gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) which is coupled to an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source (APCI). The recent chemical space has been expanded in environmental samples such as soil, indoor dust, and sediments thanks to recent use of high-resolution mass spectrometric techniques; however, many of these chemicals have remained unquantified. Chemical exposure in dust can pose potential risk to human health, and semiquantitative analysis is potentially of need to semiquantify these newly identified substances and assist with their risk assessment and environmental fate. In this study, a rigorously tested semiquantification workflow was proposed based on GC-APCI-HRMS ionization efficiency measurements of 78 emerging contaminants. The mechanism of ionization of compounds in the APCI source was discussed via a simple connectivity index and topological structure. The quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR)-based model was also built to predict the APCI ionization efficiencies of unknowns and later use it for their quantification analyses. The proposed semiquantification method could be transferred into the household indoor dust sample matrix, and it could include the effect of recovery and matrix in the predictions of actual concentrations of analytes. A suspect compound, which falls inside the application domain of the tool, can be semiquantified by an online web application, free of access at http://trams.chem.uoa.gr/semiquantification/.",
