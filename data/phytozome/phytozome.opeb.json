To interact with this increasing body of data, we have developed Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net), a comparative hub for plant genome and gene family data and analysis. Phytozome provides a view of the evolutionary history of every plant gene at the level of sequence, gene structure, gene family and genome organization, while at the same time providing access to the sequences and functional annotations of a growing number (currently 25) of complete plant genomes, including all the land plants and selected algae sequenced at the Joint Genome Institute, as well as selected species sequenced elsewhere. Through a comprehensive plant genome database and web portal, these data and analyses are available to the broader plant science research community, providing powerful comparative genomics tools that help to link model systems with other plants of economic and ecological importance.","authors":["Goodstein D.M.","Shu S.","Howson R.","Neupane R.","Hayes R.D.","Fazo J.","Mitros T.","Dirks W.","Hellsten U.","Putnam N.","Rokhsar D.S."],"cit_count":1424,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22110026","title":"Phytozome: A comparative platform for green plant genomics","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:phytozome","biotoolsID":"phytozome","description":"Comparative hub for plant genome and gene family data and analysis.","homepage":"http://www.phytozome.net/","name":"Phytozome"}}
