    "description": "snHiC is a snakemake based end-to-end pipeline to analyze Hi-C data. The input files required to run the pipeline are Paired-End fastq files. The pipeline performs data quality control, normalization and correction. It also includes the possibility to perform grouped analyses (e.g, merging of replicates) besides TAD, loops and stripes detection and differential contacts and compartment analyses.",

Despite being widely used, analysis of Hi-C data is technically challenging and involves several time-consuming steps that often require manual involvement making it error prone, potentially affecting data reproducibility. In order to facilitate and simplify these analyses we implemented snHiC, a snakemake-based pipeline that allows for the generation of contact matrices at multiple resolutions in one single run, aggregation of individual samples into user-specified groups, detection of domains, compartments, loops and stripes and performance of differential compartment and chromatin interaction analyses.",
