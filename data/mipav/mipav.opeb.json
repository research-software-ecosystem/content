The tools perform semi-automatic brain extraction, tissue classification, Talairach alignment, and atlas-based measurements within a user-friendly graphical environment. They are implemented as plug-ins for MIPAV, a freely available medical image processing software package from the National Institutes of Health. Because the plug-ins and MIPAV are implemented in Java, both can be utilized on nearly any operating system platform. In addition to the software plug-ins, we have also released a digital version of the Talairach atlas that can be used to perform regional volumetric analyses. Several studies are conducted applying the new tools to simulated and real neuroimaging data sets. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.
