This work is written by US Government employees and is in the public domain in the US.Motivation: Identification of structural variants (SVs) in sequence data results in a large number of false positive calls using existing software, which overburdens subsequent validation. Results: Simulations using RAPTR-SV and other, similar algorithms for SV detection revealed that RAPTR-SV had superior sensitivity and precision, as it recovered 66.4% of simulated tandem duplications with a precision of 99.2%. When compared with calls made by Delly and LUMPY on available datasets from the 1000 genomes project, RAPTR-SV showed superior sensitivity for tandem duplications, as it identified 2-fold more duplications than Delly, while making ∼85% fewer duplication predictions. Availability and implementation: RAPTR-SV is written in Java and uses new features in the collections framework in the latest release of the Java version 8 language specifications. A compiled version of the software, instructions for usage and test results files are available on the GitHub repository page: https://github.com/njdbickhart/RAPTR-SV.","authors":["Bickhart D.M.","Hutchison J.L.","Xu L.","Schnabel R.D.","Taylor J.F.","Reecy J.M.","Schroeder S.","Van Tassell C.P.","Sonstegard T.S.","Liu G.E."],"cit_count":8,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25686638","title":"RAPTR-SV: A hybrid method for the detection of structural variants","year":"2015-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:raptr-sv","biotoolsID":"raptr-sv","description":"Read Pair and Split Read methods are used to identify structural variants in paired-end WGS data.","homepage":"https://github.com/njdbickhart/RAPTR-SV","name":"RAPTR-SV"}}
