Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Nucleotide Similarity Scanner (NSimScan) is specialized for searching massive DNA databases for distant similarities. Its targeted applications include phylogenomics, comparative and functional studies of non-coding sequences, contamination detection, etc. NSimScan outperforms industry standard tools in combined sensitivity, accuracy and speed, operating at sensitivity similar to BLAST, accuracy of ssearch and speed of MegaBLAST. Availability and implementation: NSimScan is available at https://github.com/abadona/qsimscan as a part of QSimScan package. It is implemented in C ++, distributed under MIT license and supported on Linux, OS X and Windows (with cygwin).","authors":["Novichkov V.","Kaznadzey A.","Alexandrova N.","Kaznadzey D."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw126","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"NSimScan: DNA comparison tool with increased speed, sensitivity and accuracy","type":"Primary","year":"2016-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:NSimScan","biotoolsID":"NSimScan","description":"DNA comparison tool with increased speed, sensitivity and accuracy.","homepage":"https://github.com/abadona/qsimscan","name":"NSimScan"}}
