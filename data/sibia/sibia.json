    "description": "Coupling brain-tumor biophysical models and diffeomorphic image registration.\n\nWe present SIBIA (Scalable Integrated Biophysics-based Image Analysis), a framework for joint image registration and biophysical inversion and we apply it to analyze MR images of glioblastomas (primary brain tumors). We have two applications in mind. The first one is normal-to-abnormal image registration in the presence of tumor-induced topology differences. The second one is biophysical inversion based on single-time patient data. The underlying optimization problem is highly non-linear and non-convex and has not been solved before with a gradient-based approach. Given the segmentation of a normal brain MRI and the segmentation of a cancer patient MRI, we determine tumor growth parameters and a registration map so that if we \"grow a tumor\" (using our tumor model) in the normal brain and then register it to the patient image, then the registration mismatch is as small as possible.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
