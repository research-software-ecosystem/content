description: This GNU R package provides significance analysis of microarrays. A microarray
  is a multiplex lab-on-a-chip. It is a 2D array on a solid substrate (usually a glass
  slide or silicon thin-film cell) that assays large amounts of biological material
  using high-throughput screening miniaturized, multiplexed and parallel processing
  and detection methods. . This package helps analysing this kind of microarrays.
