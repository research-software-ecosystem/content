When the output of whole genome sequencing (WGS) of a sample is available the ST can be assigned directly processing the read-set. Current approaches employ reads mapping (SRST2) against the MLST loci, k-mer distribution (stringMLST), selective assembly (GRAbB) or whole genome assembly (BIGSdb) followed by BLASTn sequence query. Here we present STRAIN (ST Reduced Assembly IdentificatioN), an R package that implements a hybrid strategy between assembly and mapping of the reads to assign the ST to an isolate starting from its read-sets. RESULTS:Analysis of 540 publicly accessible Illumina read sets showed STRAIN to be more accurate at correct allele assignment and new alleles identification compared to SRTS2, stringMLST and GRAbB","homepage":"https://gitlab.com/DalsaMat/STRAIN","name":"STRAIN"}}
