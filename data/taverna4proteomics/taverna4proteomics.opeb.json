In this article we describe the integration of a number of existing programs and tools in Taverna Workbench, a scientific workflow manager currently being developed in the bioinformatics community. We demonstrate how a workflow manager provides a single, visually clear and intuitive interface to complex data analysis tasks in proteomics, from raw mass spectrometry data to protein identifications and beyond. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","authors":["De Bruin J.S.","Deelde A.M.","Palmblads M."],"cit_count":13,"journal":"Molecular and Cellular Proteomics","pmid":"22411703","title":"Scientific workflow management in proteomics","year":"2012-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:taverna4proteomics","biotoolsID":"taverna4proteomics","description":"Taverna workflows for proteomics.","homepage":"http://ms-utils.org/Taverna/","name":"Taverna4Proteomics"}}
