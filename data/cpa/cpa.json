The Comparative Pathway Analyzer, CPA, calculates and displays the differences in metabolic reaction content between two sets of organisms. Because results are highly dependent on the distribution of organisms into these two sets and the appropriate definition of these sets often is not easy, we provide hierarchical clustering methods for the identification of significant groupings. CPA also visualizes the reaction content of several organisms simultaneously allowing easy comparison. Reaction annotation data and maps for visualizing the results are taken from the KEGG database. Additionally, users can upload their own annotation data. This website is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.
