biotools_id: macat
description: This library contains functions to investigate links between differential
  gene expression and the chromosomal localization of the genes. MACAT is motivated
  by the common observation of phenomena involving large chromosomal regions in tumor
  cells. MACAT is the implementation of a statistical approach for identifying significantly
  differentially expressed chromosome regions. The functions have been tested on a
  publicly available data set about acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Yeoh et al.Cancer
  Cell 2002), which is provided in the library 'stjudem'.
