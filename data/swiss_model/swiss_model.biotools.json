To overcome these limitations, we have developed the SWISS-MODEL server for automated knowledge-based protein modelling. The SWISS-MODEL server uses the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank as a source of structural information and automatically generates protein models for sequences which share significant similarities with at least one protein of known 3D-structure. We now use the software framework of the server to generate large collections of protein models. To store these models, we have established the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a new database for protein models generated by theoretical approaches. This repository is directly integrated with SWISS-PROT and other databases through the ExPASy World-Wide Web server (URL is http:(/)/www.expasy.ch).",

The content of the Repository is updated on a regular basis incorporating new sequences, taking advantage of new template structures becoming available and reflecting improvements in the underlying modelling algorithms.

The SWISS-MODEL Repository can be queried via an interactive website at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/repository/. Annotation and cross-linking of the models with other databases, e.g. Swiss-Prot on the ExPASy server, allow for seamless navigation between protein sequence and structure information.

Building homology models requires specialized programs and up-to-date sequence and structural databases. Integrating all required tools, programs and databases into a single web-based workspace facilitates access to homology modelling from a computer with web connection without the need of downloading and installing large program packages and databases. Results: SWISS-MODEL workspace is a web-based integrated service dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It assists and guides the user in building protein homology models at different levels of complexity. A personal working environment is provided for each user where several modelling projects can be carried out in parallel. Protein sequence and structure databases necessary for modelling are accessible from the workspace and are updated in regular intervals. Tools for template selection, model building and structure quality evaluation can be invoked from within the workspace. Workflow and usage of the workspace are illustrated by modelling human Cyclin A1 and human Transmembrane Protease 3. \u00a9 The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

The Swiss-PdbViewer not only acts as a client for SWISS-MODEL, but also provides a-large selection of structure analysis and display tools. In addition, we provide the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a database containing more than 3500 automatically generated protein models.

It pioneered the field of automated modeling starting in 1993 and is the most widely-used free web-based automated modeling facility today. In 2002 the server computed 120 000 user requests for 3D protein models. SWISS-MODEL provides several levels of user interaction through its World Wide Web interface: in the 'first approach mode' only an amino acid sequence of a protein is submitted to build a 3D model. Template selection, alignment and model building are done completely automated by the server. In the 'alignment mode', the modeling process is based on a user-defined target-template alignment. Complex modeling tasks can be handled with the 'project mode' using DeepView (Swiss-PdbViewer), an integrated sequence-to-structure workbench. All models are sent back via email with a detailed modeling report. WhatCheck analyses and ANOLEA evaluations are provided optionally. The reliability of SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated in the EVA-CM project. The SWISS-MODEL server is under constant development to improve the successful implementation of expert knowledge into an easy-to-use server.",
