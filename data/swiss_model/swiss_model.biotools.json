It pioneered the field of automated modeling starting in 1993 and is the most widely-used free web-based automated modeling facility today. In 2002 the server computed 120 000 user requests for 3D protein models. SWISS-MODEL provides several levels of user interaction through its World Wide Web interface: in the 'first approach mode' only an amino acid sequence of a protein is submitted to build a 3D model. Template selection, alignment and model building are done completely automated by the server. In the 'alignment mode', the modeling process is based on a user-defined target-template alignment. Complex modeling tasks can be handled with the 'project mode' using DeepView (Swiss-PdbViewer), an integrated sequence-to-structure workbench. All models are sent back via email with a detailed modeling report. WhatCheck analyses and ANOLEA evaluations are provided optionally. The reliability of SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated in the EVA-CM project. The SWISS-MODEL server is under constant development to improve the successful implementation of expert knowledge into an easy-to-use server.",

Fully automated servers such as SWISS-MODEL with user-friendly web interfaces generate reliable models without the need for complex software packages or downloading large databases. Here, we describe the latest version of the SWISS-MODEL expert system for protein structure modelling. The SWISS-MODEL template library provides annotation of quaternary structure and essential ligands and co-factors to allow for building of complete structural models, including their oligomeric structure. The improved SWISS-MODEL pipeline makes extensive use of model quality estimation for selection of the most suitable templates and provides estimates of the expected accuracy of the resulting models. The accuracy of the models generated by SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated by the CAMEO system. The new web site allows users to interactively search for templates, cluster them by sequence similarity, structurally compare alternative templates and select the ones to be used for model building. In cases where multiple alternative template structures are available for a protein of interest, a user-guided template selection step allows building models in different functional states.

We also introduce a new update concept which includes regular updates of an expanded set of core organism models and UniProtKB-based targets, complemented by user-driven on-demand update of individual models. With the new release of the modeling pipeline, SMR has implemented a REST-API and adopted an open licencing model for accessing model coordinates, thus enabling bulk download for groups of targets fostering re-use of models in other contexts.

                "abstract": "Homology modelling has matured into an important technique in structural biology, significantly contributing to narrowing the gap between known protein sequences and experimentally determined structures. Fully automated workflows and servers simplify and streamline the homology modelling process, also allowing users without a specific computational expertise to generate reliable protein models and have easy access to modelling results, their visualization and interpretation. Here, we present an update to the SWISS-MODEL server, which pioneered the field of automated modelling 25 years ago and been continuously further developed. Recently, its functionality has been extended to the modelling of homo- and heteromeric complexes. Starting from the amino acid sequences of the interacting proteins, both the stoichiometry and the overall structure of the complex are inferred by homology modelling. Other major improvements include the implementation of a new modelling engine, ProMod3 and the introduction a new local model quality estimation method, QMEANDisCo.

The availability of this method, and the resulting models, has however been restricted by the availability of expensive computer hardware and software. To overcome these limitations, we have developed an environment for comparative protein modeling that consists of SWISS-MODEL, a server for automated comparative protein modeling and of the SWISS-PdbViewer, a sequence to structure workbench. The Swiss-PdbViewer not only acts as a client for SWISS-MODEL, but also provides a-large selection of structure analysis and display tools. In addition, we provide the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a database containing more than 3500 automatically generated protein models. By making such tools freely available to the scientific community, we hope to increase the use of protein structures and models in the process of experiment design.",

In combination with the visualization tool Swiss-PdbViewer, the Internet-based Workspace and the SWISS-MODEL Repository, it provides a fully integrated sequence to structure analysis and modeling platform. This computational environment is made freely available to the scientific community with the aim to hide the computational complexity of structural bioinformatics and encourage bench scientists to make use of the ever-increasing structural information available. Indeed, over the last decade, the availability of structural information has significantly increased for many organisms as a direct consequence of the complementary nature of comparative protein modeling and experimental structure determination. This has a very positive and enabling impact on many different applications in biomedical research as described in this paper. © 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Homology models of proteins are of great interest for planning and analysing biological experiments when no experimental three-dimensional structures are available. Building homology models requires specialized programs and up-to-date sequence and structural databases. Integrating all required tools, programs and databases into a single web-based workspace facilitates access to homology modelling from a computer with web connection without the need of downloading and installing large program packages and databases. Results: SWISS-MODEL workspace is a web-based integrated service dedicated to protein structure homology modelling. It assists and guides the user in building protein homology models at different levels of complexity. A personal working environment is provided for each user where several modelling projects can be carried out in parallel. Protein sequence and structure databases necessary for modelling are accessible from the workspace and are updated in regular intervals. Tools for template selection, model building and structure quality evaluation can be invoked from within the workspace. Workflow and usage of the workspace are illustrated by modelling human Cyclin A1 and human Transmembrane Protease 3. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",

To overcome these limitations, we have developed the SWISS-MODEL server for automated knowledge-based protein modelling. The SWISS-MODEL server uses the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank as a source of structural information and automatically generates protein models for sequences which share significant similarities with at least one protein of known 3D-structure. We now use the software framework of the server to generate large collections of protein models. To store these models, we have established the SWISS-MODEL Repository, a new database for protein models generated by theoretical approaches. This repository is directly integrated with SWISS-PROT and other databases through the ExPASy World-Wide Web server (URL is http:(/)/www.expasy.ch).",
