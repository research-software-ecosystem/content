description: PrIME (Probabilistic Integrated Models of Evolution) is a package supporting
  inference of evolutionary parameters in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain
  Monte Carlo simulation. A distinguishing feature of PrIME is that the species tree
  is taken into account when analyzing gene trees. . The input data to PrIME is a
  multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format and the output data contains trees in
  Newick format.
