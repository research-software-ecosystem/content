summary: bayesian estimation of gene trees taking the species tree into account
description: >
   PrIME (Probabilistic Integrated Models of Evolution) is a package
   supporting inference of evolutionary parameters in a Bayesian framework
   using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. A distinguishing feature of
   PrIME is that the species tree is taken into account when analyzing gene
   trees.
   .
   The input data to PrIME is a multiple sequence alignment in FASTA format
   and the output data contains trees in Newick format.
version: 1.0.11
