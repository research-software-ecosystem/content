To date, a variety of methods have been explored and algorithms for candidate gene prioritization are gain ing in their usefulness. Here, we pro pose an algorithm for detecting gene- disease associations based on the human protein-protein interaction net work, known gene-disease associations, protein sequence, and protein func tional information at the molecular level. Our method, PhenoPred, is super vised: first, we mapped each gene/pro tein onto the spaces of disease and functional terms based on distance to all annotated proteins in the protein interaction network. We also encoded sequence, function, physicochemical, and predicted structural properties, such as secondary structure and flexi bility. We then trained support vector machines to detect gene-disease associ ations for a number of terms in Disease Ontology and provided evidence that, despite the noise/incompleteness of ex perimental data and unfinished ontol ogy of diseases, identification of candi date genes can be successful even when a large number of candidate disease terms are predicted on simultaneously. \u00a9 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 119, "authors": [{"name": "Radivojac P."}, {"name": "Peng K."}, {"name": "Clark W.T."}, {"name": "Peters B.J."}, {"name": "Mohan A."}, {"name": "Boyle S.M."}, {"name": "Mooney S.D."}], "date": "2008-08-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "predrag@indiana.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:phenopred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.phenopred.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Web-based tool designed to detect novel gene-disease associations in humans.
