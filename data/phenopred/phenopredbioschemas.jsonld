It is based on known gene-disease associations, protein-protein interaction data, protein functional annotation at a molecular level and protein sequence data. Machine learning principles are used to integrate heterogeneous data sources. It can be used to prioritize genes based on their likelihood to be associated with a given disease or to prioritize diseases for a given query gene.",
