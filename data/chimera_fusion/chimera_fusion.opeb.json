Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Chimera is a Bioconductor package that organizes, annotates, analyses and validates fusions reported by different fusion detection tools; current implementation can deal with output from bellerophontes, chimeraScan, deFuse, fusionCatcher, FusionFinder, FusionHunter, FusionMap, mapSplice, Rsubread, tophat-fusion and STAR. The core of Chimera is a fusion data structure that can store fusion events detected with any of the aforementioned tools. Fusions are then easily manipulated with standard R functions or through the set of functionalities specifically developed in Chimera with the aim of supporting the user in managing fusions and discriminating falsepositive results.","authors":["Beccuti M.","Carrara M.","Cordero F.","Lazzarato F.","Donatelli S.","Nadalin F.","Policriti A.","Calogero R.A."],"cit_count":9,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu662","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Chimera: A Bioconductor package for secondary analysis of fusion products","type":"Primary","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:chimera_fusion","biotoolsID":"chimera_fusion","description":"This package facilitates the characterisation of fusion products events.
