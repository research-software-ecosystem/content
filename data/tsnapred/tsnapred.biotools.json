Accurately identifying the interaction between protein and nucleic acid can strengthen the understanding of protein function. However, conventional methods are too time-consuming, and computational methods are type-agnostic predictions. We proposed an ensemble predictor termed TSNAPred and first used it to identify residues that bind to A-DNA, B-DNA, ssDNA, mRNA, tRNA and rRNA. TSNAPred combines LightGBM and capsule network, both learned on the feature derived from protein sequence. TSNAPred utilizes the sliding window technique to extract long-distance dependencies between residues and a weighted ensemble strategy to enhance the prediction performance. The results show that TSNAPred can effectively identify type-specific nucleic acid binding residues in our test set. What is more, it also can discriminate DNA-binding and RNA-binding residues, which has improved 5% to 10% on the AUC value compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The dataset and code of TSNAPred are available at: https://github.com/niewenjuan-csu/TSNAPred.",
