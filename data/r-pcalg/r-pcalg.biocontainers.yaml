description: Functions for causal structure learning and causal inference using graphical
  models. The main algorithms for causal structure learning are PC (for observational
  data without hidden variables), FCI and RFCI (for observational data with hidden
  variables), and GIES (for a mix of data from observational studies (i.e. observational
  data) and data from experiments involving interventions (i.e. interventional data)
  without hidden variables). For causal inference the IDA algorithm, the Generalized
  Backdoor Criterion (GBC), the Generalized Adjustment Criterion (GAC) and some related
  functions are implemented. Functions for incorporating background knowledge are
  provided.
