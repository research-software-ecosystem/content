In particular, the network descriptors developed in other disciplines have found increasing applications in the study of the protein, gene regulatory, metabolic, disease, and drug-targeted networks. Facilities are provided by the public web servers for computing network descriptors, but many descriptors are not covered, including those used or useful for biological studies. We upgraded the PROFEAT web server http://bidd2.nus.edu.sg/cgi-bin/profeat2016/main.cgi for computing up to 329 network descriptors and protein–protein interaction descriptors. PROFEAT network descriptors comprehensively describe the topological and connectivity characteristics of unweighted (uniform binding constants and molecular levels), edge-weighted (varying binding constants), node-weighted (varying molecular levels), edge-node-weighted (varying binding constants and molecular levels), and directed (oriented processes) networks. The usefulness of the network descriptors is illustrated by the literature-reported studies of the biological networks derived from the genome, interactome, transcriptome, metabolome, and diseasome profiles.","authors":["Zhang P.","Tao L.","Zeng X.","Qin C.","Chen S.Y.","Zhu F.","Yang S.Y.","Li Z.R.","Chen W.P.","Chen Y.Z."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2016.10.013","journal":"Journal of Molecular Biology","pmid":"27742592","title":"PROFEAT Update: A Protein Features Web Server with Added Facility to Compute Network Descriptors for Studying Omics-Derived Networks","type":"Primary","year":"2017-02-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:profeat","biotoolsID":"profeat","description":"Tool for computing commonly-used structural and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequence.
