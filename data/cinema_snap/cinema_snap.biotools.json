                "abstract": "© 2021 Author(s).We developed tools and a workflow for real-time analysis of data from dynamic diamond anvil cell experiments performed at user light sources. These tools allow users to determine the phases of matter observed during the compression of materials in order to make decisions during an experiment to improve the quality of experimental results and maximize the use of scarce experimental facility time. The tools fill a gap in dynamic compression data analysis tools that are real-time, are flexible to the needs of high-pressure scientists, connect to automated processing of results, can be easily incorporated into workflows with existing tools and data formats, and support remote experimental data analysis workflows. Specific analytics developed include novel automated two-peak analysis for overlapping peaks and multiple phases, coordinated views of pressure and temperature values, full-compression contour plots, and configurable views of integrated x-ray diffraction. We present an experimental use case to show how the tools produce real-time analytics that help the scientists revise parameters for the next compression.",
