Our new methods MUFold-SS, MUFold-Angle, MUFold-BetaTurn, and MUFold-GammaTurn, developed based on advanced deep neural networks, achieved state-of-the-art performance for predicting secondary structures, backbone torsion angles, beta-turns, and gamma-turns, respectively. An easy-to-use web service will provide the community a convenient way to use these methods for research and development. RESULTS:MUFold-SSW, a new web server, is presented","homepage":"http://mufold.org/mufold-ss-angle","name":"MUFold-SS"}}
