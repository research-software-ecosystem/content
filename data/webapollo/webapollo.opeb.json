One of the natural consequences following from current advances in sequencing technology is that there are more and more researchers sequencing new genomes. These researchers require tools to describe the functional features of their newly sequenced genomes. With Web Apollo researchers can use any of the common browsers (for example, Chrome or Firefox) to jointly analyze and precisely describe the features of a genome in real time, whether they are in the same room or working from opposite sides of the world. © 2013 Lee et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Lee E.","Helt G.A.","Reese J.T.","Munoz-Torres M.C.","Childers C.P.","Buels R.M.","Stein L.","Holmes I.H.","Elsik C.G.","Lewis S.E."],"cit_count":90,"doi":"10.1186/gb-2013-14-8-r93","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"Web Apollo: A web-based genomic annotation editing platform","type":"Primary","year":"2013-08-30"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:webapollo","biotoolsID":"webapollo","description":"Browser-based tool for distributed community annotation of sequences.","homepage":"http://gmod.org/wiki/WebApollo","name":"WebApollo"}}
