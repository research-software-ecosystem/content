    "description": "The Multi-Domain Genome Recovery v1.0 (MuDoGeR v1.0) framework is a tool developed to help users to recover Metagenome-Assembled Genomes and Uncultivated Viral Genomes from whole-genome sequence (WGS) samples simultaneously. The MuDoGeR v1.0 framework acts as a wrapper for several tools. It was designed to be an easy-to-use tool that outputs ready-to-use comprehensive files.",

                "abstract": "Several computational frameworks and workflows that recover genomes from prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses from metagenomes exist. Yet, it is difficult for scientists with little bioinformatics experience to evaluate quality, annotate genes, dereplicate, assign taxonomy and calculate relative abundance and coverage of genomes belonging to different domains. MuDoGeR is a user-friendly tool tailored for those familiar with Unix command-line environment that makes it easy to recover genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses from metagenomes, either alone or in combination. We tested MuDoGeR using 24 individual-isolated genomes and 574 metagenomes, demonstrating the applicability for a few samples and high throughput. While MuDoGeR can recover eukaryotic viral sequences, its characterization is predominantly skewed towards bacterial and archaeal viruses, reflecting the field's current state. However, acting as a dynamic wrapper, the MuDoGeR is designed to constantly incorporate updates and integrate new tools, ensuring its ongoing relevance in the rapidly evolving field. MuDoGeR is open-source software available at https://github.com/mdsufz/MuDoGeR. Additionally, MuDoGeR is also available as a Singularity container.",
