                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Environmental exposures during early life play a critical role in life-course health, yet the molecular phenotypes underlying environmental effects on health are poorly understood. In the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project, a multi-centre cohort of 1301 mother-child pairs, we associate individual exposomes consisting of >100 chemical, outdoor, social and lifestyle exposures assessed in pregnancy and childhood, with multi-omics profiles (methylome, transcriptome, proteins and metabolites) in childhood. We identify 1170 associations, 249 in pregnancy and 921 in childhood, which reveal potential biological responses and sources of exposure. Pregnancy exposures, including maternal smoking, cadmium and molybdenum, are predominantly associated with child DNA methylation changes. In contrast, childhood exposures are associated with features across all omics layers, most frequently the serum metabolome, revealing signatures for diet, toxic chemical compounds, essential trace elements, and weather conditions, among others. Our comprehensive and unique resource of all associations (https://helixomics.isglobal.org/) will serve to guide future investigation into the biological imprints of the early life exposome.",

All rights reserved.Summary: Genomics has dramatically improved our understanding of the molecular origins of certain human diseases. Nonetheless, our health is also influenced by the cumulative impact of exposures experienced across the life course (termed 'exposome'). The study of the high-dimensional exposome offers a new paradigm for investigating environmental contributions to disease etiology. However, there is a lack of bioinformatics tools for managing, visualizing and analyzing the exposome. The analysis data should include both association with health outcomes and integration with omic layers. We provide a generic framework called rexposome project, developed in the R/Bioconductor architecture that includes object-oriented classes and methods to leverage high-dimensional exposome data in disease association studies including its integration with a variety of high-throughput data types. The usefulness of the package is illustrated by analyzing a real dataset including exposome data, three health outcomes related to respiratory diseases and its integration with the transcriptome and methylome.",
