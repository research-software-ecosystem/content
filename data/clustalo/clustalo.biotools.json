The unit describes a basic protocol for taking a set of unaligned sequences and producing a full alignment. There are also protocols for using an external HMM or iteration to help improve an alignment.",

Here, we describe some recent additions to the package and benchmark some alternative ways of making alignments.

In general, Clustal Omega is fast enough to make very large alignments and the accuracy of protein alignments is high when compared to alternative packages. The package is freely available as executables or source code from www.clustal.org or can be run on-line from a variety of sites, especially the EBI www.ebi.ac.uk.",

                "abstract": "Multiple sequence alignments are fundamental to many sequence analysis methods. Most alignments are computed using the progressive alignment heuristic. These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam. © 2011 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",
