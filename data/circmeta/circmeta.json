    "description": "a unified computational framework for genomic feature annotation and differential expression analysis of circular RNAs | circMeta is a unified computational framework for circRNA analyses. circMeta mainly includes three function modules: (i) provide a comprehensive genomic feature annotation related to circRNA biogenesis, including length of introns flanking circularized exons, repetitive elements such as Alu and SINEs, competition score for forming circulation and RNA editing in back-spliced flanking introns (ii) develop a two-stage DE approach of circRNAs based on splicing junction reads (iii) develop a Bayesian hierarchical model for DE analysis of circRNAs based the ratio of circular reads to linear reads in spliced sites. circMeta mainly consists of four modules: circClass, circFeature, circJuncDE, circCLRDE | A unified computational framework for genomic feature annotation, differential expression analysis of circular RNAs",
