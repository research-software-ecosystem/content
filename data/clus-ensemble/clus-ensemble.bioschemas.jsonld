      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'HMC', 'HMC-GA', 'Machine learning discovering missing wrong protein function annotations', 'FunCat' | Machine learning for discovering missing or wrong protein function annotations | Clus is a decision tree and rule induction system that implements the predictive clustering framework. This framework unifies unsupervised clustering and predictive modelling and allows for a natural extension to more complex prediction settings such as multi-task learning and multi-label classification | Clus is co-developed by the Declarative Languages and Artificial Intelligence group of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium, and the Department of Knowledge Technologies of the Jožef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia | Clus is free software (licensed under the GPL) and can be obtained from this website",
