Aims: This was written to provide a Blueprint to organisations creating electronic medication management solutions. Methods: We created a full set of electronic prescribing Functional Requirement User Stories (FRUS's) to guide the design of a digital prescribing solution. The scoping exercise was completed delivering over 900 individual FRUS's in a structured manner. The design of the FRUS's began at the most general level and at each level each story was broken into its subsequent branching parts, in tree diagram style, to become progressively more detailed. All FRUS's needed, at a minimum, four levels of detail to be fully described to a degree adequate enough to build software for, with some needing up to seven levels to be fully described. Results: The full content of the branching diagram of Functional Requirement User Stories (FRUS's) can be found at http://bit.ly/ElectronicMedsMan-FRUS. This approach to designing the requirements reduced the operational time for design by 75% and improving the completeness of the dataset by 47%. The full output link is provided to facilitate a further reduction in that time. Conclusion: Using a branching, structured approach to designing the requirements of an electronic prescribing system was more accurate and more efficient. This approach can be used for other digital health solutions as well as prescribing. We have shared the output database free of charge.","authors":["Mekhail A.-M.","Peasley M.","Lewis B.","Taylor J.","Charters C."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1016/J.COMPBIOMED.2019.103388","journal":"Computers in Biology and Medicine","pmid":"31437627","title":"Designing digital prescribing: A new approach with branch diagrams","year":"2019-10-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:FRUS","biotoolsID":"FRUS","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Designing digital prescribing' | A new approach with branch diagrams | EMM Functional Requirements Publicly Available | Visse funktioner i Excel kan ikke vises i Google Sheets og vil forsvinde, hvis du foretager ændringer | Allow administration recording during change from BST to GMT (1 hour gained, two x 0100 to 0200)","homepage":"http://bit.ly/ElectronicMedsMan-FRUS","name":"FRUS"}}
