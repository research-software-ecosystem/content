description: The term 'GeneSelector' refers to a filter selecting those genes which
  are consistently identified as differentially expressed using various statistical
  procedures. 'Selected' genes are those present at the top of the list in various
  ranking methods (currently 14). In addition, the stability of the findings can be
  taken into account in the final ranking by examining perturbed versions of the original
  data set, e.g. by leaving samples, swapping class labels, generating bootstrap replicates
  or adding noise. Given multiple ranked lists, one can use aggregation methods in
  order to find a synthesis.
