Researchers working on more specific problems, for instance on an individual pathway or complex, also need to be able to quickly, completely and accurately annotate sequences. The Bioverse sequence annotation server (http://bioverse.compbio.washington.edu) provides a web-based interface to allow users to submit protein sequences to the Bioverse framework. Sequences are functionally and structurally annotated and potential contextual annotations are provided. Researchers can also submit candidate genomes for annotation of all proteins encoded by the genome (proteome).",

However, the amount of effort and resources required for the elucidation of experimental protein interaction networks is prohibitive. Previously we, and others, have developed techniques to predict protein interactions for novel genomes using computational methods and data generated from other genomes. Results: We evaluated the performance of a network-based functional annotation method that makes use of our predicted protein interaction networks. We show that this approach performs equally well on experimentally derived and predicted interaction networks, for both manually and computationally assigned annotations. We applied the method to predicted protein interaction networks for over 50 organisms from all domains of life, providing annotations for many previously unannotated proteins and verifying existing low-confidence annotations. \u00a9 The Author 2005.

A recent publication by Date and Marcotte describes the use of phylogenetic profiling for elucidating novel pathways in proteomes that have not been experimentally characterized. This method, in combination with other computational methods for generating protein-interaction networks, might help identify novel functional pathways and enhance functional annotation of individual proteins.",
