    "description": "IBRENA (Insilico Biochemical REaction Network Analysis) is a software to aid the analysis of complex biological reaction networks. In order to reduce computation time, in some cases, ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are solved using Visual FORTRAN (HP-Compaq V6.6, Palo Alto, CA) with integrated IMSL library (Visual Numerics Inc., Houston, TX). This reduces the computational time required for time-consuming sensitivity analysis.",

The software features a graphical user interface that aids simulation and plotting of in silico results. While the primary focus is to aid formulation, testing and reduction of theoretical biochemical reaction networks, the program can also be used for analysis of high-throughput genomic and proteomic data. \u00a9 The Author 2008.
