The software features a graphical user interface that aids simulation and plotting of in silico results. While the primary focus is to aid formulation, testing and reduction of theoretical biochemical reaction networks, the program can also be used for analysis of high-throughput genomic and proteomic data. \u00a9 The Author 2008.
