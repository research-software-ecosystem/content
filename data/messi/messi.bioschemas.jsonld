      "sc:description": "Identifying signaling genes in spatial single cell expression data.\n\nMESSI (Mixture of Experts for Spatial Signaling genes Identification) is a predictive framework to identify signaling genes active in cell-cell interaction. It jointly models gene interactions within and between cells, using the recently developed spatial single cell expression data. MESSI combines the ability to subdivide cell types with multi-task learning to accurately infer the expression of a set of response genes based on signaling genes and to provide useful biological insights about key signaling genes and cell subtypes.",
