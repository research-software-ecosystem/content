Current algorithms used on hematoxylin and eosin slides are based on individual cell nuclei morphology with limited local context features. Here, we propose a novel multi-resolution hierarchical framework (SuperCRF) inspired by the way pathologists perceive regional tissue architecture to improve cell classification and demonstrate its clinical applications. We develop SuperCRF by training a state-of-art deep learning spatially constrained- convolution neural network (SC-CNN) to detect and classify cells from 105 high-resolution (20\u00d7) H&E-stained slides of The Cancer Genome Atlas melanoma dataset and subsequently, a conditional random field (CRF) by combining cellular neighborhood with tumor regional classification from lower resolution images (5, 1.25\u00d7) given by a superpixel-based machine learning framework. SuperCRF led to an 11.85% overall improvement in the accuracy of the state-of-art deep learning SC-CNN cell classifier. Consistent with a stroma-mediated immune suppressive microenvironment, SuperCRF demonstrated that (i) a high ratio of lymphocytes to all lymphocytes within the stromal compartment (p = 0.026) and (ii) a high ratio of stromal cells to all cells (p < 0.0001 compared to p = 0.039 for SC-CNN only) are associated with poor survival in patients with melanoma. SuperCRF improves cell classification by introducing global and local context-based information and can be implemented in combination with any single-cell classifier. SuperCRF provides valuable tools to study the tumor microenvironment and identify predictors of survival and response to therapy.",
