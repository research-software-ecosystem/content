                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s).MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and biological processes through binding to messenger RNAs. Predicting the relationship between miRNAs and their targets is crucial for research and clinical applications. Many tools have been developed to predict miRNA–target interactions, but variable results among the different prediction tools have caused confusion for users. To solve this problem, we developed miRgo, an application that integrates many of these tools. To train the prediction model, extreme values and median values from four different data combinations, which were obtained via an energy distribution function, were used to find the most representative dataset. Support vector machines were used to integrate 11 prediction tools, and numerous feature types used in these tools were classified into six categories—binding energy, scoring function, evolution evidence, binding type, sequence property, and structure—to simplify feature selection. In addition, a novel evaluation indicator, the Chu-Hsieh-Liang (CHL) index, was developed to improve the prediction power in positive data for feature selection. miRgo achieved better results than all other prediction tools in evaluation by an independent testing set and by its subset of functionally important genes. The tool is available at http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/miRgo.",
