DIALIGN-TX combines the greedy heuristic previously used in DIALIGN with a more traditional 'progressive' approach for improved performance on locally and globally related sequence sets. In addition, we offer a version of DIALIGN that uses predicted protein secondary structures together with primary sequence information to construct multiple protein alignments. Both programs are available through 'Göttingen Bioinformatics Compute Server' (GOBICS). © The Author(s) 2010.
