The program maps and aligns a single sequence with minimal startup time and memory requirements, and provides fast batch processing of large sequence sets. The program generates accurate gene structures, even in the presence of substantial polymorphisms and sequence errors, without using probabilistic splice site models. Methodology underlying the program includes a minimal sampling strategy for genomic mapping, oligomer chaining for approximate alignment, sandwich DP for splice site detection, and microexon identification with statistical significance testing. Results: On a set of human messenger RNAs with random mutations at a 1 and 3% rate, GMAP identified all splice sites accurately in over 99.3% of the sequences, which was one-tenth the error rate of existing programs. On a large set of human expressed sequence tags, GMAP provided higher-quality alignments more often than BLAT did. On a set of Arabidopsis cDNAs, GMAP performed comparably with GeneSeqer. In these experiments, GMAP demonstrated a several-fold increase in speed over existing programs. \u00a9 The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.", "citationCount": 523, "authors": [{"name": "Afgan E."}, {"name": "Baker D."}, {"name": "van den Beek M."}, {"name": "Blankenberg D."}, {"name": "Bouvier D."}, {"name": "Cech M."}, {"name": "Chilton J."}, {"name": "Clements D."}, {"name": "Coraor N."}, {"name": "Eberhard C."}, {"name": "Gruning B."}, {"name": "Guerler A."}, {"name": "Hillman-Jackson J."}, {"name": "Von Kuster G."}, {"name": "Rasche E."}, {"name": "Soranzo N."}, {"name": "Turaga N."}, {"name": "Taylor J."}, {"name": "Nekrutenko A."}, {"name": "Goecks J."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}, {"doi": "10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": null}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Galaxy Support Team", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "galaxy@pasteur.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gmap_snpindex-ip", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2015-07-23"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "TSV", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Indexing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0227"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-20T08:24:16Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Build index files for known SNPs.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [{"url": "https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/tool_runner?tool_id=toolshed.pasteur.fr/repos/fmareuil/gmap_gsnap/gmap_snpindex/2015-07-23", "note": null, "type": "Galaxy service"}], "biotoolsID": "gmap_snpindex", "additionDate": "2016-12-19T14:23:11Z", "name": "gmap_snpindex", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://research-pub.gene.com/gmap/src/README", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
