For a genome-wide mixed-model association analysis, we introduce a barebones linear model fitting function called fastLmPure from the R RcppArmadillo package for the rapid estimation of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects and the maximum likelihood values of factored spectrally transformed linear mixed models (FaST-LMM)","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31552442","name":"fastLmPure"}}
