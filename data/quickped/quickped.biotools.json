                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: The ubiquity of pedigrees in many scientific areas calls for versatile and user-friendly software. Previously published online pedigree tools have limited support for complex pedigrees and do not provide analysis of relatedness between pedigree members. Results: We introduce QuickPed, a web application for interactive pedigree creation and analysis. It supports complex inbreeding and comes with a rich built-in library of common and interesting pedigrees. The program calculates all standard coefficients of relatedness, including inbreeding, kinship and identity coefficients, and offers specialised plots for visualising relatedness. It also implements a novel algorithm for describing pairwise relationships in words. Conclusion: QuickPed is a user-friendly pedigree tool aimed at researchers, case workers and teachers. It contains a number of features not found in other similar tools, and represents a significant addition to the body of pedigree software by making advanced relatedness analyses available for non-bioinformaticians.",
