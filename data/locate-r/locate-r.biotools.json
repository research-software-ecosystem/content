In recent days with the exponential growth of known records, it becomes essential to establish new machine learning based techniques to identify the new one due to faster and cheaper solutions provided compared to laboratory methods. In this paper, we propose Locate-R, a novel method for predicting the sub-cellular location of lncRNAs. We have used only n-gapped l-mer composition and l-mer composition as features and select best 655 features to build the model. This model is based locally deep support vector machines which significantly enhance the prediction accuracy with respect to exiting state-of-the-art methods. Our predictor is readily available for use as a stand-alone web application from: http://locate-r.azurewebsites.net/.",
