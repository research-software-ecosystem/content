In current version, PmiREN contains 20388 miRNA loci (MIRs) belonging to 5757 families, 1365 clusters, 1668 syntenic blocks and 141327 predicted miRNA-target pairs in 88 species phylogenetically ranging from chlorophytes to angiosperms. In addition, 1537 deeply sequenced small RNA libraries were used in quantification of miRNA expression patterns, and 116 PARE-Seq libraries were employed to validate predicted miRNA-target pairs. PmiREN has many unique features such as annotating miRNAs with an uniform method, solid and extensive information on miRNA synteny, conservation, expression, references, and providing many convenient data accesses, powerful search and download engines. We believe PmiREN is a truly functional knowledgebase and will provide novel insights into plant miRNA research and benefit the whole research community","homepage":"http://www.pmiren.com/","name":"PmiREN"}}
