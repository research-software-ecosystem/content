      "sc:description": "A stochastic agent-based transmission chain simulation framework in R.\n\nA Forward Agent-Based Transmission Chain Simulator.\n\nThe aim of nosoi (pronounced no.si) is to provide a flexible agent-based stochastic transmission chain/epidemic simulator (Lequime et al. bioRxiv 2020.03.03.973107). It is named after the daimones of plague, sickness and disease that escaped Pandora’s jar in the Greek mythology. nosoi is able to take into account the influence of multiple variable on the transmission process (e.g. dual-host systems (such as arboviruses), within-host viral dynamics, transportation, population structure), alone or taken together, to create complex but relatively intuitive epidemiological simulations.",
