      "sc:description": "SWAM (Smartly weighted averaging across multiple tissues) is an gene expression imputation method which combines information from multiple sources to boost accuracy of imputed gene expression levels. Transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) can be used as a powerful method to identify and interpret the underlying biological mechanisms behind GWAS by mapping gene expression levels with phenotypes. In TWAS, gene expression is often imputed from individual-level genotypes of regulatory variants identified from external resources, such as Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. In this setting, a straightforward approach to impute expression levels of a specific tissue is to use the model trained from the same tissue type. When multiple tissues are available for the same subjects, it has been demonstrated that training imputation models from multiple tissue types improves the accuracy because of shared eQTLs between the tissues and increase in effective sample size.",
