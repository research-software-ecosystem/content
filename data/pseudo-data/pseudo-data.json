    "description": "Pseudo-data generation allows the statistical re-evaluation of toxicological bioassays based on summary statistics.\n\nAbstract Sometimes a re-analysis of toxicological data is useful. However, this usually requires the availability of the original data and in many cases only summary data are available in the publications. Here the generation of pseudo-data under certain assumptions using extension packages in the open-source project R on statistical computing is shown. Several case studies are used to illustrate the applicability in regulatory toxicology.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'toxicological', 'bioassays', 're-evaluation', 'open-source'",
