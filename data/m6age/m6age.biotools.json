                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2021 Wang, Guo, Huang, Yang, Hu and He.N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is one of the most prevalent RNA post-transcriptional modifications and is involved in various vital biological processes such as mRNA splicing, exporting, stability, and so on. Identifying m6A sites contributes to understanding the functional mechanism and biological significance of m6A. The existing biological experimental methods for identifying m6A sites are time-consuming and costly. Thus, developing a high confidence computational method is significant to explore m6A intrinsic characters. In this study, we propose a predictor called m6AGE which utilizes sequence-derived and graph embedding features. To the best of our knowledge, our predictor is the first to combine sequence-derived features and graph embeddings for m6A site prediction. Comparison results show that our proposed predictor achieved the best performance compared with other predictors on four public datasets across three species. On the A101 dataset, our predictor outperformed 1.34% (accuracy), 0.0227 (Matthew’s correlation coefficient), 5.63% (specificity), and 0.0081 (AUC) than comparing predictors, which indicates that m6AGE is a useful tool for m6A site prediction. The source code of m6AGE is available at https://github.com/bokunoBike/m6AGE.",
