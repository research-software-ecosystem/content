  description: scanning DNA sequence with a position weight matrix
  long_description: " The TFBS perl modules comprise a set of routines to interact\
    \ with the\n Transfac and Jaspar databases that describe a special family of proteins,\n\
    \ the transcription factors. These bind to genomic DNA to initiate (or\n prevent)\
    \ the readout of a gene.  Once multiple binding sites are known\n for a transcription\
    \ factor, these are gathered in a single file and are\n aligned in order to find\
    \ position-specific characteristica that might\n be used to predict such binding\
    \ events in novel DNA sequences.\n .\n If you use TFBS in your work, please cite\
    \ \"Lenhard B., Wasserman W.W. (2002)\n TFBS: Computational framework for transcription\
    \ factor binding site analysis.\n Bioinformatics 18:1135-1136\".\n .\n Note: the\
    \ TFBS perl module is no longer under active development.  All the\n functionality\
    \ can be found in the TFBSTools Bioconductor package; users are\n highly encouraged\
    \ to switch.  <http://bioconductor.org/packages/TFBSTools/>\n"
