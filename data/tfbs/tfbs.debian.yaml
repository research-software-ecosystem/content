description: 'The TFBS perl modules comprise a set of routines to interact with the
  Transfac and Jaspar databases that describe a special family of proteins, the transcription
  factors. These bind to genomic DNA to initiate (or prevent) the readout of a gene.
  Once multiple binding sites are known for a transcription factor, these are gathered
  in a single file and are aligned in order to find position-specific characteristica
  that might be used to predict such binding events in novel DNA sequences. . If you
  use TFBS in your work, please cite "Lenhard B., Wasserman W.W. (2002) TFBS: Computational
  framework for transcription factor binding site analysis. Bioinformatics 18:1135-1136".
  . Note: the TFBS perl module is no longer under active development. All the functionality
  can be found in the TFBSTools Bioconductor package; users are highly encouraged
  to switch. <http://bioconductor.org/packages/TFBSTools/>'
