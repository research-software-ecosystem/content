The SSM results are compared with those obtained from other protein comparison servers, and the advantages and disadvantages of different scores that are used for structure recognition are discussed. A new score, balancing the r.m.s.d. and alignment length Nalign, is proposed. It is found that different servers agree reasonably well on the new score, while showing considerable differences in r.m.s.d. and Walign. © 2004 International Union of Crystallography - all rights reserved.","authors":["Krissinel E.","Henrick K."],"cit_count":2586,"doi":"10.1107/S0907444904026460","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography","title":"Secondary-structure matching (SSM), a new tool for fast protein structure alignment in three dimensions","type":"Review","year":"2004-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pdbefold","biotoolsID":"pdbefold","description":"Identification and comparison of similar proteins based on secondary structure.","homepage":"http://pdbe.org/fold","name":"PDBeFold","version":["1"]}}
