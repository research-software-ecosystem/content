    "description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | A Bayesian approach to accurate and robust signature detection on LINCS L1000 data | Abstract LINCS L1000 dataset produced by L1000 assay contains numerous cellular expression data induced by large sets of perturbagens. Although it provides invaluable resources for drug discovery as well as understanding of disease mechanisms, severe noise in the dataset makes the detection of reliable gene expression signals difficult. Existing methods for the peak deconvolution, either k -means based or Gaussian mixture model, cannot reliably recover the accurate expression level of genes in many cases, thereby limiting their robust applications in biomedical studies. Here, we have developed a novel Bayes\u2019 theory based deconvolution algorithm that gives unbiased likelihood estimations for peak positions and characterizes the peak with a probability based z -scores",
