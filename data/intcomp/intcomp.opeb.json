Integrative analysis of heterogeneous data sources can reveal higher level interactions that cannot be detected based on individual observations. A standard integration task in cancer studies is to identify altered genomic regions that induce changes in the expression of the associated genes based on joint analysis of genome-wide gene expression and copy number profiling measurements. In this review, we highlight common approaches to genomic data integration and provide a transparent benchmarking procedure to quantitatively compare method performances in cancer gene prioritization.
