It demonstrated sound performance on publicly available expression datasets. We developed a web interface to allow potential users easy access to the MAMA classification tool. Basic and advanced options provide flexibility in exploitation. The input data format is the same as that used in most publicly available datasets. This makes the web resource particularly convenient for non-expert machine learning users working in the field of expression data analysis. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Antonov A.V.","Tetko I.V.","Prokopenko V.V.","Kosykh D.","Mewes H.W."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bth376","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"A web portal for classification of expression data using maximal margin linear programming","type":"Primary","year":"2004-11-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mdcs","biotoolsID":"mdcs","description":"The MDCS provides maximal margin Linear Programming method (Antonov et al., 2004) for classification of tumor samples based on microarray data.
