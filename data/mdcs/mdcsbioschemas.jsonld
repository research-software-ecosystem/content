  "sc:description": "The MDCS provides maximal margin Linear Programming method (Antonov et al., 2004) for classification of tumor samples based on microarray data. This procedure detects groups of genes and constructs models (features) that strongly correlate with particular tumor types. The detected features include genes whose functional relations are changed for particular cancer types.",
