In addition, we compare GraphBind with state-of-the-art methods for predicting small ligand-binding residues, including Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, ATP and HEME.\n\nGraphBind only predicts one protein chain once, please input 1-character chain ID (case sensitive) in the text boxes.",

How to accurately identify the nucleic-acid-binding residues remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an accurate predictor, GraphBind, for identifying nucleic-acid-binding residues on proteins based on an end-to-end graph neural network. Considering that binding sites often behave in highly conservative patterns on local tertiary structures, we first construct graphs based on the structural contexts of target residues and their spatial neighborhood. Then, hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) are used to embed the latent local patterns of structural and bio-physicochemical characteristics for binding residue recognition. We comprehensively evaluate GraphBind on DNA/RNA benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of GraphBind than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, GraphBind is extended to other ligand-binding residue prediction to verify its generalization capability.
