In this paper, we present a new version of the two-phase alignment algorithm for matching protein structures, called CASSERT. The algorithm can be used in scanning databases of protein structures while searching protein similarities. Effectiveness of the CASSERT was studied comparing its results to those returned by DALI algorithm. Performed tests confirm that the CASSERT algorithm exhibits high effectiveness in protein structure similarity searching and can be a useful tool in the identification of proteins and their functions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.","authors":["Mrozek D.","Malysiak-Mrozek B."],"cit_count":13,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-38865-1_34","journal":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","title":"CASSERT: A Two-Phase Alignment Algorithm for Matching 3D Structures of Proteins","type":"Primary","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gpu-cassert","biotoolsID":"gpu-cassert","description":"The GPU-based implementation of the CASSERT algorithm for protein 3D structure similarity searching.
