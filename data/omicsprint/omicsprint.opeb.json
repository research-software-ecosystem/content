Summary OmicsPrint is a versatile method for the detection of data linkage errors in multiple omics studies encompassing genetic, transcriptome and/or methylome data. OmicsPrint evaluates data linkage within and between omics data types using genotype calls from SNP arrays, DNA- or RNA-sequencing data and includes an algorithm to infer genotypes from Illumina DNA methylation array data. The method uses classification to verify assumed relationships and detect any data linkage errors, e.g. arising from sample mix-ups and mislabeling. Graphical and text output is provided to inspect and resolve putative data linkage errors. If sufficient genotype calls are available, first degree family relations also are revealed which can be used to check parent-offspring relations or zygosity in twin studies. Availability and implementation omicsPrint is available from BioConductor; http://bioconductor.org/packages/omicsPrint.
