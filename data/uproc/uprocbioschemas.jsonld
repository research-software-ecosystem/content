  "sc:description": "The toolbox implements a novel algorithm (“Mosaic Matching”) for large-scale sequence analysis and is now available in terms of an open source C library. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster than profile-based methods and achieved up to 80% higher sensitivity on unassembled short reads (100 bp) from simulated metagenomes.",
