description: 'This package uses non-parametric methods to detect rhythms in time series.
  It deals with outliers, missing values and is optimized for time series comprising
  10-100 measurements. As it does not assume expect any distinct waveform it is optimal
  or detecting oscillating behavior (e.g. circadian or cell cycle) in e.g. genome-
  or proteome-wide biological measurements such as: micro arrays, proteome mass spectrometry,
  or metabolome measurements.'
