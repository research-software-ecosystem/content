biotools_id: chippeakanno
description: The package includes functions to retrieve the sequences around the peak,
  obtain enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms, find the nearest gene, exon, miRNA or
  custom features such as most conserved elements and other transcription factor binding
  sites supplied by users. Starting 2.0.5, new functions have been added for finding
  the peaks with bi-directional promoters with summary statistics (peaksNearBDP),
  for summarizing the occurrence of motifs in peaks (summarizePatternInPeaks) and
  for adding other IDs to annotated peaks or enrichedGO (addGeneIDs). This package
  leverages the biomaRt, IRanges, Biostrings, BSgenome, GO.db, multtest and stat packages.
