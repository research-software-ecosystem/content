description: Corrects GC and mappability biases for readcounts (i.e. coverage) in
  non-overlapping windows of fixed length for single whole genome samples, yielding
  a rough estimate of copy number for furthur analysis.  Designed for rapid correction
  of high coverage whole genome tumour and normal samples.
