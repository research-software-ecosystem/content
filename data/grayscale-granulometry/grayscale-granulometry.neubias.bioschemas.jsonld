  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>This imageJ/Fiji plugin provides an analysis of the granulometry inside an image by mathematical morphology. It has sevral option for the structuring element to be used, and the size domain to be tested. The output will be both a curve of the remaining content of the image against the growing size of the structuring element, and the corresponding results table that could be then exported. It can deal with grayscale images directly, no need to segment the image first. This plugin can then be used to compare different texture based on some statistical analysis of the produced curve (for exemple comparison of the geometrical means to discriminate 2 textures). It is macro recordable as well. Programming Language: java Processes: successive erosion, dilation, closing or opening -&gt; ANALYSIS User skills: Life Scientist, developers, analysts</p>\r\n",
