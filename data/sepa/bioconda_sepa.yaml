summary: Given single-cell RNA-seq data and true experiment time of cells or pseudo-time
  cell ordering, SEPA provides convenient functions for users to assign genes into
  different gene expression patterns such as constant, monotone increasing and increasing
  then decreasing. SEPA then performs GO enrichment analysis to analysis the functional
  roles of genes with same or similar patterns.
