description: The sequence read archive (sra) is the largest public repository of sequencing
  data from the next generation of sequencing platforms including roche 454 gs system,
  illumina genome analyzer, applied biosystems solid system, helicos heliscope, and
  others. however, finding data of interest can be challenging using current tools.
  this tool is an attempt to make access to the metadata associated with submission,
  study, sample, experiment and run much more feasible.
