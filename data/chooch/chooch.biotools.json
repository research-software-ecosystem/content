                "abstract": "A Fortran program CHOOCH, which derives experimental values of the anomalous-scattering factors f\u2033 and f\u2032 from X-ray fluorescence spectra, is described. The program assumes knowledge of theoretical values for the imaginary term, f\u2033, of the anomalous-scattering factor away from the absorption edge to scale the experimental fluorescence spectrum and thus derive values of f\u2033 near the absorption edge, where tabular data are inappropriate. The Kramers - Kronig relation is used to calculate the real part, f\u2032, of the anomalous-scattering factor. The program aids the decision-making process in macro-molecular crystallographic experiments where optimal wavelength selection is required. Magnitudes of f\u2032 and f\u2033 at selected wavelengths can later be used as starting values for heavy-atom refinement with crystallographic phasing programs.",
