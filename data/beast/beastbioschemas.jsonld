  "sc:description": "The Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Sampling Trees is a cross-platform program for Bayesian analysis of molecular sequences using MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo). It is entirely orientated towards rooted, time-measured phylogenies inferred using strict or relaxed molecular clock models. It can be used as a method of reconstructing phylogenies but is also a framework for testing evolutionary hypotheses without conditioning on a single tree topology.",
