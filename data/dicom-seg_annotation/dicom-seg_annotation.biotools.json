    "description": "This module provides a command line tool to validate DICOM SEG files against predefined requirements specified in an Excel file. It contains components for finding relevant DICOM files, loading and parsing validation requests and applying validation rules. The main validation process checks each DICOM file for compliance with the Type 1, 1C, 2, 2C and 3 attributes specified in the requirements file. A detailed report is generated highlighting issues such as missing, invalid or conditionally required attributes, including file paths and affected DICOM tags. The tool is designed to ensure data integrity and compliance with DICOM standards.",
