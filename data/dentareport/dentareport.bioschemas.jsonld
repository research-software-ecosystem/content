      "sc:description": "Automated longevity and risk factor analysis in dental patient care | BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:During routine patient care practitioners have to document several aspects. However, currently it is difficult to methodically analyze the longevity of therapeutic concepts in dental private practice. Thus, the aim of the present paper was to introduce a software (Dentareport) to compare the success of different treatment options and to identify risk factors for failures in dental patient care. METHODS:Dentareport has a digital interface to automatically collect data of electronic patient files of practice management programs. By using computer-aided routines descriptive analyses of the treatments can be visualized. Dentareport also visually displays a bivariate risk factor analysis of treatment options",
