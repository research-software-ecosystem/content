    "description": "The tool performs an automatic segmentation of the possible glioblastoma tumours on MRI images and its subregions: necrosis (Intratumoral necrotic core), edema (Peritumoral vasogenic edema), enhancing (Contrast-enhancing tumor region), total (Total tumor including edema and necrosis by a single model) and total-fused (Total tumor fusioning of necrosis+edema+enhancing). It applies preprocessing steps as skull stripping, intra-patient registration, z-score normalization, patching, among others. It takes DICOM images as input and generates tumoral masks in DICOM SEG or NIFTI formats.",
