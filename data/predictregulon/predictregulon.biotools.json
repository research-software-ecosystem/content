The user selects a prokaryote genome and provides an ungapped multiple sequence alignment representing the binding site. The tool reports back with predicted binding sites and downstream co-regulated genes.",

The program allows users to submit known or experimentally determined binding sites of a regulatory protein as ungapped multiple sequence alignments. It analyses the upstream regions of all genes in a user-selected prokaryote genome and returns the potential binding sites along with the downstream co-regulated genes (operons). The known binding sites of a regulatory protein can also be used to identify its orthologue binding sites in phylogeneticaly related genomes where the trans-acting regulator protein and cognate cis-acting DNA sequences could be conserved. PredictRegulon can be freely accessed from a link on our world wide web server: http://www.cdfd.org.in/predictregulon/. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
