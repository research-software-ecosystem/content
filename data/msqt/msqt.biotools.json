                "abstract": "Motivation: One challenging aspect of genotyping and association mapping projects is often the identification of markers that are informative between groups of individuals and to convert these into genotyping assays. Results: The Multiple SNP Query Tool (MSQT) extracts SNP information from multiple sequence alignments, stores it in a database, provides a web interface to query the database and outputs SNP information in a format directly applicable for SNP-assay design. MSQT was applied to Arabidopsis thaliana sequence data to develop SNP genotyping assays that distinguish a recurrent parent (Col-0) from five other strains. SNPs with intermediate allele frequencies were also identified and developed into markers suitable for efficient genetic mapping among random pairs of wild strains. \u00a9 The Author 2007.
