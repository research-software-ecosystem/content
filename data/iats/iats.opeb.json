{"credit":[],"publication":[{"abstract":"© 2019, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.The implicit association test (IAT) is widely used in psychology. Unfortunately, the IAT cannot be run within online surveys, requiring researchers who conduct online surveys to rely on third-party tools. We introduce a novel method for constructing IATs using online survey software (Qualtrics); we then empirically assess its validity. Study 1 (student n = 239) revealed good psychometric properties, expected IAT effects, and expected correlations with explicit measures for survey-software IATs. Study 2 (MTurk n = 818) showed predicted IAT effects across four survey-software IATs (ds = 0.82 [Black–White IAT] to 2.13 [insect–flower IAT]). Study 3 (MTurk n = 270) compared survey-software IATs and IATs run via Inquisit, yielding nearly identical results and intercorrelations that would be expected for identical IATs. Survey-software IATs appear to be reliable and valid, offer numerous advantages, and make IATs accessible for researchers who use survey software to conduct online research. We present all the materials, links to tutorials, and an open-source tool that rapidly automates survey-software IAT construction and analysis.","authors":["Carpenter T.P.","Pogacar R.","Pullig C.","Kouril M.","Aguilar S.","LaBouff J.","Isenberg N.","Chakroff A."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.3758/S13428-019-01293-3","journal":"Behavior Research Methods","pmid":"31515742","title":"Survey-software implicit association tests: A methodological and empirical analysis","year":"2019-10-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:IATs","biotoolsID":"IATs","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IAT', 'Survey-software implicit association tests', 'survey-software IATs IATs', 'survey-software IATs' | Survey-software implicit association tests | The implicit association test (IAT) is widely used in psychology.
