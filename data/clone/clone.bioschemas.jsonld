      "sc:description": "Automated clustering based on local density neighborhoods for application to biomolecular structural ensembles.\n\nCLoNe - Clustering based on local density neighborhoods.\n\nCLoNe is a clustering algorithm with highly general applicability. Based on the Density Peaks algorithm from Rodriguez and Laio (Science, 2014), it improves on it by requiring a single parameter, 'pdc', that is intuitive and easy to use. 'pdc' can be incremeted if there are too many clusters, and decremented if there are not enough. Integer values between 1 and 10 are usually enough, with many values leading to the same results in most cases.",
