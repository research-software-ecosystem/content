  "sc:description": "ESTScan can detect coding regions (CDS) in DNA sequences, even if they are of low quality.  It  also detects/corrects sequencing errors that lead to frameshifts.  ESTScan is not a gene prediction program , nor is it an open reading frame detector.  In fact, its strength lies in the fact that it does not require an open reading frame to detect a coding region.  The program may miss a few translated amino acids at termini, but detects coding regions with high selectivity and sensitivity.",
