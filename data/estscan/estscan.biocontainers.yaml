description: Estscan can detect coding regions (cds) in dna sequences, even if they
  are of low quality.  it  also detects/corrects sequencing errors that lead to frameshifts.  estscan
  is not a gene prediction program , nor is it an open reading frame detector.  in
  fact, its strength lies in the fact that it does not require an open reading frame
  to detect a coding region.  the program may miss a few translated amino acids at
  termini, but detects coding regions with high selectivity and sensitivity.
