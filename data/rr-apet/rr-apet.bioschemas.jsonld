      "sc:description": "Heart rate variability analysis software.\n\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:Heart rate variability (HRV) has increasingly been linked to medical phenomena and several HRV metrics have been found to be good indicators of patient health. This has enabled generalised treatment plans to be developed in order to respond to subtle personal differences that are reflected in HRV metrics. There are several established HRV analysis platforms and methods available within the literature; some of which provide command line operation across databases but do not offer extensive graphical user interface (GUI) and editing functionality, while others offer extensive ECG editing but are not feasible over large datasets without considerable manual effort",
