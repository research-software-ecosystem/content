Purpose: PaxtoolsR package enables access to pathway data represented in the BioPAX format and made available through the Pathway Commons webservice for users of the R language to aid in advanced pathway analyses. Features include the extraction, merging and validation of pathway data represented in the BioPAX format. This package also provides novel pathway datasets and advanced querying features for R users through the Pathway Commons webservice allowing users to query, extract and retrieve data and integrate these data with local BioPAX datasets.","authors":["Luna A.","Babur O.","Aksoy B.A.","Demir E.","Sander C."],"cit_count":5,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26685306","title":"PaxtoolsR: Pathway analysis in R using Pathway Commons","year":"2016-04-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:paxtools","biotoolsID":"paxtools","description":"Java library specially designed for accessing and manipulating data in BioPAX format.
