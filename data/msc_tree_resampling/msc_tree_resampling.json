In summary (\u201ctwo-step\u201d) coalescent analyses of empirical data, researchers typically apply the bootstrap to quantify branch support for clades inferred on the optimal species tree. We tested whether site-wise bootstrap analyses provide consistently more conservative support than gene-wise bootstrap analyses. We did so using data from three empirical phylogenomic studies and employed four coalescent methods (ASTRAL, MP-EST, NJst, and STAR). We demonstrate that application of site-wise bootstrapping generally resulted in gene-trees with substantial additional conflicts relative to the original data and this approach therefore cannot be relied upon to provide conservative support. Instead the site-wise bootstrap can provide high support for apparently incorrect clades. We provide a script (https://github.com/dbsloan/msc_tree_resampling) that implements gene-wise resampling, using either the bootstrap or the jackknife, for use with ASTRAL, MP-EST, NJst, and STAR. We demonstrate that the gene-wise bootstrap outperformed the site-wise bootstrap for the primary focal clades for all four coalescent methods that were applied to all three empirical studies. For summary coalescent analyses we suggest that gene-wise resampling support should be favored over gene + site or site-wise resampling when numerous genes are sampled because site-wise resampling causes substantially greater gene-tree-estimation error.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Simmons M.P."}, {"name": "Sloan D.B."}, {"name": "Springer M.S."}, {"name": "Gatesy J."}], "date": "2019-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Daniel Sloan", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "dbsloan@rams.colostate.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:msc_tree_resampling", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/dbsloan/msc_tree_resampling", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Phylogenetic tree bootstrapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0552"}, {"term": "Phylogenetic species tree construction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0544"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-05-29T15:09:25Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tree-level bootstrap and jackknife resampling for gene-tree datasets in multispecies coalescent analysis.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "msc_tree_resampling", "additionDate": "2019-05-29T15:09:02Z", "name": "msc_tree_resampling", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
