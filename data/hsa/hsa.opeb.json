Genome-wide 3C technologies (Hi-C) are being increasingly employed to study three-dimensional (3D) genome conformations. Existing computational approaches are unable to integrate accumulating data to facilitate studying 3D chromatin structure and function. We present HSA (http://ouyanglab.jax.org/hsa/), a flexible tool that jointly analyzes multiple contact maps to infer 3D chromatin structure at the genome scale. HSA globally searches the latent structure underlying different cleavage footprints. Its robustness and accuracy outperform or rival existing tools on extensive simulations and orthogonal experiment validations. Applying HSA to recent in situ Hi-C data, we found the 3D chromatin structures are highly conserved across various human cell types.","authors":["Zou C.","Zhang Y.","Ouyang Z."],"cit_count":12,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"26936376","title":"HSA: Integrating multi-track Hi-C data for genome-scale reconstruction of 3D chromatin structure","year":"2016-03-02"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:hsa","biotoolsID":"hsa","description":"Fexible tool that can jointly analyze multiple contact maps from Hi-C experiments to infer the 3D chromatin structure of the genome.","homepage":"http://ouyanglab.jax.org/hsa/","name":"HSA"}}
