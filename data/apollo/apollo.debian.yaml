  description: genome annotation viewer and editor
  long_description: " Apollo is a genome annotation viewer and editor. It was developed
    as a\n collaboration between the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (part of\n\
    \ the FlyBase consortium) and The Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK.\n Apollo
    allows researchers to explore genomic annotations at many levels\n of detail,
    and to perform expert annotation curation, all in a graphical\n environment. It
    was used by the FlyBase biologists to construct the\n Release 3 annotations on
    the finished Drosophila melanogaster genome,\n and is also a primary vehicle for
    sharing these annotations with the\n community. The Generic Model Organism Database
    (GMOD) project, which\n aims to provide a complete ready-to-use toolkit for analyzing
    whole\n genomes, has adopted Apollo as its annotation workbench."
