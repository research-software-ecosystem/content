This paper describes a method developed for predicting GST proteins. We have used a dataset of 107 GST and 107 non-GST proteins for training and the performance of the method was evaluated with five-fold cross-validation technique. First a SVM based method has been developed using amino acid and dipeptide composition and achieved the maximum accuracy of 91.59% and 95.79% respectively. In addition we developed a SVM based method using tripeptide composition and achieved maximum accuracy 97.66% which is better than accuracy achieved by HMM based searching (96.26%). Based on above study a web-server GSTPred has been developed (http://www.imtech.res.in/ raghava/gstpred/). \u00a9 2007 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Mishra N.K."}, {"name": "Kumar M."}, {"name": "Raghava G.P.S."}], "date": "2007-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Protein and Peptide Letters"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr.G.P.S.Raghava", "url": "http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/gstpred/team.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "raghava@imtech.res.in"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gstpred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/gstpred/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Web-server specially trained for the Glutathione S-transferase protein.The prediction is based on the basis of amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, tripeptide composition by using support vector machines(SVM).", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/gstpred-prediction-of-glutathione-s-transferase-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "gstpred", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:44:49Z", "name": "GSTPred", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/gstpred/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
