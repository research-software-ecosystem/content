Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: The estimation of species phylogenies requires multiple loci, since different loci can have different trees due to incomplete lineage sorting, modeled by the multi-species coalescent model. We recently developed a coalescent-based method, ASTRAL, which is statistically consistent under the multi-species coalescent model and which is more accurate than other coalescent-based methods on the datasets we examined. ASTRAL runs in polynomial time, by constraining the search space using a set of allowed 'bipartitions'. Despite the limitation to allowed bipartitions, ASTRAL is statistically consistent. Results: We present a new version of ASTRAL, which we call ASTRAL-II. We show that ASTRAL-II has substantial advantages over ASTRAL: it is faster, can analyze much larger datasets (up to 1000 species and 1000 genes) and has substantially better accuracy under some conditions. ASTRAL's running time is O(n2k|X|2), and ASTRAL-II's running time is O(nk|X|2), where n is the number of species, k is the number of loci and X is the set of allowed bipartitions for the search space.", "citationCount": 254, "authors": [{"name": "Mirarab S."}, {"name": "Warnow T."}], "date": "2015-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Siavash Mirarab", "url": "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~smirarab/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "smirarab@ucsd.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:astral", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Phylogenetic tree generation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0323"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Java program for estimating a species tree given a set of unrooted gene trees.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/astral-4-4-4-accurate-species-tree-algorithm.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}, {"url": "https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "astral", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:00Z", "name": "ASTRAL", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/smirarab/ASTRAL", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
