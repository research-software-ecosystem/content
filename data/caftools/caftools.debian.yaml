description: This package contains code from different authors that allow sequence
  assemblies to be converted into formats such as CAF (Common Assembly Format) or
  GAP4. . CAF is a text format for describing sequence assemblies. It is acedb-compliant
  and is an extension of the ace-file format used earlier, but with support for base
  quality measures and a more extensive description of the Sequence data. CAF was
  designed during the Sanger sequencing era. Its modern-day successor is the SAM format,
  or its binary equivalents BAM and CRAM.
