                "abstract": "© The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.Tuberculosis is a global menace, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. In the era of drug-resistant tuberculosis, peptide-based therapeutics may provide alternate to small molecule based drugs. In order to create knowledgebase, AntiTbPdb (http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/antitbpdb/), experimentally validated anti-tubercular and anti-mycobacterial peptides were compiled from literature. We curate 10 652 research articles and 35 patents to extract anti-tubercular peptides and annotate these peptides manually. This knowledgebase has 1010 entries, each entry provides extensive information about an anti-tubercular peptide such as sequence, chemical modification, chirality, nature and source of origin. The tertiary structure of these anti-tubercular peptides containing natural as well as chemically modified residues was predicted using PEPstrMOD and I-TASSER. In addition to structural information, database maintains other properties of peptides like physiochemical properties. Numerous web-based tools have been integrated for data retrieval, browsing, sequence similarity search and peptide mapping. In order to assist wide range of user, we developed a responsive website suitable for smartphone, tablet and desktop.",
