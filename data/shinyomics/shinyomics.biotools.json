    "description": "collaborative exploration of omics-data.\n\nThis app allows exploratory data analysis on any 'Omics' dataset, e.g. Transcriptomics, proteomics, phenotypic screens. It comes with pre-loaded datasets from the human pathogens Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The S. pneumoniae set includes RNA-Seq and Tn-seq data from Zhu et al 2019 (under review) where two strains (19F and T4) were treated with 5 different antibiotics (KAN, LVX, VNC, RIF, PEN). The M. tuberculosis datasets are microarray and proteomic screens under hypoxic conditions\n\nShinyOmics: Exploration of 'Omics' data.",

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s).Background: Omics-profiling is a collection of increasingly prominent approaches that result in large-scale biological datasets, for instance capturing an organism's behavior and response in an environment. It can be daunting to manually analyze and interpret such large datasets without some programming experience. Additionally, with increasing amounts of data; management, storage and sharing challenges arise. Results: Here, we present ShinyOmics, a web-based application that allows rapid collaborative exploration of omics-data. By using Tn-Seq, RNA-Seq, microarray and proteomics datasets from two human pathogens, we exemplify several conclusions that can be drawn from a rich dataset. We identify a protease and several chaperone proteins upregulated under aminoglycoside stress, show that antibiotics with the same mechanism of action trigger similar transcriptomic responses, point out the dissimilarity in different omics-profiles, and overlay the transcriptional response on a metabolic network. Conclusions: ShinyOmics is easy to set up and customize, and can utilize user supplied metadata. It offers several visualization and comparison options that are designed to assist in novel hypothesis generation, as well as data management, online sharing and exploration. Moreover, ShinyOmics can be used as an interactive supplement accompanying research articles or presentations.",
