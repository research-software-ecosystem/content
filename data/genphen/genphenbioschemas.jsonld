  "sc:description": "This tool conducts genetic association studies by using statistical learning techniques such as random forests and support vector machines, as well as Bayesian inference with hierarchical models. It alleviates the multiple hypothesis problems and the need for P value corrections, which often lead to massive numbers of false negatives.",
