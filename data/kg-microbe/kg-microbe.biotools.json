    "description": "KG-Microbe is a standardized, interoperable framework for constructing modular microbial knowledge graphs that harmonize information about bacteria and archaea, e.g., organismal traits, environments and growth preferences, media, assays, and genome annotations. Starting from a core KG, the framework generates a hierarchy of related KGs ranging from millions to over 0.5 billion edges (KG-Microbe-Core, -Biomedical, -Function, -Biomedical-Function) structured according to the Biolink Model. KG-Microbe supports customizable taxa subsets and host organisms. The framework uses standard TSV formats but also outputs n-triples.",
