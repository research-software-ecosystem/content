      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ANNIS', 'corpus' | A richly annotated longitudinal corpus of German texts written by primary school children | Welcome to the Litkey Corpus, a longitudinal corpus of picture story descriptions produced by German primary school children from grades 2 to 4. Litkey is short for “Literacy as the key to social participation: Psycholinguistic perspectives on orthography instruction and literacy acquisition” and refers to the research project in which the corpus was created. Here you can find a general description of the aims of the project and the four project strands that are involved. In the strand Corpus Analysis, we investigate the relationship between spelling errors of beginning writers and the orthographic properties of words based on the Litkey Corpus. You can find out more about the strand Corpus Analysis here",
