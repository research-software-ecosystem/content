      "sc:description": "General Analysis Utilities for Dynamic Omics Datasets.\n\nMathIOmica is a package for bioinformatics, written in the Wolfram language, that provides multiple utilities to facilitate the analysis of longitudinal data generated from omics experiments, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data, as well as any generalized time series. MathIOmica uses Mathematica's notebook interface, wherein users can import longitudinal datasets, carry out quality control and normalization, generate time series, and classify temporal trends. MathIOmica provides spectral methods based on periodograms and autocorrelations for automatically detecting classes of temporal behavior and allowing the user to visualize collective temporal behavior, and also assess biological significance through Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses. MathIOmica's time-series classification methods address common issues including missing data and uneven sampling in measurements.",
