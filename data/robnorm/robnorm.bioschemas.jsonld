      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PQN', 'Windham', 'eGTEx' | Model-Based Robust Normalization for High-Throughput Proteomics from Mass Spectrometry Platform | Abstract Motivation In the analysis of proteomics data from mass spectrometry (MS), normalization is an important preprocessing step to correct sample-level variation and make abundance measurements for each specific protein comparable across different samples. Under heterogeneous samples such as in the Phase I study of the Enhancing Genotype-Tissue Expression (eGTEx) project (Jiang, et al., 2019), the samples coming from 32 different tissues, and without prior housekeeping protein information or spike-ins, how to robustly correct the bias but keep tissue internal variations becomes a challenging question. Majority of previous normalization methods cannot guarantee a robust and tissue adaptive correction",
