                "abstract": "PBSword is a web server designed for efficient and accurate comparisons and searches of geometrically similar protein-protein binding sites from a large-scale database. The basic idea of PBSword is that each protein binding site is first represented by a high-dimensional vector of 'visual words', which characterizes both the global and local shape features of the binding site. It then uses a scalable indexing technique to search for those binding sites whose visual words representations are similar to that of the query binding site. Our system is able to return ranked results of binding sites in short time from a database of 194322 domain-domain binding sites. PBSword supports query by protein ID and by new structures uploaded by users. PBSword is a useful tool to investigate functional connections among proteins based on the local structures of binding site and has potential applications to protein-protein docking and drug discovery. The system is hosted at http://pbs.rnet.missouri.edu. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).",
