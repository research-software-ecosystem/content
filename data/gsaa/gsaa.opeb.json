We developed GSAASeqSP, a novel toolset for genome-wide gene set association analysis of sequence count data. This toolset offers a variety of statistical procedures via combinations of multiple gene-level and gene set-level statistics, each having their own strengths under different sample and experimental conditions. These methods can be employed independently, or results generated from multiple or all methods can be integrated to determine more robust profiles of significantly altered biological pathways. Using simulations, we demonstrate the ability of these methods to identify association signals and to measure the strength of the association. We show that GSAASeqSP analyses of RNA-Seq data from diverse tissue samples provide meaningful insights into the biological mechanisms that differentiate these samples. GSAASeqSP is a powerful platform for investigating molecular underpinnings of complex traits and diseases arising from differential activity within the biological pathways. GSAASeqSP is available at http://gsaa.unc.edu.","authors":["Xiong Q.","Mukherjee S.","Furey T.S."],"cit_count":28,"journal":"Scientific Reports","pmid":"25213199","title":"GSAASeqSP: A toolset for gene set association analysis of RNA-Seq data","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gsaa","biotoolsID":"gsaa","description":"Computational method that integrates gene expression analysis with genome wide association studies to determine whether an a priori defined sets of genes shows statistically significant, concordant differences with respect to gene expression profiles and genotypes between two biological states.
