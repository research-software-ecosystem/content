The software is written in the cross-platform Python programming language, and features include generating virtual libraries in one-dimensional SMILES and three-dimensional SDF formats, suitable for virtual screening. The stand-alone software is capable of filtering the virtual libraries using empirical measurements, including peptide synthesizability by standard peptide synthesis techniques, stability, and the druglike properties of the peptide. The software and accompanying Web interface is designed to enable the rapid generation of large, structurally diverse, synthesizable virtual libraries of constrained peptides quickly and conveniently, for use in virtual screening experiments. The stand-alone software, and the Web interface for evaluating these empirical properties of a single peptide, are available at http://bioware.ucd.ie. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.", "citationCount": 15, "authors": [{"name": "Duffy F.J."}, {"name": "Verniere M."}, {"name": "Devocelle M."}, {"name": "Bernard E."}, {"name": "Shields D.C."}, {"name": "Chubb A.J."}], "date": "2011-04-25T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bioinfo-casl.ucd.ie/shields/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cyclops", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.32"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioware.ucd.ie/~cyclops/cgi-bin/webpep.cgi", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "CycloPsWeb generates structures for and displays properties of cyclised and linear peptides.
