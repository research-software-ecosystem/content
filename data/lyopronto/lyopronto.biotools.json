    "description": "An Open-Source Lyophilization Process Optimization Tool.\n\nThis work presents a new user-friendly lyophilization simulation and process optimization tool, freely available under the name LyoPRONTO. This tool comprises freezing and primary drying calculators, a design-space generator, and a primary drying optimizer. The freezing calculator performs 0D lumped capacitance modeling to predict the product temperature variation with time which shows reasonably good agreement with experimental measurements. The primary drying calculator performs 1D heat and mass transfer analysis in a vial and predicts the drying time with an average deviation of 3% from experiments. The calculator is also extended to generate a design space over a range of chamber pressures and shelf temperatures to predict the most optimal setpoints for operation.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'drying', 'calculator', 'freezing', 'optimizer'",
