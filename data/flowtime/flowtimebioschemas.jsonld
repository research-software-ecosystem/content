  "sc:description": "This package was developed for analysis of both dynamic and steady state experiments examining the function of gene regulatory networks in yeast (strain W303) expressing fluorescent reporter proteins using a BD Accuri C6 and SORP cytometers. However, the functions are for the most part general and may be adapted for analysis of other organisms using other flow cytometers.",
