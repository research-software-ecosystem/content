This work aims to systematically evaluate recent advanced graph embedding techniques on biomedical tasks. We compile 5 benchmark datasets for 4 biomedical prediction tasks (see paper for details) and use them to evaluate 11 representative graph embedding methods selected from different categories:.\n\n5 matrix factorization-based: Laplacian Eigenmap, SVD, Graph Factorization, HOPE, GraRep.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'BioNEV'",
