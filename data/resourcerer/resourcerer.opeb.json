Although such studies provide a tremendous resource for understanding human disease states, one of the significant challenges is cross-referencing the data derived from different species, across diverse expression analysis platforms, in order to properly derive inferences regarding gene expression and disease state. To address this problem, we have developed RESOURCERER, a microarray-resource annotation and cross-reference database built using the analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and gene sequences provided by the TIGR Gene Index (TGI) and TIGR Orthologous Gene Alignment (TOGA) databases.","authors":["Tsai J.","Sultana R.","Lee Y.","Pertea G.","Karamycheva S.","Antonescu V.","Cho J.","Parvizi B.","Cheung F.","Quackenbush J."],"cit_count":82,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"16173164","title":"Resourcerer: A database for annotating and linking microarray resources within and across species","year":"2001-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:resourcerer","biotoolsID":"resourcerer","description":"Tool for cross-referencing microarray data derived from different species and across different expression analysis platforms.
