Background: Metal ions play a critical role in the stabilization of RNA structures. Therefore, accurate prediction of the ion effects in RNA folding can have a far-reaching impact on our understanding of RNA structure and function. Multivalent ions, especially Mg2+, are essential for RNA tertiary structure formation. These ions can possibly become strongly correlated in the close vicinity of RNA surface. Most of the currently available software packages, which have widespread success in predicting ion effects in biomolecular systems, however, do not explicitly account for the ion correlation effect. Therefore, it is important to develop a software package/web server for the prediction of ion electrostatics in RNA folding by including ion correlation effects. Results: The TBI web server http://rna.physics.missouri.edu/tbi index.html provides predictions for the total electrostatic free energy, the different free energy components, and the mean number and the most probable distributions of the bound ions. A novel feature of the TBI server is its ability to account for ion correlation and ion distribution fluctuation effects. Conclusions: By accounting for the ion correlation and fluctuation effects, the TBI server is a unique online tool for computing ion-mediated electrostatic properties for given RNA structures. The results can provide important data for in-depth analysis for ion effects in RNA folding including the ion-dependence of folding stability, ion uptake in the folding process, and the interplay between the different energetic components.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Zhu Y."}, {"name": "He Z."}, {"name": "Chen S.-J."}], "date": "2015-03-23T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://vfold.missouri.edu/index.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tbi", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rna.physics.missouri.edu/MCTBI/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2481"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "TBI (Tightly Bound Ion Model ) predicts the electrostatic free energy, the different free energy components, the average binding fraction of ions, and the most probable ion binding modes for a given RNA structure (provided in the PDB format) in a salt solution of given ion concentrations.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/tbi-predicting-ion-effects-in-rna-folding.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "tbi", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:02:33Z", "name": "TBI", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://rna.physics.missouri.edu/MCTBI/userguide.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
