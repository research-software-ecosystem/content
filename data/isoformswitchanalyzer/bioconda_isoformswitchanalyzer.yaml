description: IsoformSwitchAnalyzeR enables identification and analysis of alternative
  splicing and isoform switches with predicted functional consequences (e.g. gain/loss
  of protein domains etc.) from quantification of all types of RNASeq by tools such
  as Kallisto, Salmon, Cufflinks/Cuffdiff, RSEM etc.
