Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.VarSelLCM allows a full model selection (detection of the relevant features for clustering and selection of the number of clusters) in model-based clustering, according to classical information criteria. Data to be analyzed can be composed of continuous, integer and/or categorical features. Moreover, missing values are managed, without any pre-processing, by the model used to cluster with the assumption that values are missing completely at random. Thus, VarSelLCM also allows data imputation by using mixture models. A Shiny application is implemented to easily interpret the clustering results.","authors":["Marbac M.","Sedki M."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty786","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"30192923","title":"VarSelLCM: An R/C++ package for variable selection in model-based clustering of mixed-data with missing values","type":"Primary","year":"2019-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:VarSelLCM","biotoolsID":"VarSelLCM","description":"Package for variable selection in model-based clustering of mixed-data with missing values.","homepage":"https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=VarSelLCM/","name":"VarSelLCM","version":["2.1.3"]}}
