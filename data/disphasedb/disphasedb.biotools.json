The recent explosion of research in the area still lacks tools for the analysis and data integration among different repositories. Currently, there is not a comprehensive and dedicated database that collects all disease-related variations in combination with the protein location, biological role in the MLO, and all the metadata available for each protein and disease. Disease-related protein variants and additional features are dispersed and the user has to navigate many databases, with a different focus, formats, and often not user friendly. Results: We present DisPhaseDB, a database dedicated to disease-related variants of liquid–liquid phase separation proteins. It integrates 10 databases, contains 5,741 proteins, 1,660,059 variants, and 4,051 disease terms. It also offers intuitive navigation and an informative display. It constitutes a pivotal starting point for further analysis, encouraging the development of new computational tools. The database is freely available at http://disphasedb.leloir.org.ar.",
