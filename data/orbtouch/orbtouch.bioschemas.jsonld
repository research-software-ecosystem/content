  "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Deformable Interface for Human Touch Recognition Using Stretchable Carbon Nanotube Dielectric Elastomer Sensors and Deep Neural Networks | This article presents a machine learning approach to map outputs from an embedded array of sensors distributed throughout a deformable body to continuous and discrete virtual states, and its application to interpret human touch in soft interfaces. We integrate stretchable capacitors into a rubber membrane, and use a passive addressing scheme to probe sensor arrays in real time. To process the signals from this array, we feed capacitor measurements into convolutional neural networks that classify and localize touch events on the interface. We implement this concept with a device called OrbTouch",
