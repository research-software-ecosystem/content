      "sc:description": "distinct is a general method for differential analysis of full distributions that is well suited to applications on single-cell data, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and high-dimensional flow or mass cytometry (HDCyto) data. distinct is based on a hierarchical non-parametric permutation approach and, by comparing empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDFs), identifies both differential patterns involving changes in the mean as well as more subtle variations that do not involve the mean.",
