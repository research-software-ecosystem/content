    "description": "A Space-Time Cluster Analysis R Package for Individual-level Data.\n\nBACKGROUND:Until recently, large individual-level longitudinal data were unavailable to investigate clusters of disease, driving a need for suitable statistical tools. We introduce a robust, efficient, intuitive R package, ClustR, for space-time cluster analysis of individual-level data. METHODS:We developed ClustR and evaluated the tool using a simulated dataset mirroring the population of California with constructed clusters. We assessed ClustR's performance under various conditions and compared it to another space-time clustering algorithm: SaTScan. RESULTS:ClustR mostly exhibited high sensitivity for urban clusters and low sensitivity for rural clusters. Specificity was generally high. Compared to SaTScan, ClustR ran faster and demonstrated similar sensitivity, but had lower specificity. Select cluster types were detected better by ClustR than SaTScan and vice versa.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
