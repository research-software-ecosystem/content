Currently it supports different kind of alignments:.\n\nA Linux platform with CUDA toolkit 8 or higher is required, along with usual build environment for C and C++ code. GASAL2 has been tested over NVIDIA GPUs with compute capabilities of 2.0, 3.5 and 5.0. Although lower versions of the CUDA framework might work, they have not been tested",
