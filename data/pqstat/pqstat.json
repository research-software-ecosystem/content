    "description": "The CutL method compared to Kulldorff's scan statistic.\n\nPrecision and Quality of Statistical Analysis.\n\nPQStat is an application which enables users to carry out a statistical data analysis in a simple and accurate way.\n\nData analysis (support) tools created for the PQStat are traditional statistics used mainly in social, biomedical and technical researches. The basic statistics have been enriched with the newest algorithms that have enabled using so called exact solutions. This way, we have added the exact equivalents of the statistical tests based in the asymptotic distributions (large frequency distribution).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PQScut', 'Searching space-time clusters', 'CutL', 'Kulldorff'",

The aim of this work was to extend the application of the CutL method, which is used for detecting spatial clusters of any shape, to detecting space-time clusters, and to show how the method works compared to Kulldorff\u2019s scan statistic. In the CutL method, clusters with disease incidence rates higher than the one entered by the researcher are searched for. The way in which the space-time version of that method works is illustrated with the example of data simulating the distribution of people affected by health problems in Polish counties in the period 2013-2017. With respect to detection of irregularly shaped space-time clusters, the CutL method turned out to be more effective than Kulldorff\u2019s scan statistic; for cylinder-shaped space-time clusters, the two methods produced similar results. The CutL method has also the important advantage of being widely accessible through the PQScut and PQStat programmes (PQStat Software Company, Poznan, Poland).",
