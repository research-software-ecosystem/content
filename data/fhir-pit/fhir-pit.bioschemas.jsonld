      "sc:description": "FHIR PIT (Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources Patient data Integration Tool) is an open software application for spatiotemporal integration of clinical data and environmental exposures data. FHIR PIT (Patient data Integration Tool) uses geocodes and time stamps of varying resolution (e.g., hour, year) to integrate the clinical data with environmental exposures data from multiple sources before stripping the data of PHI (including the geocodes and time stamps) and binning feature variables to create ICEES tables. Of note, FHIR PIT is modular and extensible and can be adapted for virtually any type of data that requires geocodes and dates for integration with personally identifiable information.",
