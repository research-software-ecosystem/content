Its aim is to collate information from a wide range of sources to provide clues to the functions of the approximately 1500 gene products that have no confirmed cellular function. The database is built on an enhanced annotation of the updated genome sequence of strain MG1655 and the association of experimental data with the E.coli genes and their products. Experiments that can be held within EchoBASE include proteomics studies, microarray data, protein-protein interaction data, structural data and bioinformatics studies. EchoBASE also contains annotated information on 'orphan' enzyme activities from this microbe to aid characterization of the proteins that catalyse these elusive biochemical reactions. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.","authors":["Misra R.V.","Horler R.S.P.","Reindl W.","Goryanin I.I.","Thomas G.H."],"cit_count":58,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gki028","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15608209","title":"EchoBASE: An integrated post-genomic database for Escherichia coli","type":"Primary","year":"2005-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:echobase","biotoolsID":"echobase","description":"A database that curates new experimental and bioinformatic information about the genes and gene products of the model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 strain MG1655.","homepage":"http://www.york.ac.uk/res/thomas/","name":"EchoBASE"}}
