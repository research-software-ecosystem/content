    "description": "2-dimensional convolutional neural network on graph representation of synthetic sequences from massive-throughput assay.\n\nAbstract In recent years, a pipeline of massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) provided large-scale datasets to investigate biological mechanisms in detail. However, bigger data often leads to larger complexity. As a result, theories derived from low-throughput experiments lose explanatory power, requiring new methods to create predictive models. Here we focus on modeling functions of nucleic acid sequences, as a study case of massive-throughput assays. We report a deep learning approach, training a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) on an ordered graph representation of nucleic acid sequences to predict their functions (Seq2DFunc). To compare the performance of Seq2DFunc with conventional methods, we obtained customized database on a CRISPR RNA processing assay.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
