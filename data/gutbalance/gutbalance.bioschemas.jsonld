      "sc:description": "A server for the human gut microbiome-based disease prediction and biomarker discovery with compositionality addressed.\n\nThe compositionality of the microbiome data is well-known but often neglected. The compositional transformation pertains to the supervised learning of microbiome data and is a critical step that decides the performance and reliability of the disease classifiers. We value the excellent performance of the distal discriminative balance analysis (DBA) method, which selects distal balances of pairs and trios of bacteria, in addressing the classification of high-dimensional microbiome data. By applying this method to the species-level abundances of all the disease phenotypes in the GMrepo database, we build a balance-based model repository for the classification of human gut microbiome-related diseases. The model repository supports the prediction of disease risks for new sample(s)",
