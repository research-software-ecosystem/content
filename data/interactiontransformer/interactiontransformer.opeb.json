For those capabilities, please see the SAFE Transformer package (https://github.com/ModelOriented/SAFE). Our package does have an experimental feature that will iteratively call InteractionTransformer and SAFETransformer to develop multi-layer interactions/transformation models, but this is still under development.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Don t Dismiss Logistic Regression'",
