The base-pairing between the 5\u2032-end of miRNA and the target mRNA 3\u2032-UTRs is essential for the miRNA:mRNA recognition. Recent studies show that many seed matches in 3\u2032-UTRs, which are fully complementary to miRNA 5\u2032-ends, are highly conserved. Based on these features, a two-stage strategy can be implemented to achieve the de novo identification of miRNAs by requiring the complete base-pairing between the 5\u2032-end of miRNA candidates and the potential seed matches in 3\u2032-UTRs. Results: We presented a new method, which combined multiple pairwise conservation information, to identify the frequently-occurred and conserved 7-mers in 3\u2032-UTRs. A pairwise conservation score (PCS) was introduced to describe the conservation of all 7-mers in 3\u2032-UTRs between any two Drosophila species. Using PCSs computed from 6 pairs of flies, we developed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier ensemble, named Cons-SVM and identified 689 conserved 7-mers including 63 seed matches covering 32 out of 38 known miRNA families in the reference dataset. In the second stage, we searched for 90 nt conserved stem-loop regions containing the complementary sequences to the identified 7-mers and used the previously published miRNA prediction software to analyze these stem-loops. We predicted 47 miRNA candidates in the genome-wide screen. Conclusion: Cons-SVM takes advantage of the independent evolutionary information from the 6 pairs of flies and shows high sensitivity in identifying seed matches in 3\u2032-UTRs. Combining the multiple pairwise conservation information by the machine learning approach, we finally identified 47 miRNA candidates in D. melanogaster. \u00a9 2007 Gu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 13, "authors": [{"name": "Gu J."}, {"name": "Fu H."}, {"name": "Zhang X."}, {"name": "Li Y."}], "date": "2007-11-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jin Gu", "url": "http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/jgu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jgu@tsinghua.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pcs", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/software/pcs/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pairwise sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0491"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Stand-alone pakage to identify and analyze conserved k-mers in pairwise alignment.
