Protease inhibitors in plants are naturally occurring proteins that inhibit the function of endogenous and exogenous proteases. In this paper the design and development of a web framework providing a clear and very flexible way of querying plant protease inhibitors data is reported. The web resource is based on a relational database, containing data of plants protease inhibitors publicly accessible, and a graphical user interface providing all the necessary browsing tools, including a data exporting function. PlantPIs contains information extracted principally from MEROPS database, filtered, annotated and compared with data stored in other protein and gene public databases, using both automated techniques and domain expert evaluations. The data are organized to allow a flexible and easy way to access stored information. The database is accessible at http://www.plantpis.ba.itb.cnr.it/. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.",
