Protease inhibitors in plants are naturally occurring proteins that inhibit the function of endogenous and exogenous proteases. PlantPIs contains information extracted principally from MEROPS database, filtered, annotated and compared with data stored in other protein and gene public databases, using both automated techniques and domain expert evaluations.",
