                "abstract": "Background: Understanding the role of various factors in 3D genome organization is essential to determine their impact on shaping large-scale chromatin units such as euchromatin (A) and heterochromatin (B) compartments. At this level, chromatin compaction is extensively modulated when transcription and epigenetic profiles change upon cell differentiation and response to various external impacts. However, detailed analysis of chromatin contact patterns within and between compartments is complicated because of a lack of suitable computational methods. Results: We developed a tool, Pentad, to perform calculation, visualisation and quantitative analysis of the average chromatin compartment from the Hi-C matrices in cis, trans, and specified genomic distances. As we demonstrated by applying Pentad to publicly available Hi-C datasets, it helps to reliably detect redistribution of contact frequency in the chromatin compartments and assess alterations in the compartment strength. Conclusions: Pentad is a simple tool for the analysis of changes in chromatin compartmentalization in various biological conditions.
