Currently providing >150 million binary interaction evidences from 28 servers globally, the PSICQUIC interface allows the concurrent search of multiple molecular-interaction information resources using a single query. Here, we present an extension of the PSICQUIC specification (version 1.3), which has been released to be compliant with the enhanced standards in molecular interactions. The new release also includes a new reference implementation of the PSICQUIC server available to the data providers. It offers augmented web service capabilities and improves the user experience. PSICQUIC has been running for almost 5 years, with a user base growing from only 4 data providers to 28 (April 2013) allowing access to 151 310 109 binary interactions. The power of this web service is shown in PSICQUIC View web application, an example of how to simultaneously query, browse and download results from the different PSICQUIC servers. This application is free and open to all users with no login requirement (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/psicquic/view/main.xhtml).","authors":["del-Toro N.","Dumousseau M.","Orchard S.","Jimenez R.C.","Galeota E.","Launay G.","Goll J.","Breuer K.","Ono K.","Salwinski L.","Hermjakob H."],"cit_count":44,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23671334","title":"A new reference implementation of the PSICQUIC web service.","type":"Other","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:psicquic","biotoolsID":"psicquic","description":"Project within the HUPO Proteomics Standard Initiative (HUPO-PSI) that standardises programmatic access to molecular interaction databases.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PSICQUIC.html","name":"PSICQUIC","version":["1.12.0"]}}
