Inference is based on bootstrap methodology.\n\nConstrained Inference for Linear Mixed Effects Models.\n\nEstimation and inference for linear models where some or all of the fixed-effects coefficients are subject to order restrictions. This package uses the robust residual bootstrap methodology for inference, and can handle some structure in the residual variance matrix.",

All rights reserved.In many applications researchers are typically interested in testing for inequality constraints in the context of linear fixed effects and mixed effects models. Although there exists a large body of literature for performing statistical inference under inequality constraints, user friendly statistical software implementing such methods is lacking, especially in the context of linear fixed and mixed effects models. In this article we introduce CLME, a package in the R language that can be used for testing a broad collection of inequality constraints. It uses residual bootstrap based methodology which is reasonably robust to non-normality as well as heteroscedasticity. The package is illustrated using two data sets. The package also contains a graphical user interface built using the shiny package.",
