The metal ion zinc is critically involved in universal biological processes, ranging from protein-DNA complexes and transcription regulation to enzymatic catalysis and metabolic pathways. Proteins have evolved a series of motifs to specifically recognize and bind zinc ions. Many of these, so called zinc fingers, are structurally independent globular domains with discontinuous binding motifs made up of residues mostly far apart in sequence. Through a systematic approach starting from the BRIX structure fragment database, we discovered that there exists another predictable subset of zinc-binding motifs that not only have a conserved continuous sequence pattern but also share a characteristic local conformation, despite being included in totally different overall folds. While this does not allow general prediction of all Zn binding motifs, a HMM-based web server, Huf-Zinc, is available for prediction of these novel, as well as conventional, zinc finger motifs in protein sequences. The Huf-Zinc webserver can be freely accessed through this URL (). \u00a9 2013 Imperial College Press.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Maurer-Stroh S."}, {"name": "Gao H."}, {"name": "Han H."}, {"name": "Baeten L."}, {"name": "Schymkowitz J."}, {"name": "Rousseau F."}, {"name": "Zhang L."}, {"name": "Eisenhaber F."}], "date": "2013-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.bii.a-star.edu.sg/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "enquiry@bii.a-star.edu.sg"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:huf-zinc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/METHODS/hufzinc/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structural motif recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0245"}, {"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:18:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "HMM-based web server for prediction of the novel, as well as conventional, zinc finger motifs in protein sequences.", "toolType": ["Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/huf-zinc-hmm-based-u-shape-motif-finder-for-zinc-binding.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "huf-zinc", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:46:12Z", "name": "HUF-ZINC", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://mendel.bii.a-star.edu.sg/METHODS/hufzinc/hufzinc_help.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
