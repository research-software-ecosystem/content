With this opportunity, however, researchers are faced with the challenge of how to best analyze and interpret their genome-scale datasets. A powerful way of representing genome-scale data is as feature-specific coordinates relative to reference genome assemblies, i.e. as genomic tracks. The Genomic HyperBrowser (http://hyperbrowser.uio.no) is an open-ended web server for the analysis of genomic track data. Through the provision of several highly customizable components for processing and statistical analysis of genomic tracks, the HyperBrowser opens for a range of genomic investigations, related to, e.g., gene regulation, disease association or epigenetic modifications of the genome.","authors":["Sandve G.K.","Gundersen S.","Johansen M.","Glad I.K.","Gunathasan K.","Holden L.","Holden M.","Liestol K.","Nygard S.","Nygaard V.","Paulsen J.","Rydbeck H.","Trengereid K.","Clancy T.","Drablos F.","Ferkingstad E.","Kalas M.","Lien T.","Rye M.B.","Frigessi A.","Hovig E."],"cit_count":23,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"23632163","title":"The Genomic HyperBrowser: an analysis web server for genome-scale data.","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:genomic_hyperbrowser","biotoolsID":"genomic_hyperbrowser","description":"The Genomic HyperBrowser is a web server for the analysis of genomic track data (e.g. using feature-specific coordinates relative to reference genome assemblies).","homepage":"http://hyperbrowser.uio.no","name":"Genomic HyperBrowser"}}
