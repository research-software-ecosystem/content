Therefore, obtaining the distribution of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in promoters is a key step to further understand the relationship between promoter methylation and mRNA gene expression regulation. Large-scale detection of DNA 5mC through wet experiments is still time-consuming and laborious. Therefore, it is urgent to design a method for identifying the 5mC site of genome-wide DNA promoters. Based on promoter methylation data of the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from the database named cancer cell line Encyclopedia (CCLE), we built a fusion decision predictor called iPromoter-5mC for identifying methylation modification sites in promoters using deep neural network (DNN). One-Hot Encoding (One-hot) was used to encode the promoter samples for the classification. The method achieves average AUC of 0.957 on the independent testing dataset, indicating that our predictor is robust and reliable. A user-friendly web-server called iPromoter-5mC could be freely accessible at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPromoter-5mC, which will provide simple and effective means for users to study promoter 5mC modification. The source code of the proposed methods is freely available for academic research at https://github.com/zlwuxi/iPromoter-5mC.",
