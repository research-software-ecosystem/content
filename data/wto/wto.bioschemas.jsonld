      "sc:description": "Assessment of weighted topological overlap (wTO) to improve fidelity of gene co-expression networks.\n\nFor more than a decade, gene expression data sets have been used as basis for the construction of co-expression networks used in systems biology investigations, leading to many important discoveries in a wide range of subjects spanning human disease to evolution and the development of organisms. A commonly encountered challenge in such investigations is first that of detecting, then subsequently removing, spurious correlations (i.e. links) in these networks. While access to a large number of measurements per gene would reduce this problem, often only a small number of measurements are available. The weighted Topological Overlap (wTO) measure, which incorporates information from the shared network-neighborhood of a given gene-pair into a single score, is a metric that is frequently used with the implicit expectation of producing higher-quality networks",
