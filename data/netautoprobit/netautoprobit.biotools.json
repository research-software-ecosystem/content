                "abstract": "Predicting the functional roles of proteins based on various genome-wide data, such as protein-protein association networks, has become a canonical problem in computational biology. Approaching this task as a binary classification problem, we develop a network-based extension of the spatial auto-probit model. In particular, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian probit-based framework for modeling binary network-indexed processes, with a latent multivariate conditional autoregressive Gaussian process. The latter allows for the easy incorporation of protein-protein association network topologies-either binary or weighted-in modeling protein functional similarity. We use this framework to predict protein functions, for functions defined as terms in the Gene Ontology (GO) database, a popular rigorous vocabulary for biological functionality. Furthermore, we show how a natural extension of this framework can be used to model and correct for the high percentage of false negative labels in training data derived from GO, a serious shortcoming endemic to biological databases of this type. Our method performance is evaluated and compared with standard algorithms on weighted yeast protein-protein association networks, extracted from a recently developed integrative database called Search Tool for the Retrieval of INteracting Genes/proteins (STRING). Results show that our basic method is competitive with these other methods, and that the extended method-incorporating the uncertainty in negative labels among the training data-can yield nontrivial improvements in predictive accuracy. \u00a9 2010, The International Biometric Society.",
