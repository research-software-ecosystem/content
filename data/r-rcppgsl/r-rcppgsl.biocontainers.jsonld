  "schema1:description": "Rcpp integration for GNU GSL vectors and matrices The GNU Scientific Library (or GSL) is a collection of numerical routines for scientific computing. It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it provides a standard C interface to a wide range of mathematical routines. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite. The RcppGSL package provides an easy-to-use interface between GSL data structures and R using concepts from Rcpp which is itself a package that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves as a prime example of how to build a package that uses Rcpp to connect to another third-party library. The autoconf script, inline plugin and example package can all be used as a stanza to write a similar package against another library.",
