description: Rcpp integration for GNU GSL vectors and matrices The GNU Scientific
  Library (or GSL) is a collection of numerical routines for scientific computing.
  It is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it provides a standard C interface
  to a wide range of mathematical routines. There are over 1000 functions in total
  with an extensive test suite. The RcppGSL package provides an easy-to-use interface
  between GSL data structures and R using concepts from Rcpp which is itself a package
  that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves as a prime
  example of how to build a package that uses Rcpp to connect to another third-party
  library. The autoconf script, inline plugin and example package can all be used
  as a stanza to write a similar package against another library.
