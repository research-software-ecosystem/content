Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Spatial distribution of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) along with tumor gene mutation status are of vital importance to the guidance of cancer immunotherapy and prognoses. In this work, we developed a deep learning-based computational framework, termed ImmunoAIzer, which involves: (1) the implementation of a semi\u2010supervised strategy to train a cellular biomarker distribution prediction network (CBDPN) to make predictions of spatial distributions of CD3, CD20, PanCK, and DAPI biomarkers in the tumor microenvironment with an accuracy of 90.4%; (2) using CBDPN to select tumor areas on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining tissue slides and training a multilabel tumor gene mutation detection network (TGMDN), which can detect APC, KRAS, and TP53 mutations with area\u2010under-the\u2010curve (AUC) values of 0.76, 0.77, and 0.79. These findings suggest that ImmunoAIzer could provide comprehensive information of cell distribution and tumor gene mutation status of colon cancer patients efficiently and less costly; hence, it could serve as an effective auxiliary tool for the guidance of immunotherapy and prognoses. The method is also generalizable and has the potential to be extended for application to other types of cancers other than colon cancer.",
