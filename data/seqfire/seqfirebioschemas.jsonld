  "sc:description": "Web tool for extracting regions of interest from a mulitple sequence alignment. From a multiple sequence alignment, it can search for and extract regions that contain insertions and deletions (indels), and output details of the indels, as well as a binary character matrix of conserved clean indels for use in phylogenetic analysis. It can also extract blocks of conserved columns from a sequence alignment, output for phylogenetic analysis.",
