By binding to the macromolecules or being mobile in the solvent, they maintain the integrity of the structure of macromolecules; participate in their enzymatic activity; or screen electrostatic interactions. While experimental methods are not always able to assign the exact location of ions, computational methods are in demand. Although the majority of computational methods are successful in predicting the position of ions buried inside macromolecules, they are less effective in deciphering positions of surface bound ions. Here, we propose the new BION algorithm (http://compbio.clemson.edu/bion-server-ph/) that predicts the location of the surface bound ions. It is more efficient and accurate compared to the previous version since it uses more advanced clustering algorithm in combination with pairing rules. In addition, the BION webserver allows specifying the pH and the salt concentration in predicting ions positions.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Petukh M."}, {"name": "Zhang M."}, {"name": "Alexov E."}], "date": "2015-12-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Computational Chemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Emil Alexov", "url": "http://compbio.clemson.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "tkimmet@clemson.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:bion", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://compbio.clemson.edu/bion_server_ph/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This web server addresses the demand for tools of predicting surface bound ions, for which specific interactions are not crucial; thus, they are difficult to predict.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/bion-predicting-non-specifically-bound-surface-ions.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "bion", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:36:59Z", "name": "BION", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://compbio.clemson.edu/bion_server_ph/assets/tutorial.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
