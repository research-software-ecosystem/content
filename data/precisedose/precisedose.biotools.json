    "description": "The PreciseDose system represents the first integrated computational environment combining classical pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic modeling with quantum-biological digital twin simulation.\nIt enables organ-level prediction of drug absorption and distribution through AI-assisted algorithms and real-time numerical solvers.\nThe system has been validated using external pharmacokinetic datasets and benchmarked against established models (Teoreler data).\nOutputs include physiologically accurate dose simulations and interactive 3D distribution maps.\nThis record introduces a novel multidisciplinary advancement in precision pharmacology and computational medicine.",
