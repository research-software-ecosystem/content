These include an automatic choice of all parameters, scaling by Patterson origin peaks and soft resolution cut-off. One of the cornerstones of the program is an original full-symmetry translation function combined with a packing function. Information from the model already placed in the cell is incorporated in both translation and packing functions. A number of tests using experimental data proved the ability of the program to find the correct solution in difficult cases.",
