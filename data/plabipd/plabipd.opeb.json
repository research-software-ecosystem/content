The reactions can then be tethered by the principle of inputs and outputs of one or more reaction to create pathways. This chapter provides a list of various online databases that carry information about plant pathways and provides a brief overview of how to use the pathway databases such as WikiPathways Plants Portal, MapMan and the cereal crop pathway databases like RiceCyc and MaizeCyc, that were developed using the Pathway Tools software.","authors":["Jaiswal P.","Usadel B."],"cit_count":7,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-3167-5_4","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","title":"Plant pathway databases","type":"Primary","year":"2016-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:plabipd","biotoolsID":"plabipd","description":"PlabiPD currently hosts data functional annotation of plant genomes using the MapMan Annotation, it also offers a webservice \"Mercator\" to automatically annotate and classify plant FASTA sequence in bulk submission.
