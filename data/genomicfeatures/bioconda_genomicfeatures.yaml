biotools_id: genomicfeatures
description: A set of tools and methods for making and manipulating transcript centric
  annotations. With these tools the user can easily download the genomic locations
  of the transcripts, exons and cds of a given organism, from either the UCSC Genome
  Browser or a BioMart database (more sources will be supported in the future). This
  information is then stored in a local database that keeps track of the relationship
  between transcripts, exons, cds and genes. Flexible methods are provided for extracting
  the desired features in a convenient format.
