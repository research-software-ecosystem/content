    "description": "Using mass spectrometry as a chemical reaction detector.\n\nAbstract Chemical reactions among small molecules enable untargeted metabolomics analysis, in which small molecules within tissue samples are identified through high-throughput assays. In standard mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, first significant small molecules are identified, then their biochemical relationships are probed to reveal biological fate (environmental studies) or biological impact (physiological response). However, we propose that biochemical relationships could be directly retrieved through untargeted high-resolution paired mass distance (PMD), which investigates chemical pairs in the samples without a priori knowledge of the identities of those participating compounds.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PMD'",
