Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Nowadays, knowledge extraction methods from Next Generation Sequencing data are highly requested. In this work, we focus on RNA-seq gene expression analysis and specifically on case-control studies with rule-based supervised classification algorithms that build a model able to discriminate cases from controls. State of the art algorithms compute a single classification model that contains few features (genes). On the contrary, our goal is to elicit a higher amount of knowledge by computing many classification models, and therefore to identify most of the genes related to the predicted class. Results: We propose CAMUR, a new method that extracts multiple and equivalent classification models. CAMUR iteratively computes a rule-based classification model, calculates the power set of the genes present in the rules, iteratively eliminates those combinations from the data set, and performs again the classification procedure until a stopping criterion is verified. CAMUR includes an ad-hoc knowledge repository (database) and a querying tool. We analyze three different types of RNA-seq data sets (Breast, Head and Neck, and Stomach Cancer) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and we validate CAMUR and its models also on non-TCGA data. Our experimental results show the efficacy of CAMUR: we obtain several reliable equivalent classification models, from which the most frequent genes, their relationships, and the relation with a particular cancer are deduced.", "citationCount": 17, "authors": [{"name": "Cestarelli V."}, {"name": "Fiscon G."}, {"name": "Felici G."}, {"name": "Bertolazzi P."}, {"name": "Weitschek E."}], "date": "2016-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Paola Bertolazzi", "url": "http://dmb.iasi.cnr.it/about_us.php", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "paola.bertolazzi@iasi.cnr.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:camur", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://dmb.iasi.cnr.it/camur.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2990"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "New method and software package able to extract multiple, alternative, and equivalent classification models.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/camur-classifier-with-alternative-and-multiple-rule-based-models.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "camur", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:38:03Z", "name": "CAMUR", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://dmb.iasi.cnr.it/Downloads/CAMUR/Camur_User_Guide.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
