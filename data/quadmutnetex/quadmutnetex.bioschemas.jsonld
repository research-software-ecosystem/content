      "sc:description": "a method for detecting cancer driver genes with low mutation frequency.\n\nCancer is caused by genetic mutations, but not all somatic mutations in human DNA drive the emergence or growth of cancers. While many frequently-mutated cancer driver genes have already been identified and are being utilized for diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic purposes, identifying driver genes that harbor mutations occurring with low frequency in human cancers is an ongoing endeavor. Typically, mutations that do not confer growth advantage to tumors - passenger mutations - dominate the mutation landscape of tumor cell genome, making identification of low-frequency driver mutations a challenge. The leading approach for discovering new putative driver genes involves analyzing patterns of mutations in large cohorts of patients and using statistical methods to discriminate driver from passenger mutations",
