        "description": "Phylogenetic reconstruction based on synteny block and gene adjacencies.\n\nAbstract Gene order can be used as an informative character to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships-between species independently from the local information present in gene protein sequences. PhyChro is a reconstruction method based on chromosomal rearrangements, applicable to a wide range of eukaryotic genomes with different gene contents and levels of synteny conservation. For each synteny breakpoint issued from pairwise genome comparisons, the algorithm defines two disjoint sets of genomes, named partial splits, respectively supporting the two block adjacencies defining the breakpoint. Considering all partial splits issued from all pairwise comparisons, a distance between two genomes is computed from the number of partial splits separating them. Tree reconstruction is achieved through a bottom-up approach by iteratively grouping sister genomes minimizing genome distances.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
