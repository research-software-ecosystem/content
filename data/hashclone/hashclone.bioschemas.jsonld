  "sc:description": "it is an easy-to-use and reliable bioinformatics tool that provides B-cells clonality assessment and MRD monitoring over time analyzing data from Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique. The HashClone strategy-based is composed of three steps: the first and second steps implement an alignment-free prediction method that identifies a set of putative clones belonging to the repertoire of the patient under study. In the third step the IGH variable region, diversity region, and joining region identification is obtained by the alignment of rearrangements with respect to the international ImMunoGenetics information system database.",
