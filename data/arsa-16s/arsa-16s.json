    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A New and Conceptually Different Approach for 16S-based Taxonomic Profiling | Here we describe ARSA-16S, a tool and accompanying reference database for the analysis of bacterial 16S amplicons. Among other features, ARSA-16S is based on a new model, approach, and algorithm for sequence-level assignment of reads understood as probability distributions, assigns reads individually, and is designed with non-overlapping amplicons covering two non-contiguous regions. A new set of primers for the amplification and sequencing of the V4 and V6 regions is also provided",
