Among other features, ARSA-16S is based on a new model, approach, and algorithm for sequence-level assignment of reads understood as probability distributions, assigns reads individually, and is designed with non-overlapping amplicons covering two non-contiguous regions. A new set of primers for the amplification and sequencing of the V4 and V6 regions is also provided","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.20944/PREPRINTS201909.0170.V1","name":"ARSA-16S"}}
