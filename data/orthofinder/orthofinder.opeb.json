Identifying homology relationships between sequences is fundamental to biological research. Here we provide a novel orthogroup inference algorithm called OrthoFinder that solves a previously undetected gene length bias in orthogroup inference, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy. Using real benchmark datasets we demonstrate that OrthoFinder is more accurate than other orthogroup inference methods by between 8 % and 33 %. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of OrthoFinder by providing a complete classification of transcription factor gene families in plants revealing 6.9 million previously unobserved relationships.","authors":["Emms D.M.","Kelly S."],"cit_count":356,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-015-0721-2","journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"26243257","title":"OrthoFinder: solving fundamental biases in whole genome comparisons dramatically improves orthogroup inference accuracy","type":"Primary","year":"2015-08-06"},{"doi":"10.1101/466201","type":"Primary","version":"2.0"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:OrthoFinder","biotoolsID":"OrthoFinder","description":"OrthoFinder is a fast, accurate and comprehensive platform for comparative genomics. It finds orthogroups and orthologs, infers rooted gene trees for all orthogroups and identifies all of the gene duplcation events in those gene trees. It also infers a rooted species tree for the species being analysed and maps the gene duplication events from the gene trees to branches in the species tree. OrthoFinder also provides comprehensive statistics for comparative genomic analyses.","homepage":"https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder","name":"OrthoFinder","version":["2.0"]}}
