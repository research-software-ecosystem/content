Traditionally, only one MS/MS spectrum is used for the sequencing of a peptide; however, the use of multiple spectra of the same peptide with different types of fragmentation has the potential to significantly increase the accuracy and practicality of de novo sequencing. Research into the use of multiple spectra is in a nascent stage. We propose a general framework to combine the two different types of MS/MS data. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the de novo sequencing of existing software. © 2010 Imperial College Press.","authors":["He L.","Ma B."],"cit_count":25,"journal":"Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","pmid":"21121022","title":"Adepts: Advanced peptide de novo sequencing with a pair of tandem mass spectra","year":"2010-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:adepts","biotoolsID":"adepts","description":"Software package for peptide identification using two different types of MS/MS spectra.","homepage":"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~l22he/","name":"ADEPTS"}}
