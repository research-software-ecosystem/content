Single nucleotide polymorphisms within the prion protein gene have been linked to differential susceptibility to the disease in many species. Wildlife managers are seeking to determine the frequencies of disease-associated alleles and genotypes and delineate spatial genetic patterns. The CWDPRNP package, implemented in program R, provides a unified framework for analyzing prion protein gene variability and spatial structure.","authors":["Miller W.L.","Walter W.D."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx333","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"CWDPRNP: A tool for cervid prion sequence analysis in program R","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cwdprnp","biotoolsID":"cwdprnp","description":"Unified framework for analyzing prion protein gene variability and spatial structure.","homepage":"https://ecosystems.psu.edu/research/labs/walter-lab/additional-labs/population-genetics-lab","name":"CWDPRNP"}}
