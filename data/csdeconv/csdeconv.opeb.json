CSDeconv differs from prior methods in that it uses a blind deconvolution approach that allows closely-spaced binding sites to be called accurately. We apply CSDeconv to novel ChIP-seq data for DosR binding in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and to existing data for GABP in humans and show that it can discriminate binding sites separated by as few as 40 bp. © 2009 Lun et al.; licensee Biomed Central Ltd.","authors":["Lun D.S.","Sherrid A.","Weiner B.","Sherman D.R.","Galagan J.E."],"cit_count":48,"doi":"10.1186/gb-2009-10-12-r142","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"A blind deconvolution approach to high-resolution mapping of transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data","type":"Primary","year":"2009-12-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:csdeconv","biotoolsID":"csdeconv","description":"CSDeconv maps transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data to high resolution using a blind deconvolution approach","homepage":"http://crab.rutgers.edu/~dslun/csdeconv/index.html","name":"CSDeconv","version":["1.03"]}}
