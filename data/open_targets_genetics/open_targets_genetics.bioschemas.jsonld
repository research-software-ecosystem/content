      "sc:description": "Open Targets Genetics is a robust tool highlighting variant-centric statistical evidence to allow both prioritisation of candidate causal variants at trait-associated loci and identification of potential drug targets.\n\nThe portal aggregates and merges genetic associations curated from both literature and newly-derived loci from UK Biobank, which contains functional genomics data (e.g. chromatin conformation, chromatin interactions) and quantitative trait loci (eQTLs and pQTLs). Statistical fine-mapping methods are applied across thousands of trait-associated loci to resolve association signals and to link each variant to its proximal and distal target gene(s), using a single evidence score. Integrated cross-trait colocalisation analyses and linking to detailed pharmaceutical compounds extend the capability of Open Targets Genetics to explore drug repositioning opportunities and shared genetic architecture.",
