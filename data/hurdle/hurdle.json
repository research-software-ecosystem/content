    "description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | GRAPHICAL MODELS FOR ZERO-INFLATED SINGLE CELL GENE EXPRESSION | Estimation and sampling for multi-dimensional Hurdle models on a Normal density with applications to single-cell co-expression | A Hurdle model is a modification of a distribution at zero. This package provides routines to estimate and sample from multivariate Hurdle models on a Normal density. These are distributions that are conditionally Normal, but with singularities along the coordinate axes, so generalize a univariate zero-inflated distribution",
