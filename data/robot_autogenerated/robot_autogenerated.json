    "description": "A Robot's Response Acceleration Using the Metric Dimension Problem.\n\nConsider a robot that is navigating in a space modeled by a graph, and that wants to know its current location. It can send a signal to determine how far it is from each landmark among a set of fixed landmarks. We study the problem of computing the minimum required number of landmarks, and where they should be placed so that the robot can always determine its location. Since the problem is an NP-complete problem, the robot's responses to the actions are slow. To accelerate this response, we can use the parallel version of this problem. In this work, we introduce a new parallel implementation for determining the metric dimension of a given graph.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME (robot) SIMILAR TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/ROBOT (ROBOT).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'metric', 'landmarks', 'SMP', 'NP-complete'",
