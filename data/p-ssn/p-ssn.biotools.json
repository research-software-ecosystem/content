For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.A single-sample network (SSN) is a biological molecular network constructed from single-sample data given a reference dataset and can provide insights into the mechanisms of individual diseases and aid in the development of personalized medicine. In this study, we proposed a computational method, a partial correlation-based single-sample network (P-SSN), which not only infers a network from each single-sample data given a reference dataset but also retains the direct interactions by excluding indirect interactions (https://github.com/hyhRise/P-SSN). By applying P-SSN to analyze tumor data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and single cell data, we validated the effectiveness of P-SSN in predicting driver mutation genes (DMGs), producing network distance, identifying subtypes and further classifying single cells. In particular, P-SSN is highly effective in predicting DMGs based on single-sample data. P-SSN is also efficient for subtyping complex diseases and for clustering single cells by introducing network distance between any two samples.",
