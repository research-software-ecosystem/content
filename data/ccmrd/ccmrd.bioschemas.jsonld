      "sc:description": "Complex Carbohydrate Magnetic Resonance Database (CCMRD) is a solid-state NMR database for complex carbohydrates. Carbohydrates play key roles in many life activities in living organisms. As an emerging technique with steadily improving resolution, solid-state NMR spectroscopy has the unique capability in revealing the molecular structure and dynamics of insoluble complex carbohydrates. We developed and implemented CCMRD, Complex Carbohydrates Magnetic Resonance Database, a solid-state NMR database for complex carbohydrates. Currently, it holds more than 400 solid-state NMR spectra and expects rapid expansion. The database supports searching by atom, chemical shifts and residue names.",
