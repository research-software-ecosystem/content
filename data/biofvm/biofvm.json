Results: We introduce BioFVM, a diffusive transport solver tailored to biological problems. BioFVM can simulate release and uptake of many substrates by cell and bulk sources, diffusion and decay in large 3D domains. It has been parallelized with OpenMP, allowing efficient simulations on desktop workstations or single supercomputer nodes. The code is stable even for large time steps, with linear computational cost scalings. Solutions are first-order accurate in time and second-order accurate in space. The code can be run by itself or as part of a larger simulator.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Ghaffarizadeh A."}, {"name": "Friedman S.H."}, {"name": "MacKlin P."}], "date": "2016-04-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Paul Macklin, Ph.D", "url": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/biofvm/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "macklinp@iu.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:biofvm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://biofvm.mathcancer.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular dynamics simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Open source diffusive transport solver for biological problems.
