  "sc:description": "Designed to solve a problem in DNA genotyping. It helps in the construction of allelic ladders that drive the sizing and binning of SSR fragments produced by PCR. The algorithm scans a spreadsheet containing a database of individual profiles and finds a minimum set of individuals, that covers the maximum number of alleles represented in the database, with all alleles represented only once.",
