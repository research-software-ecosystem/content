                "abstract": "The fortran program ESPript was created in 1993, to display on a PostScript figure multiple sequence alignments adorned with secondary structure elements. A web server was made available in 1999 and ESPript has been linked to three major web tools: ProDom which identifies protein domains, PredictProtein which predicts secondary structure elements and NPSwhich runs sequence alignment programs. A web server named ENDscript was created in 2002 to facilitate the generation of ESPript figures containing a large amount of information. ENDscript uses programs such as BLAST, Clustal and PHYLODENDRON to work on protein sequences and such as DSSP, CNS and MOLSCRIPT to work on protein coordinates. It enables the creation, from a single Protein Data Bank identifier, of a multiple sequence alignment figure adorned with secondary structure elements of each sequence of known 3D structure. Similar 3D structures are super-imposed in turn with the program PROFIT and a final figure is drawn with BOBSCRIPT, which shows sequence and structure conservation along the C\u03b1 trace of the query. ESPript and ENDscript are available at http://genopole.toulouse.inra.fr/ESPript.",

It uses as query the co-ordinates file of a protein in Protein Data Bank format and generates PostScript and png figures showing: residues conserved after a multiple alignment against homologous sequences, secondary structure elements, accessibility, hydropathy and intermolecular contacts. Thus, the user can relate quickly 1D, 2D and 3D information of a protein of known structure.",
