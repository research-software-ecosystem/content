                "abstract": "Identification of novel protein binding sites expands druggable genome and opens new opportunities for drug discovery. Generally, presence or absence of a binding site depends on the three-dimensional conformation of a protein, making binding site identification resemble the object detection problem in computer vision. Here we introduce a computational approach for the large-scale detection of protein binding sites, that considers protein conformations as 3D-images, binding sites as objects on these images to detect, and conformational ensembles of proteins as 3D-videos to analyze. BiteNet is suitable for spatiotemporal detection of hard-to-spot allosteric binding sites, as we showed for conformation-specific binding site of the epidermal growth factor receptor, oligomer-specific binding site of the ion channel, and binding site in G protein-coupled receptor. BiteNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods both in terms of accuracy and speed, taking about 1.5 minutes to analyze 1000 conformations of a protein with ~2000 atoms.",
