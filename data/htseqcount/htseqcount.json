Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: A large choice of tools exists for many standard tasks in the analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. However, once a project deviates from standard workflows, custom scripts are needed. Results: We present HTSeq, a Python library to facilitate the rapid development of such scripts. HTSeq offers parsers for many common data formats in HTS projects, as well as classes to represent data, such as genomic coordinates, sequences, sequencing reads, alignments, gene model information and variant calls, and provides data structures that allow for querying via genomic coordinates. We also present htseq-count, a tool developed with HTSeq that preprocesses RNA-Seq data for differential expression analysis by counting the overlap of reads with genes.", "citationCount": 3548, "authors": [{"name": "Anders S."}, {"name": "Pyl P.T."}, {"name": "Huber W."}], "date": "2015-01-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/nar/gkw343", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update", "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.", "citationCount": 523, "authors": [{"name": "Afgan E."}, {"name": "Baker D."}, {"name": "van den Beek M."}, {"name": "Blankenberg D."}, {"name": "Bouvier D."}, {"name": "Cech M."}, {"name": "Chilton J."}, {"name": "Clements D."}, {"name": "Coraor N."}, {"name": "Eberhard C."}, {"name": "Gruning B."}, {"name": "Guerler A."}, {"name": "Hillman-Jackson J."}, {"name": "Von Kuster G."}, {"name": "Rasche E."}, {"name": "Soranzo N."}, {"name": "Turaga N."}, {"name": "Taylor J."}, {"name": "Nekrutenko A."}, {"name": "Goecks J."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}, {"doi": "10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": null}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Galaxy Support Team", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "galaxy@pasteur.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:htseqcount-ip", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["0.6.1p1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}, {"term": "SAM", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2573"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "GFF", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2305"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence composition calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0236"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Sequence trace", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0924"}, "format": [{"term": "SAM", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2573"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-20T08:24:17Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This script takes an alignment file in SAM format and a feature file in GFF format and calculates for each feature the number of reads mapping to it.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/tool_runner?tool_id=toolshed.pasteur.fr/repos/fmareuil/htseqcount/htseqCount/0.6.1p1", "note": null, "type": "Galaxy service"}], "biotoolsID": "htseqcount", "additionDate": "2016-12-19T14:22:55Z", "name": "htseqcount", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.9.1/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
