    "description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'NEEDS study' | a protocol for a cross-sectional smartphone tracking study and a longitudinal population register study | Dynamic Urban Environmental Exposures on Depression and Suicide | Depression is among the leading health burdens worldwide and people affected by depression have a higher suicide risk.
