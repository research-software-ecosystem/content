  "sc:description": "The Gene Ontology Consortium continues to develop, maintain and use a set of structured, controlled vocabularies for the annotation of genes, gene products and sequences. Several new relationship types have been introduced and used, along with existing relationships, to create links between and within the domains. Gene product annotation continues to increase both in the number of total annotations and in species coverage. Tools have seen major improvements in functionality, speed and usage.",
