    "description": "A proposed methodology and inventory of effective tools to link chemicals to adverse outcome pathways | Welcome to the Adverse Outcome Pathway Exploratory Research Assistant (AOPERA)! | AOPERA is designed to identify existing tools that can assist you in the process of linking your chemical to an adverse outcome pathway (AOP). This informational tool is specifically targeted to users with an uncharacterized chemical and limited toxicity information, but can also assist you if you already have information that links your uncharacterized chemical to a molecular initiating event (MIE), a key event (KE), or an adverse outcome (AO), or if you have a characterized chemical",
