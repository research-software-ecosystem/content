  description: Interactive Visual Analytics Tool for Genome Assemblies
  long_description: " Genome assembly remains an inexact science. Even when accomplished\n\
    \ with the best software available, the assembly of a genome often\n contains\
    \ numerous errors, both small and large. Hawkeye is a visual\n analytics tool\
    \ for genome assembly analysis and validation, designed\n to aid in identifying\
    \ and correcting assembly errors. Hawkeye blends\n the best practices from information\
    \ and scientific visualization to\n facilitate inspection of large-scale assembly\
    \ data while minimizing\n the time needed to detect mis-assemblies and make accurate\
    \ judgments\n of assembly quality.\n .\n All levels of the assembly data hierarchy\
    \ are made accessible to\n users, along with summary statistics and common assembly\
    \ metrics. A\n ranking component guides investigation towards likely mis-assemblies\n\
    \ or interesting features to support the task at hand. Wherever\n possible, high-level\
    \ overviews, dynamic filtering, and automated\n clustering are leveraged to focus\
    \ attention and highlight anomalies\n in the data. Hawkeyes effectiveness has\
    \ been proven on several genome\n projects, where it has been used both to improve\
    \ quality and to\n validate the correctness of complex genomes.\n .\n Hawkeye\
    \ is compatible with most widely used assemblers, including\n Phrap, ARACHNE,\
    \ Celera Assembler, Newbler, AMOS, and assemblies\n deposited in the NCBI Assembly\
    \ Archive."
