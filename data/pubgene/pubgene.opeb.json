The associations between genes have been annotated by linking genes to terms from the medical subject heading (MeSH) index and terms from the gene ontology (GO) database. The extracted database and accompanying web tools for gene-expression analysis have collectively been named 'PubGene'. We validated the extracted networks by three large-scale experiments showing that co-occurrence reflects biologically meaningful relationships, thus providing an approach to extract and structure known biology. We validated the applicability of the tools by analyzing two publicly available microarray data sets.","authors":["Jenssen T.-K.","Laegreid A.","Komorowski J.","Hovig E."],"cit_count":603,"journal":"Nature Genetics","pmid":"11326270","title":"A literature network of human genes for high-throughput analysis of gene expression","year":"2001-05-16"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pubgene","biotoolsID":"pubgene","description":"Searchable literature network of human genes with tools for gene expression analysis.
