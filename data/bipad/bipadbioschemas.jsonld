  "sc:description": "A web interface to predict sequence elements embedded within unaligned sequences. Either a bipartite model, consisting of a pair of one-block position weight matrices with a gap distribution, or a single PWM matrix for contiguous single block motifs may be produced. It performs multiple local alignment by entropy minimization and cyclic refinement using a stochastic greedy search strategy.",
