summary: Bayesian Inference of Alignment and Phylogeny
description: >
   BAli-Phy estimates multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees
   from unaligned DNA, amino acid, or codon sequences.  BAli-Phy uses MCMC
   to estimate evolutionary trees, positive selection, and branch lengths
   while averaging over alternative alignments. BAli-Phy can display
   alignment ambiguity graphically in an alignment uncertainty (AU) plot.
   .
   BAli-Phy can also estimate phylogenies from a fixed alignment (like MrBayes
   and BEAST) using substitution models like GTR+gamma.  BAli-Phy automatically
   estimates relative rates for each gene.
