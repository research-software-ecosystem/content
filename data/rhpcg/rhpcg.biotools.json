    "description": "a database of the Regulation of the Hippo Pathway in Cancer Genome.\n\nHippo signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway, which is consisted of a group of kinases. Dysregulation of Hippo signaling pathway is involved in the initiation and progression of cancer, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and so on. RHPCG serves as a valuable resource for understanding the roles of Hippo signaling pathway in carcinogenesis. The features of RHPCG contain: (i) the landscape of Hippo gene alterations at multiple omics level; (ii) quick search Hippo regulatory motifs by mRNA, lncRNA, circRNA or miRNA; and (iii) all the Hippo related motifs can be visualized as network and be downloaded freely",

Published by Oxford University Press.The Hippo signaling pathway is a highly conserved pathway controlling organ size, cell proliferation, apoptosis and other biological functions. Recent studies have shown that Hippo signaling pathway also plays important roles in cancer initiation and progression. However, a database offering multi-omics analyses and visualization of Hippo pathway genes in cancer, as well as comprehensive Hippo regulatory relationships is still lacking. To fill this gap, we constructed the Regulation of the Hippo Pathway in Cancer Genome (RHPCG) database. Currently, RHPCG focuses on analyzing the 21 core Hippo-protein-encoding genes in over 10 000 patients across 33 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cancer types at the levels of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape. Concurrently, RHPCG provides in its motif section 11 regulatory motif types associated with 21 core Hippo pathway genes containing 180 miRNAs, 6182 lncRNAs, 728 circRNAs and 335 protein coding genes. Thus, RHPCG is a powerful tool that could help researchers understand gene alterations and regulatory mechanisms in the Hippo signaling pathway in cancer.",
