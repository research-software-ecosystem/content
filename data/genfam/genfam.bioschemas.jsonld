      "sc:description": "A web application and database for gene family-based classification and functional enrichment analysis.\n\nGenome-scale studies using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies generate substantial lists of differentially expressed genes under different experimental conditions. These gene lists need to be further mined to narrow down biologically relevant genes and associated functions in order to guide downstream functional genetic analyses. A popular approach is to determine statistically overrepresented genes in a user-defined list through enrichment analysis tools, which rely on functional annotations of genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Here, we propose a new computational approach, GenFam, which allows annotation, classification, and enrichment of genes based on their gene family, thus simplifying identification of candidate gene families and associated genes that may be relevant to the query.",
