Publicly available implementations tend to be slow, impeding large scale analyses such as the genome-wide computation of pairwise gene knock-outs, or the automated search for model improvements. Furthermore, available implementations cannot easily be extended or adapted by users.Results: Here, we present sybil, an open source software library for constraint-based analyses in R; R is a free, platform-independent environment for statistical computing and graphics that is widely used in bioinformatics. Among other functions, sybil currently provides efficient methods for flux-balance analysis (FBA), MOMA, and ROOM that are about ten times faster than previous implementations when calculating the effect of whole-genome single gene deletions in silico on a complete E. coli metabolic model.Conclusions: Due to the object-oriented architecture of sybil, users can easily build analysis pipelines in R or even implement their own constraint-based algorithms. Based on its highly efficient communication with different mathematical optimisation programs, sybil facilitates the exploration of high-dimensional optimisation problems on small time scales. Sybil and all its dependencies are open source. Sybil and its documentation are available for download from the comprehensive R archive network (CRAN). \u00a9 2013 Gelius-Dietrich et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 40, "authors": [{"name": "Gelius-Dietrich G."}, {"name": "Desouki A.A."}, {"name": "Fritzemeier C.J."}, {"name": "Lercher M.J."}], "date": "2013-11-13T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mayo Roettger", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mayo.roettger@hhu.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sybil-metabolic", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sybil/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Service invocation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3763"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Implements algorithms for constraint based analyses of metabolic networks, e.g. flux-balance analysis (FBA), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), regulatory on/off minimization (ROOM), robustness analysis and flux variability analysis.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "sybil-metabolic", "additionDate": "2018-08-17T18:41:42Z", "name": "sybil", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sybil/sybil.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
