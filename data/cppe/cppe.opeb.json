The library is implemented in C++, and it additionally provides a Python interface for rapid prototyping and experimentation in a high-level scripting language. Our library integrates seamlessly with existing quantum chemical program packages through an intuitive and minimal interface. Until now, CPPE has been interfaced to three packages, Q-Chem, Psi4, and PySCF. Furthermore, we show CPPE in action using all three program packages for a computational spectroscopy application. With CPPE, host program interfaces only require minor programming effort, paving the way for new combined methodologies and broader availability of the PE model.","authors":["Scheurer M.","Reinholdt P.","Kjellgren E.R.","Haugaard Olsen J.M.","Dreuw A.","Kongsted J."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JCTC.9B00758","journal":"Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation","pmid":"31580670","title":"CPPE: An Open-Source C++ and Python Library for Polarizable Embedding","year":"2019-11-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:CPPE","biotoolsID":"CPPE","description":"An Open-Source C++ and Python Library for Polarizable Embedding.\n\nC++ and Python library for Polarizable Embedding.\n\nCPPE is an open-source, light-weight C-Plus-Plus library for Polarizable Embedding (PE)1,2 calculations.
