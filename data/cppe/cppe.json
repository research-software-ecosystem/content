The library is implemented in C++, and it additionally provides a Python interface for rapid prototyping and experimentation in a high-level scripting language. Our library integrates seamlessly with existing quantum chemical program packages through an intuitive and minimal interface. Until now, CPPE has been interfaced to three packages, Q-Chem, Psi4, and PySCF. Furthermore, we show CPPE in action using all three program packages for a computational spectroscopy application. With CPPE, host program interfaces only require minor programming effort, paving the way for new combined methodologies and broader availability of the PE model.",
