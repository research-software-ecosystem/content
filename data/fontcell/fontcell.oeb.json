        "description": "Fusion of Ontologies of Cells.\n\nAbstract High-throughput cell-data technologies such as single-cell RNA-Seq create a demand for algorithms for automatic cell classification and characterization. There exist several classification ontologies of cells with complementary information. However, one needs to merge them in order to combine synergistically their information. The main difficulty in merging is to match the ontologies since they use different naming conventions. To overcome this obstacle we developed an algorithm that merges ontologies by integrating the name-matching search between class label names with the structure mapping between the ontology elements. To implement our algorithms, we developed FOntCell, a software module in Python for efficient automatic parallel-computed fusion of ontologies in the same or similar knowledge domains. It processes the ontology attributes to extract relations and class synonyms.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
