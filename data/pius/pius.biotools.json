    "description": "Open source tool that performs peptide identification from tandem mass spectrograms using the six-frame translation of the complete genome. Differently from peptidomics methods that also allow a search against the complete genome, it does not limit analysis of the genome to a small set of sequences that match a list of de novo reconstructions. Instead, it performs an exhaustive scan of the translation of the six reading frames of the complete genome.",

                "abstract": "We present PIUS, a tool that identifies peptides from tandem mass spectrometry data by analyzing the six-frame translation of a complete genome. It differs from earlier studies that have performed such a genomic search in two ways: (i) it considers a larger search space and (ii) it is designed for natural peptide identification rather than proteomics. Differently from other peptidomics tools designed for genome-wide searches, PIUS does not limit the analysis to a set of sequences that match a list of de novo reconstructions.
