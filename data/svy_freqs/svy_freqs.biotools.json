    "description": "A generic SAS macro for cross-tabulation between a factor and a by-group variable given a third variable and creating publication-quality tables using data from complex surveys | Abstract Introduction In epidemiological studies, cross-tabulations are a simple but important tool for understanding the distribution of socio-demographic characteristics among study participants. They become more useful when comparisons are presented using a by-group variable such as key demographic characteristic or an outcome status; for instance, sex or the presence or absence of a disease status. Most available statistical analysis software can easily perform cross-tabulations, however, output from these must be processed further to make it readily available for review and use in a publication",
