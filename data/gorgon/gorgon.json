Typically, however, only non-atomic resolution reconstructions have been obtained for these large complexes, necessitating computational tools for integrating and extracting structural details. With recent advances in cryo-EM, maps at near-atomic resolutions have been achieved for several macromolecular assemblies from which models have been manually constructed. In this work, we describe a new interactive modeling toolkit called Gorgon targeted at intermediate to near-atomic resolution density maps (10-3.5. \u00c5), particularly from cryo-EM. Gorgon's de novo modeling procedure couples sequence-based secondary structure prediction with feature detection and geometric modeling techniques to generate initial protein backbone models. Beyond model building, Gorgon is an extensible interactive visualization platform with a variety of computational tools for annotating a wide variety of 3D volumes. Examples from cryo-EM maps of Rotavirus and Rice Dwarf Virus are used to demonstrate its applicability to modeling protein structure. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Inc.", "citationCount": 57, "authors": [{"name": "Baker M.L."}, {"name": "Abeysinghe S.S."}, {"name": "Schuh S."}, {"name": "Coleman R.A."}, {"name": "Abrams A."}, {"name": "Marsh M.P."}, {"name": "Hryc C.F."}, {"name": "Ruths T."}, {"name": "Chiu W."}, {"name": "Ju T."}], "date": "2011-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Structural Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://www.facebook.com/MediaAndMachines", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gorgon", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://gorgon.wustl.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0477"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Interactive molecular modeling system specifically geared towards cryo-EM and other low resolution structures of macromolecular complexes.
