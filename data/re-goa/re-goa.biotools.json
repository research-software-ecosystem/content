                "abstract": "Motivation: Regulatory elements (REs), such as enhancers and promoters, are known as regulatory sequences functional in a heterogeneous regulatory network to control gene expression by recruiting transcription regulators and carrying genetic variants in a context specific way. Annotating those REs relies on costly and labor-intensive next-generation sequencing and RNA-guided editing technologies in many cellular contexts. Results: We propose a systematic Gene Ontology Annotation method for Regulatory Elements (RE-GOA) by leveraging the powerful word embedding in natural language processing. We first assemble a heterogeneous network by integrating context specific regulations, protein-protein interactions and gene ontology (GO) terms. Then we perform network embedding and associate regulatory elements with GO terms by assessing their similarity in a low dimensional vector space. With three applications, we show that RE-GOA outperforms existing methods in annotating TFs' binding sites from ChIP-seq data, in functional enrichment analysis of differentially accessible peaks from ATAC-seq data, and in revealing genetic correlation among phenotypes from their GWAS summary statistics data.",
