Tools for analysis of these data are at clue.io | The earlier Affymetrix-microarray based Connectivity Map data (build02) is available in archive mode on this page (see below) | The Connectivity Map (also known as cmap) is a collection of genome-wide transcriptional expression data from cultured human cells treated with bioactive small molecules and simple pattern-matching algorithms that together enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through the transitory feature of common gene-expression changes",
