description: A normalization method for single-cell UMI count data using a variance
  stabilizing transformation. The transformation is based on a negative binomial regression
  model with regularized parameters. As part of the same regression framework, this
  package also provides functions for batch correction, and data correction. See Hafemeister
  and Satija 2019 <doi:10.1101/576827> for more details.
