    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IQ-TREE' (bio.tools/iq-tree) | The Prevalence and Impact of Model Violations in Phylogenetic Analysis | tests of stationarity, reversibility, and homogeneity for sequence alignments | This just deletes (with rm -rf, so be careful), /data/srh/processed_data/SRH_tables/ and /data/srh/processed_data/IQtree/ | All scripts have hard-coded input and output destinations. If you want to run them for yourself, you will need to adjust these destinations in each script as you go | This will calculate SRH stats and IQtree input files for all datasets in SRHtests/datasets. It requires python 3.6.x or higher and dependencies as in the header of srh.py. Input and output files are hardcoded near the end of the script, change them if you need to. This script creates two output folders, each of which contains one folder for each dataset in SRHtests/datasets",
