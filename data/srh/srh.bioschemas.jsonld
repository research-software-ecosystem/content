If you want to run them for yourself, you will need to adjust these destinations in each script as you go | This will calculate SRH stats and IQtree input files for all datasets in SRHtests/datasets. It requires python 3.6.x or higher and dependencies as in the header of srh.py. Input and output files are hardcoded near the end of the script, change them if you need to. This script creates two output folders, each of which contains one folder for each dataset in SRHtests/datasets",
