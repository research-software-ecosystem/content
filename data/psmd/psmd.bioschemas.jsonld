PSMD was developed as a web-based comprehensive database comprising 678,106,741 perfect microsatellites and 43,848,943 compound microsatellites from 18,408 organisms covered almost all species with available genomic data. PSMD enables scientists to easily browse, filter, compare, download SSRs with relevant information",
