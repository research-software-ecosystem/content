Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. The wide variety of published approaches for the problemof regulatory network inferencemakes usingmultiple inference algorithms complex and time-consuming. Network Analysis and Inference Library (NAIL) is a set of software tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory network inference. It uses a modular approach to connect different network inference algorithms to the same visualization and network-based analyses. NAIL is technologyindependent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Hurley D.G."}, {"name": "Cursons J."}, {"name": "Wang Y.K."}, {"name": "Budden D.M."}, {"name": "Print C.G."}, {"name": "Crampin E.J."}], "date": "2015-01-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Daniel G.
