All rights reserved.The wide variety of published approaches for the problemof regulatory network inferencemakes usingmultiple inference algorithms complex and time-consuming. Network Analysis and Inference Library (NAIL) is a set of software tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory network inference. It uses a modular approach to connect different network inference algorithms to the same visualization and network-based analyses. NAIL is technologyindependent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications.",
