The wide variety of published approaches for the problemof regulatory network inferencemakes usingmultiple inference algorithms complex and time-consuming. Network Analysis and Inference Library (NAIL) is a set of software tools to simplify the range of computational activities involved in regulatory network inference. It uses a modular approach to connect different network inference algorithms to the same visualization and network-based analyses. NAIL is technologyindependent and includes an interface layer to allow easy integration of components into other applications.","authors":["Hurley D.G.","Cursons J.","Wang Y.K.","Budden D.M.","Print C.G.","Crampin E.J."],"cit_count":8,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25246431","title":"NAIL, a software toolset for inferring, analyzing and visualizing regulatory networks","year":"2015-01-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:nail","biotoolsID":"nail","description":"Set of tools for solving problems in the life sciences using network (graph) approaches.
