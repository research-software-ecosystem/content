However, the selection of the data to be analyzed through these games is under the exclusive control of the game designers, and so are the results produced by gamers. Here, we introduce Open-Phylo, a freely accessible crowd-computing platform that enables any scientist to enter our system and use crowds of gamers to assist computer programs in solving one of the most fundamental problems in genomics: the multiple sequence alignment problem. © 2013 Kwak et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Kwak D.","Kam A.","Becerra D.","Zhou Q.","Hops A.","Zarour E.","Kam A.","Sarmenta L.","Blanchette M.","Waldispuhl J."],"cit_count":11,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"24148814","title":"Open-Phylo: A customizable crowd-computing platform for multiple sequence alignment","year":"2013-10-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:phylo","biotoolsID":"phylo","description":"Human-based computing framework applying “crowd sourcing” techniques to solve the Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) problem.
