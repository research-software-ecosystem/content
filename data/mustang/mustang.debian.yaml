description: Mustang is an algorithm to align multiple protein structures. Given a
  set of PDB files, the program uses the spatial information in the Calpha atoms of
  the set to produce a sequence alignment. Based on a progressive pairwise heuristic
  the algorithm then proceeds through a number of refinement passes. Mustang reports
  the multiple sequence alignment and the corresponding superposition of structures.
