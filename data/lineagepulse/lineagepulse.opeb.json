LineagePulse accounts for batch effects, drop-out and variable sequencing depth. One can use LineagePulse to perform longitudinal differential expression analysis across pseudotime as a continuous coordinate or between discrete groups of cells. Expression model fits can be directly extracted from LineagePulse.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/LineagePulse.html","name":"LineagePulse","version":["1.0.0"]}}
