  "sc:description": "It is a differential expression and expression model fitting package tailored to single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq). LineagePulse accounts for batch effects, drop-out and variable sequencing depth. One can use LineagePulse to perform longitudinal differential expression analysis across pseudotime as a continuous coordinate or between discrete groups of cells. Expression model fits can be directly extracted from LineagePulse.",
