  "sc:description": "The PET Oncology Radiomics Test Suite is a set of functions for computing many standard image texture metrics for 3D image volumes. The functions are fast, and have been verified against the publications from which they are derived. Arbitrary ROIs can be used for texture metric computation, simply supply a 3D binary mask. Texture metrics include Histogram-based metrics, Gray Level Co-Occurance Matrix (Haralick), Neighborhood Graytone Difference Matrix, and Size Zone Matrix calculations.",
