  description: HMM-HDP models for MinION signal alignments
  long_description: " MinION signal-level alignment and methylation detection using\
    \ hidden\n Markov Models with hierarchical Dirichlet process kmer learning.\n\
    \ .\n Nanopore sequencing is based on the principal of isolating a nanopore in\n\
    \ a membrane separating buffered salt solutions, then applying a voltage\n across\
    \ the membrane and monitoring the ionic current through the\n nanopore. The Oxford\
    \ Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequences DNA by\n recording the ionic current\
    \ as DNA strands are enzymatically guided\n through the nanopore. SignalAlign\
    \ will align the ionic current from the\n MinION to a reference sequence using\
    \ a trainable hidden Markov model\n (HMM). The emissions model for the HMM can\
    \ either be the table of\n parametric normal distributions provided by ONT or\
    \ a hierarchical\n Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture of normal distributions. The\
    \ HDP models\n enable mapping of methylated bases to your reference sequence."
