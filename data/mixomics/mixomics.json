However, the development of such an analysis is a major computational and technical challenge as most approaches suffer from high data dimensionality. New methodologies need to be developed and validated. Results: integrOmics efficiently performs integrative analyses of two types of 'omics' variables that are measured on the same samples. It includes a regularized version of canonical correlation analysis to enlighten correlations between two datasets, and a sparse version of partial least squares (PLS) regression that includes simultaneous variable selection in both datasets. The usefulness of both approaches has been demonstrated previously and successfully applied in various integrative studies. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2009.

The advent of high throughput technologies has led to a wealth of publicly available \u2018omics data coming from different sources, such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics. Combining such large-scale biological data sets can lead to the discovery of important biological insights, provided that relevant information can be extracted in a holistic manner. Current statistical approaches have been focusing on identifying small subsets of molecules (a \u2018molecular signature\u2019) to explain or predict biological conditions, but mainly for a single type of \u2018omics. In addition, commonly used methods are univariate and consider each biological feature independently. We introduce mixOmics, an R package dedicated to the multivariate analysis of biological data sets with a specific focus on data exploration, dimension reduction and visualisation. By adopting a systems biology approach, the toolkit provides a wide range of methods that statistically integrate several data sets at once to probe relationships between heterogeneous \u2018omics data sets. Our recent methods extend Projection to Latent Structure (PLS) models for discriminant analysis, for data integration across multiple \u2018omics data or across independent studies, and for the identification of molecular signatures. We illustrate our latest mixOmics integrative frameworks for the multivariate analyses of \u2018omics data available from the package.", "citationCount": 77, "authors": [{"name": "Rohart F."}, {"name": "Gautier B."}, {"name": "Singh A."}, {"name": "Le Cao K.-A."}], "date": "2017-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "unimelb.edu.au", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Australia", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mixomics@math.univ-toulouse.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mixomics", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mixomics.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool offers a wide range of multivariate methods for the exploration and integration of biological datasets with a particular focus on variable selection.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["ELIXIR-EE"]}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "mixomics", "additionDate": "2016-10-02T22:18:58Z", "name": "mixomics", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://qfab.org/biostatistics/mixOmics", "note": null, "type": "General"}, {"url": "https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixOmics/mixOmics.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
