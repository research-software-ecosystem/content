  description: devel files for C++ atomic_queue library
  long_description: " C++11 multiple-producer-multiple-consumer lockless queues based\
    \ on\n circular buffer with std::atomic.  The main design principle these\n queues\
    \ follow is simplicity: the bare minimum of atomic operations,\n fixed size buffer,\
    \ value semantics.\n .\n The circular buffer side-steps the memory reclamation\
    \ problem inherent\n in linked-list based queues for the price of fixed buffer\
    \ size. See\n Effective memory reclamation for lock-free data structures in C++\n\
    \ for more details.\n .\n These qualities are also limitations:\n .\n  * The maximum\
    \ queue size must be set at compile time or construction time.\n  * There are\
    \ no OS-blocking push/pop functions.\n .\n Nevertheless, ultra-low-latency applications\
    \ need just that and nothing\n more. The simplicity pays off, see the throughput\
    \ and latency benchmarks.\n .\n Available containers are:\n .\n  * AtomicQueue\
    \ - a fixed size ring-buffer for atomic elements.\n  * OptimistAtomicQueue - a\
    \ faster fixed size ring-buffer for atomic\n    elements which busy-waits when\
    \ empty or full.\n  * AtomicQueue2 - a fixed size ring-buffer for non-atomic elements.\n\
    \  * OptimistAtomicQueue2 - a faster fixed size ring-buffer for non-atomic\n \
    \   elements which busy-waits when empty or full.\n .\n These containers have\
    \ corresponding AtomicQueueB, OptimistAtomicQueueB,\n AtomicQueueB2, OptimistAtomicQueueB2\
    \ versions where the buffer size is\n specified as an argument to the constructor."
