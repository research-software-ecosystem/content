We have recently reported a method called ubiquitin interactor affinity enrichment\u2013mass spectrometry (ubIa-Ms), which enables comprehensive identification of ubiquitin interactors for all ubiquitin linkages from crude cell lysates. one major strength of ubIa-Ms is the fact that ubiquitin interactors are enriched from crude cell lysates, in which proteins are present at endogenous levels, contain biologically relevant post-translational modifications (ptMs) and are assembled in native protein complexes. In addition, ubIa-Ms uses chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, which mimics native diubiquitin and is inert to cleavage by endogenous deubiquitinases (DuBs). Here, we present a detailed protocol for ubIa-Ms that proceeds in five stages: (i) chemical synthesis of ubiquitin precursors and click chemistry for the generation of biotinylated nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin baits, (ii) in vitro affinity purification of ubiquitin interactors, (iii) on-bead interactor digestion, (iv) liquid chromatography (lc)\u2013Ms/Ms analysis and (v) data analysis to identify differentially enriched proteins. the computational analysis tools are freely available as an open-source r software package, including a graphical interface. typically, ubIa-Ms allows the identification of dozens to hundreds of ubiquitin interactors from any type of cell lysate, and can be used to study cell type or stimulus-dependent ubiquitin interactions. the nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin synthesis can be completed in 3 weeks, followed by ubiquitin interactor enrichment and identification, which can be completed within another 2 weeks.", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Zhang X."}, {"name": "Smits A.H."}, {"name": "Van Tilburg G.B.A."}, {"name": "Ovaa H."}, {"name": "Huber W."}, {"name": "Vermeulen M."}], "date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Protocols"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Arne Smits", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "smits.arne@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dep", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEP.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Differential gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3223"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-20T17:35:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This package provides an integrated analysis workflow for robust and reproducible analysis of mass spectrometry proteomics data for differential protein expression or differential enrichment.
