                "abstract": "\u00a9 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited.ubiquitin-binding proteins play an important role in eukaryotes by translating differently linked polyubiquitin chains into proper cellular responses. current knowledge about ubiquitin-binding proteins and ubiquitin linkage-selective interactions is mostly based on case-by-case studies. We have recently reported a method called ubiquitin interactor affinity enrichment\u2013mass spectrometry (ubIa-Ms), which enables comprehensive identification of ubiquitin interactors for all ubiquitin linkages from crude cell lysates. one major strength of ubIa-Ms is the fact that ubiquitin interactors are enriched from crude cell lysates, in which proteins are present at endogenous levels, contain biologically relevant post-translational modifications (ptMs) and are assembled in native protein complexes. In addition, ubIa-Ms uses chemically synthesized nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin, which mimics native diubiquitin and is inert to cleavage by endogenous deubiquitinases (DuBs). Here, we present a detailed protocol for ubIa-Ms that proceeds in five stages: (i) chemical synthesis of ubiquitin precursors and click chemistry for the generation of biotinylated nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin baits, (ii) in vitro affinity purification of ubiquitin interactors, (iii) on-bead interactor digestion, (iv) liquid chromatography (lc)\u2013Ms/Ms analysis and (v) data analysis to identify differentially enriched proteins. the computational analysis tools are freely available as an open-source r software package, including a graphical interface. typically, ubIa-Ms allows the identification of dozens to hundreds of ubiquitin interactors from any type of cell lysate, and can be used to study cell type or stimulus-dependent ubiquitin interactions. the nonhydrolyzable diubiquitin synthesis can be completed in 3 weeks, followed by ubiquitin interactor enrichment and identification, which can be completed within another 2 weeks.",
