      "sc:description": "Diffusion MRI Multi-Compartment Modeling and Microstructure Recovery Made Easy.\n\nAn open source toolbox for reproducible diffusion MRI-based microstructure estimation.\n\nDmipy: Diffusion Microstructure Imaging in Python.\n\nThe Dmipy software package facilitates the reproducible estimation of diffusion MRI-based microstructure features. It does this by taking a completely modular approach to Microstructure Imaging. Using Dmipy you can design, fit, and recover the parameters of any multi-compartment microstructure model in usually less than 10 lines of code. Created models can be used to simulate and fit data for any PGSE-based dMRI acquisition, including single shell, multi-shell, multi-diffusion time and multi-TE acquisition schemes. Dmipy's main features include:",
