  "sc:description": "compmerge is a program that tries to solve the same problem as cuffmerge. It is not limited to cufflinks/stringtie models and transcripts, but can work with any GTF file. It merges the spliced transcripts that have a compatible intron structure and merges the monoexonic transcripts based on simple stranded overlap.The output is a GTF file of merged transcripts.",
