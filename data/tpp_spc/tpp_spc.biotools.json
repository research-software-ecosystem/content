More recently the democratization of comprehensive proteomics technologies is enabling the determination of the cellular phenotype and the molecular events that define its dynamic state. Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality. We conclude by describing some common perils that affect the analysis of MS/MS datasets, as well as some major upcoming features.",

Here, we describe the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a collection of software tools, to facilitate the analysis, exchange, and comparison of MS data. The pipeline is instrument-independent and supports most commonly used proteomics workflows, including quantitative applications such as ICAT, iTRAQ, and SILAC. Importantly, the pipeline uses open, standard data formats and calculates accurate estimates of sensitivity and error rates, thus allowing for meaningful data exchange. In this chapter, we will introduce the various components of the pipeline in the context of three typical proteomic use-case scenarios.",

The technique, however, presents a number of challenges for large-scale use, including the diverse raw data file formats output by mass spectrometers, the large false positive rate among peptide assignments to MS/MS spectra, and the loss of connectivity between identified peptides and the sample proteins that gave rise to them. Here we describe the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline, a freely available open source software suite that provides uniform analysis of LC-MS/MS data from raw data to quantified sample proteins. In a straightforward manner, users can extract MS/MS information from raw data of many instrument formats, submit them to search engines for peptide identification, validate the results to remove false hits, combine together results of multiple search engines, infer sample proteins that gave rise to the identified peptides, and perform quantitation at the peptide and protein levels.",
