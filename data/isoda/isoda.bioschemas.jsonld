      "sc:description": "IsoDA is a tool for Isoform-Disease Association Prediction by Multiomics Data Fusion. A gene can be spliced into different isoforms by alternative splicing, which contributes to the functional diversity of protein species. Computational prediction of gene-disease associations (GDAs) has been studied for decades. However, the process of identifying the isoform-disease associations (IDAs) at a large scale is rarely explored, which can decipher the pathology at a more granular level. The main bottleneck is the lack of IDAs in current databases and the multilevel omics data fusion. To bridge this gap, we propose a computational approach called Isoform-Disease Association prediction by multiomics data fusion (IsoDA) to predict IDAs",
