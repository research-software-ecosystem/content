description: NanoStringQCPro provides a set of quality metrics that can be used to
  assess the quality of NanoString mRNA gene expression data -- i.e. to identify outlier
  probes and outlier samples. It also provides different background subtraction and
  normalization approaches for this data. It outputs suggestions for flagging samples/probes
  and an easily sharable html quality control output.
