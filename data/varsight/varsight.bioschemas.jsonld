      "sc:description": "prioritizing clinically reported variants with binary classification algorithms.\n\nVarSight is a collection of scripts used to test the application of classification algorithms for identifying variants that will be returned on a clinical report. VarSight relies on Codicem to perform common clinical pipeline pre-processing, namely variant annotation and filtering. In addition to data available in Codicem, it also uses gene rankings that are based on Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms using both a built in calculation (cosine score) and the external tool PyxisMap. The classifiers in VarSight ingest a total of 95 features that are run through a feature selection process to get the top 20 features. Those 20 features are used to test both classification of reported variants and prioritization of reported variants in a larger filtered list. Results from the latest version of VarSight tests are available in the folder labeled \"paper\"",
