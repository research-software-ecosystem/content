description: "This package addresses a common problem in bioinformatics that has become\
  \ routine now also in clinical research: the assembly and comparison of the very\
  \ long genomic DNA sequences from many short reads that the machines provide. .\
  \ SOAPaligner/soap2 is a member of the Short Oligonucleotide Analysis Package (SOAP)\
  \ and an updated version of SOAP software for short oligonucleotide alignment (soap\
  \ v1). The new program features in super fast and accurate alignment for huge amounts\
  \ of short reads generated by Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer. Compared to soap\
  \ v1, it is one order of magnitude faster. It require only 2 minutes aligning one\
  \ million single-end reads onto the human reference genome. Another remarkable improvement\
  \ of SOAPaligner is that it now supports a wide range of the read length. . SOAPaligner/soap2\
  \ benefitted in time and space efficiency by a revolution in the basic data structures\
  \ and algorithms used. The core algorithms and the indexing data structures (2way-BWT)\
  \ are developed by the algorithms research group of the Department of Computer Science,\
  \ the University of Hong Kong (T.W. Lam, Alan Tam, Simon Wong, Edward Wu and S.M.\
  \ Yiu).\n"
