summary: aligner of short reads of next generation sequencers
description: >
   This package addresses a common problem in bioinformatics that has
   become routine now also in clinical research: the assembly and
   comparison of the very long genomic DNA sequences from many
   short reads that the machines provide.
   .
   SOAPaligner/soap2 is a member of the Short Oligonucleotide Analysis
   Package (SOAP) and an updated version of SOAP software for short
   oligonucleotide alignment (soap v1). The new program features in super
   fast and accurate alignment for huge amounts of short reads generated by
   Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer. Compared to soap v1, it is one order
   of magnitude faster. It require only 2 minutes aligning one million
   single-end reads onto the human reference genome. Another remarkable
   improvement of SOAPaligner is that it now supports a wide range of the
   read length.
   .
   SOAPaligner/soap2 benefitted in time and space efficiency by a revolution
   in the basic data structures and algorithms used. The core algorithms and
   the indexing data structures (2way-BWT) are developed by the algorithms
   research group of the Department of Computer Science, the University
   of Hong Kong (T.W. Lam, Alan Tam, Simon Wong, Edward Wu and S.M. Yiu).
