However, many complex diseases and human conditions, particularly behavioral disorders, are rated on ordinal scales. Herein, we introduce, LOT, a tool that performs linkage analysis of ordinal traits for pedigree data. It implements a latent-variable proportional-odds logistic model that relates inheritance patterns to the distribution of the ordinal trait. The likelihood-ratio test is used for testing evidence of linkage. © The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.
