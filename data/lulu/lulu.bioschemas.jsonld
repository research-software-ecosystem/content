      "sc:description": "A flexible pipeline combining bioinformatic correction tools for prokaryotic and eukaryotic metabarcoding | r package for post-clustering curation of amplicon next generation sequencing data (metabarcoding) | The purpose of LULU is to reduce the number of erroneous OTUs in OTU tables to achieve more realistic biodiversity metrics. By evaluating the co-occurence patterns of OTUs among samples LULU identifies OTUs that consistently satisfy some user selected criteria for being errors of more abundant OTUs and merges these. It has been shown that curation with LULU consistently result in more realistic diversity metrics. The required input of LULU is an OTU table and a corresponding matchlist with all the internal matches of OTUs | A r-package for distribution based post clustering curation of amplicon data",
