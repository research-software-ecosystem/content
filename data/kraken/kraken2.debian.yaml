  description: taxonomic classification system using exact k-mer matches
  long_description: " Kraken 2 is the newest version of Kraken, a taxonomic classification\n\
    \ system using exact k-mer matches to achieve high accuracy and fast\n classification\
    \ speeds. This classifier matches each k-mer within a query\n sequence to the\
    \ lowest common ancestor (LCA) of all genomes containing\n the given k-mer. The\
    \ k-mer assignments inform the classification\n algorithm. [see: Kraken 1's Webpage\
    \ for more details].\n .\n Kraken 2 provides significant improvements to Kraken\
    \ 1, with faster\n database build times, smaller database sizes, and faster classification\n\
    \ speeds. These improvements were achieved by the following updates to the\n Kraken\
    \ classification program:\n .\n  1. Storage of Minimizers: Instead of storing/querying\
    \ entire k-mers,\n     Kraken 2 stores minimizers (l-mers) of each k-mer. The\
    \ length of\n     each l-mer must be ≤ the k-mer length. Each k-mer is treated\
    \ by\n     Kraken 2 as if its LCA is the same as its minimizer's LCA.\n  2. Introduction\
    \ of Spaced Seeds: Kraken 2 also uses spaced seeds to\n     store and query minimizers\
    \ to improve classification accuracy.\n  3. Database Structure: While Kraken 1\
    \ saved an indexed and sorted list\n     of k-mer/LCA pairs, Kraken 2 uses a compact\
    \ hash table. This hash\n     table is a probabilistic data structure that allows\
    \ for faster\n     queries and lower memory requirements. However, this data structure\n\
    \     does have a <1% chance of returning the incorrect LCA or returning\n   \
    \  an LCA for a non-inserted minimizer. Users can compensate for this\n     possibility\
    \ by using Kraken's confidence scoring thresholds.\n  4. Protein Databases: Kraken\
    \ 2 allows for databases built from amino\n     acid sequences. When queried,\
    \ Kraken 2 performs a six-frame\n     translated search of the query sequences\
    \ against the database.\n  5. 16S Databases: Kraken 2 also provides support for\
    \ databases not\n     based on NCBI's taxonomy. Currently, these include the 16S\n\
    \     databases: Greengenes, SILVA, and RDP.\n"
