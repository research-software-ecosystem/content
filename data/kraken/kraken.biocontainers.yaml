description: System for assigning taxonomic labels to short dna sequences, usually
  obtained through metagenomic studies. previous attempts by other bioinformatics
  software to accomplish this task have often used sequence alignment or machine learning
  techniques that were quite slow, leading to the development of less sensitive but
  much faster abundance estimation programs. it aims to achieve high sensitivity and
  high speed by utilizing exact alignments of k-mers and a novel classification algorithm.
