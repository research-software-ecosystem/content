This article introduces a new nonparametric method, which provides a two-dimensional representation of a structural parameter called the genetical bandwidth, which describes genetic structure around arbitrary spatial locations in a study area. This parameter corresponds to the shortest distance to areas of significant allele variation, and its computation is based on the Womble's systemic function. A simulation study and application to data sets taken from the literature give evidence that the method is particularly demonstrative when the fine-scale structure is stronger than the large-scale structure, and that it is generally able to locate genetic boundaries or clines precisely. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Inc.
