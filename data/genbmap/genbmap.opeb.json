This article introduces a new nonparametric method, which provides a two-dimensional representation of a structural parameter called the genetical bandwidth, which describes genetic structure around arbitrary spatial locations in a study area. This parameter corresponds to the shortest distance to areas of significant allele variation, and its computation is based on the Womble's systemic function. A simulation study and application to data sets taken from the literature give evidence that the method is particularly demonstrative when the fine-scale structure is stronger than the large-scale structure, and that it is generally able to locate genetic boundaries or clines precisely. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It was developped by Alain Cercueil, O. Fran?ois and S. Manel. The method is essentially descriptive, and allows an user to analyze genotypes and geographic coordinates simultaneously through a two dimensional graphical representation. GenBMAP provides a basis for the interpretation of the genetic structure of a population.","homepage":"http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/software.html","name":"GENBMAP","version":["1.0"]}}
