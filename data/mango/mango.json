Current ChIA-PET analysis software packages either fail to correct for non-specific interactions due to genomic proximity or only address a fraction of the steps required for data processing. We present Mango, a complete ChIA-PET data analysis pipeline that provides statistical confidence estimates for interactions and corrects for major sources of bias including differential peak enrichment and genomic proximity. Results: Comparison to the existing software packages, ChIA-PET Tool and ChiaSig revealed that Mango interactions exhibit much better agreement with high-resolution Hi-C data. Importantly, Mango executes all steps required for processing ChIA-PET datasets, whereas ChiaSig only completes 20% of the required steps. Application of Mango to multiple available ChIA-PET datasets permitted the independent rediscovery of known trends in chromatin loops including enrichment of CTCF, RAD21, SMC3 and ZNF143 at the anchor regions of interactions and strong bias for convergent CTCF motifs.", "citationCount": 23, "authors": [{"name": "Phanstiel D.H."}, {"name": "Boyle A.P."}, {"name": "Heidari N."}, {"name": "Snyder M.P."}], "date": "2015-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "PHANSTIEL LAB", "url": "https://github.com/dphansti/mango", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "dphansti@email.unc.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mango", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/dphansti/mango", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2945"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Complete ChIA-PET (Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag sequencing) data analysis pipeline that provides statistical confidence estimates for interactions and corrects for major sources of bias including differential peak enrichment and genomic proximity.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mango-chia-pet-analysis-software.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mango", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:50:36Z", "name": "Mango", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/dphansti/mango/blob/master/README.rst", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
