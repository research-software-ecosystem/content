  description: reference based multiple sequence alignment
  long_description: " SINA is a tool to add sequences to an existing multiple sequence\n\
    \ alignment. It needs about 1 second on a single core to add one 16S full\n length\
    \ sequence (about 100k/h on a 32-core workstation). It was\n developed to create\
    \ the multi-million sequence alignment that is the\n core of the SILVA SSU and\
    \ LSU rRNA databases."
