    "description": "A reference-free, whole genome profiling system to address cytosine/adenine methylation changes.\n\nMethods for investigating DNA methylation nowadays either require a reference genome and high coverage, or investigate only CG methylation. Moreover, no large-scale analysis can be performed for N6-methyladenosine (6 mA) at an affordable price. Here we describe the methylation content sensitive enzyme double-digest restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) technique (MCSeEd), a reduced-representation, reference-free, cost-effective approach for characterizing whole genome methylation patterns across different methylation contexts (e.g., CG, CHG, CHH, 6 mA). MCSeEd can also detect genetic variations among hundreds of samples. MCSeEd is based on parallel restrictions carried out by combinations of methylation insensitive and sensitive endonucleases, followed by next-generation sequencing.",
