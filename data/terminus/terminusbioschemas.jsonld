  "sc:description": "N-Terminal Acetylation and initial methionine predictor based on patterns discovery and decision trees. The proposed algorithm builds a decision tree, by coupling the C4.5 algorithm with genetic algorithms, producing high-performance white box classifiers. Our method was tested on the initiator methionine cleavage (IMC) and NÎ±-terminal acetylation (N-Ac), two of the most common PTMs.",
