  "sc:description": "An algorithm for the alignment of two proteins. Specifically, core regions in two protein structures are first aligned by identifying connected components in a network of neighboring, geometrically compatible aligned fragment pairs (AFPs). The initial alignments then are refined through a multi-objective optimization method. The algorithm can produce both sequential and non-sequential alignments.",
