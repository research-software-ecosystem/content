  "sc:description": "It can get the samples' inversion status of known inversions. It uses SNP data as input and requires the following information about the inversion: genotype frequencies in the different haplotypes, R2 between the region SNPs and inversion status and heterozygote genotypes in the reference. The package include this data for two well known inversions and for two additional regions.",
