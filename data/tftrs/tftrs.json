    "description": "conservation, variation and implications for efflux-mediated antimicrobial resistance.\n\nBACKGROUND:TetR-family transcriptional regulators (TFTRs) are DNA binding factors that regulate gene expression in bacteria. Well-studied TFTRs, such as AcrR, which regulates efflux pump expression, are usually encoded alongside target operons. Recently, it has emerged that there are many TFTRs which act as global multi-target regulators. Our classical view of TFTRs as simple, single-target regulators therefore needs to be reconsidered. As some TFTRs regulate essential processes (e.g. metabolism) or processes which are important determinants of resistance and virulence (e.g. biofilm formation and efflux gene expression) and as TFTRs are present throughout pathogenic bacteria, they may be good drug discovery targets for tackling antimicrobial resistant infections.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TetR-family transcription factors Gram-negative bacteria'",
