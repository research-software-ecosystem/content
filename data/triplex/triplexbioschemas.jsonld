The main functionality is to detect the positions of subsequences capable of folding into an intramolecular triplex (H-DNA) in a much larger sequence. The potential H-DNA (triplexes) should be made of as many cannonical nucleotide triplets as possible. The package includes visualization showing the exact base-pairing in 1D, 2D or 3D.",
