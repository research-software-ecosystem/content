biotools_id: triplex
description: This package provides functions for identification and visualization
  of potential intramolecular triplex patterns in DNA sequence. The main functionality
  is to detect the positions of subsequences capable of folding into an intramolecular
  triplex (H-DNA) in a much larger sequence. The potential H-DNA (triplexes) should
  be made of as many cannonical nucleotide triplets as possible. The package includes
  visualization showing the exact base-pairing in 1D, 2D or 3D.
