description: 'Statistical tools for ChIP-seq data analysis. The package includes the
  statistical method described in Kaufmann et al. (2009) PLoS Biology: 7(4):e1000090.
  Briefly, Taking the average DNA fragment size subjected to sequencing into account,
  the software calculates genomic single-nucleotide read-enrichment values. After
  normalization, sample and control are compared using a test based on the Poisson
  distribution. Test statistic thresholds to control the false discovery rate are
  obtained through random permutation.'
