description: Current gene set enrichment methods rely upon permutations for inference.  These
  approaches are computationally expensive and have minimum achievable p-values based
  on the number of permutations, not on the actual observed statistics.  We have derived
  three parametric approximations to the permutation distributions of two gene set
  enrichment test statistics.  We are able to reduce the computational burden and
  granularity issues of permutation testing with our method, which is implemented
  in this package. npGSEA calculates gene set enrichment statistics and p-values without
  the computational cost of permutations.  It is applicable in settings where one
  or many gene sets are of interest.  There are also built-in plotting functions to
  help users visualize results.
