    "description": "An Online Application to Aid Matching Peptide Pairs with Isotopically Labelled PTMs | MOTIVATION:Database searching of isotopically labelled PTMs can be problematic and we frequently find that only one, or neither in a heavy light pair are assigned. In such cases, having a pair of MS MS spectra that differ due to an isotopic label can assist in identifying the relevant m z values that support the correct peptide annotation or can be used for de novo sequencing. RESULTS:We have developed an online application that identifies matching peaks and peaks differing by the appropriate mass shift (difference between heavy and light PTM) between two MS MS spectra. Furthermore, the application predicts, from the exact-match peaks, the mass of their complementary ions and highlights these as high confidence matches between the two spectra",
