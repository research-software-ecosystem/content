summary: tools for generating images of proteins or other molecules
description: >
   Raster3D is a set of tools for generating high quality raster images of
   proteins or other molecules. The core program renders spheres, triangles,
   cylinders, and quadric surfaces with specular highlighting, Phong shading,
   and shadowing. It uses an efficient software Z-buffer algorithm which is
   independent of any graphics hardware. Ancillary programs process atomic
   coordinates from PDB files into rendering descriptions for pictures composed
   of ribbons, space-filling atoms, bonds, ball+stick, etc. Raster3D can also be
   used to render pictures composed in other programs such as Molscript in
   glorious 3D with highlights, shadowing, etc. Output is to pixel image files
   with 24 bits of color information per pixel.
