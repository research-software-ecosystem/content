description: Set of tools for generating high quality raster images of proteins or
  other molecules. the core program renders spheres, triangles, cylinders, and quadric
  surfaces with specular highlighting, phong shading, and shadowing. it uses an efficient
  software z-buffer algorithm which is independent of any graphics hardware. output
  is to pixel image files with 24 bits of color information per pixel.
