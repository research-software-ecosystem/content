  "sc:description": "A normalization and copy number variation calling procedure for whole exome DNA sequencing data. The tool relies on the availability of multiple samples processed using the same sequencing pipeline for normalization, and does not require matched controls. The normalization model includes terms that specifically remove biases due to GC content, among others. It also includes a Poisson likelihood-based recursive segmentation procedure that explicitly models the count-based exome sequencing data.",
