It combines the age group, location, onset date and genotype of cases to infer their import status, and their likely infector. o2geosocial is based upon the R package \"outbreaker2\" (https://github.com/reconhub/outbreaker2), it is designed to study datasets that do not include genetic sequences but genotype of the cases. o2geosocial clusters cases from different genotypes in different trees, without computing the genetic distance between cases.",
