Though advances have been made in improving sepsis diagnosis and treatment, our understanding of the disease is far from complete. Mathematical modeling of sepsis has the potential to explore underlying biological mechanisms and patient phenotypes that contribute to variability in septic patient outcomes. We developed a comprehensive, whole-body mathematical model of sepsis pathophysiology using the BioGears Engine, a robust open-source virtual human modeling project. We describe the development of a sepsis model and the physiologic response within the BioGears framework. We then define and simulate scenarios that compare sepsis treatment regimens. As such, we demonstrate the utility of this model as a tool to augment sepsis research and as a training platform to educate medical staff.",
