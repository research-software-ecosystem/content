    "description": "Consensus Reverse Docking System for Target Fishing | MOTIVATION:Identification of putative drug targets is a critical step for explaining the mechanism of drug action against multiple targets, finding new therapeutic indications for existing drugs, and unveiling the adverse drug reactions. One important approach is to use the molecular docking. However, its widespread utilization has been hindered by the lack of easy-to-use public servers. Therefore, it is vital to develop a streamlined computational tool for target prediction by molecular docking on a large scale. RESULTS:We present a fully automated web tool named CRDS (Consensus Reverse Docking System) which predicts potential interaction sites for a given drug. To improve hit rates, we developed a strategy of consensus scoring",
