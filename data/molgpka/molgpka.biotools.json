Accurate and fast estimation of small molecule pKais vital during the drug discovery process. We present MolGpKa, a web server for pKaprediction using a graph-convolutional neural network model. The model works by learning pKarelated chemical patterns automatically and building reliable predictors with learned features. ACD/pKadata for 1.6 million compounds from the ChEMBL database was used for model training. We found that the performance of the model is better than machine learning models built with human-engineered fingerprints. Detailed analysis shows that the substitution effect on pKais well learned by the model. MolGpKa is a handy tool for the rapid estimation of pKaduring the ligand design process. The MolGpKa server is freely available to researchers and can be accessed athttps://xundrug.cn/molgpka.",
