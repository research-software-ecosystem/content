In order to shed light on the energetic side of interactions of amino acids between themselves and with deoxyribonucleotides, we present the Amino Acid Interaction web server (http://bioinfo.uochb.cas.cz/INTAA/). INTAA offers the calculation of the residue Interaction Energy Matrix for any protein structure (deposited in Protein Data Bank or submitted by the user) and a comprehensive analysis of the interfaces in protein-DNA complexes. The Interaction Energy Matrix web application aims to identify key residues within protein structures which contribute significantly to the stability of the protein. The application provides an interactive user interface enhanced by 3D structure viewer for efficient visualization of pairwise and net interaction energies of individual amino acids, side chains and backbones. The protein-DNA interaction analysis part of the web server allows the user to view the relative abundance of various configurations of amino acid-deoxyribonucleotide pairs found at the protein-DNA interface and the interaction energies corresponding to these configurations calculated using a molecular mechanical force field. The effects of the sugar-phosphate moiety and of the dielectric properties of the solvent on the interaction energies can be studied for the various configurations.","authors":["Galgonek J.","Vymetal J.","Jakubec D.","Vondrasek J."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkx352","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"Amino Acid Interaction (INTAA) web server","type":"Primary","year":"2017-07-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:intaa","biotoolsID":"intaa","description":"Calculates the residue Interaction Energy Matrix for any protein structure and offers comprehensive analysis of the interfaces in protein–DNA complexes.","homepage":"http://bioinfo.uochb.cas.cz/INTAA/","name":"Amino Acids Interactions Web Server","version":["1.0"]}}
