Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.Estimating the number of people in hidden populations is needed for public health research, yet available methods produce highly variable and uncertain results. The Anchored Multiplier calculator uses a Bayesian framework to synthesize multiple population size estimates to generate a consensus estimate. Users submit point estimates and lower/upper bounds which are converted to beta probability distributions and combined to form a single posterior probability distribution. The Anchored Multiplier calculator is available as a web browser-based application. The software allows for unlimited empirical population size estimates to be submitted and combined according to Bayes Theorem to form a single estimate. The software returns output as a forest plot (to visually compare data inputs and the final Anchored Multiplier estimate) and a table that displays results as population percentages and counts. The web application 'Anchored Multiplier Calculator' is free software and is available at [http://globalhealthsciences.ucsf.edu/resources/tools] or directly at [http://anchoredmultiplier.ucsf.edu/].",
