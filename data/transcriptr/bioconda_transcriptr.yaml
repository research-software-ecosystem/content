description: The differences in the RNA types being sequenced have an impact on the
  resulting sequencing profiles. mRNA-seq data is enriched with reads derived from
  exons, while GRO-, nucRNA- and chrRNA-seq demonstrate a substantial broader coverage
  of both exonic and intronic regions. The presence of intronic reads in GRO-seq type
  of data makes it possible to use it to computationally identify and quantify all
  de novo continuous regions of transcription distributed across the genome. This
  type of data, however, is more challenging to interpret and less common practice
  compared to mRNA-seq. One of the challenges for primary transcript detection concerns
  the simultaneous transcription of closely spaced genes, which needs to be properly
  divided into individually transcribed units. The R package transcriptR combines
  RNA-seq data with ChIP-seq data of histone modifications that mark active Transcription
  Start Sites (TSSs), such as, H3K4me3 or H3K9/14Ac to overcome this challenge. The
  advantage of this approach over the use of, for example, gene annotations is that
  this approach is data driven and therefore able to deal also with novel and case
  specific events. Furthermore, the integration of ChIP- and RNA-seq data allows the
  identification all known and novel active transcription start sites within a given
  sample.
