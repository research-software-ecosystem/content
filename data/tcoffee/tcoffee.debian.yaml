description: T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment package. Given a set of sequences
  (Proteins or DNA), T-Coffee generates a multiple sequence alignment. Version 2.00
  and higher can mix sequences and structures. . T-Coffee allows the combination of
  a collection of multiple/pairwise, global or local alignments into a single model.
  It can also estimate the level of consistency of each position within the new alignment
  with the rest of the alignments. See the pre-print for more information . T-Coffee
  has a special called M-Coffee that makes it possible to combine the output of many
  multiple sequence alignment packages. In its published version, it uses MUSCLE,
  PROBCONS, POA, DiAlign-TS, MAFFT, Clustal W, PCMA and T-Coffee. A special version
  has been made for Debian, DM-Coffee, that uses only free software by replacing Clustal
  W by Kalign. Using the 8 Methods of M-Coffee can sometimes be a bit heavy. You can
  use a subset of your favorite methods if you prefer.
