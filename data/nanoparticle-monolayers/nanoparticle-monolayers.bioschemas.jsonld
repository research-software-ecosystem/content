      "sc:description": "A workflow for characterizing nanoparticle monolayers for biosensors.\n\nA persistent challenge in materials science is the characterization of a large ensemble of heterogeneous nanostructures in a set of images. This often leads to practices such as manual particle counting, and sampling bias of a favorable region of the “best” image. Herein, we present the open-source software, imaging criteria and workflow necessary to fully characterize an ensemble of SEM nanoparticle images. Such characterization is critical to nanoparticle biosensors, whose performance and characteristics are determined by the distribution of the underlying nanoparticle film.",
