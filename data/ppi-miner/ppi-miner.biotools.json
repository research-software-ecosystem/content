                "abstract": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play important roles in biological processes of life, and predicting PPIs becomes a critical scientific issue of concern. Most PPIs occur through small domains or motifs (fragments), which are challenging and laborious to map by standard biochemical approaches because they generally require the cloning of several truncation mutants. Here, we present a computational method, named as PPI-Miner, to fish potential protein interacting partners utilizing protein motifs as queries. In brief, this work first developed a motif-matching algorithm designed to identify the proteins that contain sequential or structural similar motifs with the given query motif. Being aligned to the query motif, the binding mode of the discovered motif and its receptor protein will be initially determined to be used to build PPI complexes accordingly. Eventually, a PPI complex structure could be built and optimized with a designed automatic protocol. Besides discovering PPIs, PPI-Miner can also be applied to other areas, i.e., the rational design of molecular glues and protein vaccines. In this work, PPI-Miner was employed to mine the potential cereblon (CRBN) substrates from human proteome. As a result, 1,739 candidates were predicted, and 16 of them have been experimentally validated in previous studies. The source code of PPI-Miner can be obtained from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/Wang-Lin-boop/PPI-Miner), the webserver is freely available for users (https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/ppi-miner), and the database of predicted CRBN substrates is accessible at https://bailab.siais.shanghaitech.edu.cn/services/crbn-subslib.",
