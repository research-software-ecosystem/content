Here based on a carefully assembled data set derived from experimental data for proteins in solution, we quantify backbone dynamics properties on the amino-acid level and develop DynaMine - a fast, high-quality predictor of protein backbone dynamics. DynaMine uses only protein sequence information as input and shows great potential in distinguishing regions of different structural organization, such as folded domains, disordered linkers, molten globules and pre-structured binding motifs of different sizes. It also identifies disordered regions within proteins with an accuracy comparable to the most sophisticated existing predictors, without depending on prior disorder knowledge or three-dimensional structural information. DynaMine provides molecular biologists with an important new method that grasps the dynamical characteristics of any protein of interest, as we show here for human p53 and E1A from human adenovirus 5.\u00a9 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Unfortunately, accurate protein dynamics information is difficult to obtain: here we present the DynaMine webserver, which provides predictions for the fast backbone movements of proteins directly from their amino-acid sequence. DynaMine rapidly produces a profile describing the statistical potential for such movements at residue-level resolution. The predicted values have meaning on an absolute scale and go beyond the traditional binary classification of residues as ordered or disordered, thus allowing for direct dynamics comparisons between protein regions. Through this webserver, we provide molecular biologists with an efficient and easy to use tool for predicting the dynamical characteristics of any protein of interest, even in the absence of experimental observations. The prediction results are visualized and can be directly downloaded. The DynaMine webserver, including instructive examples describing the meaning of the profiles, is available at http://dynamine.ibsquare.be. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 38, "authors": [{"name": "Cilia E."}, {"name": "Pancsa R."}, {"name": "Tompa P."}, {"name": "Lenaerts T."}, {"name": "Vranken W.F."}], "date": "2014-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "vub.ac.be", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Support"], "name": "Wim Vranken", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": null, "email": "wvranken@vub.ac.be"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Wim Vranken", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "wvranken@vub.ac.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dynamine", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://dynamine.ibsquare.be/", "function": [{"note": "Protein backbone dynamics prediction from sequence File containing one value per amino acid in each protein sequence", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Protein sequence (raw)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2974"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein features", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1277"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Protein backbone dynamics prediction from sequence.", "toolType": ["Web API", "Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "dynamine", "additionDate": "2016-05-31T11:29:42Z", "name": "DynaMine", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://dynamine.ibsquare.be/help/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
