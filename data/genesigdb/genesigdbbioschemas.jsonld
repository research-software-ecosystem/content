It focuses on cancer, development, and stem cell gene signatures and was constructed from thousands of publications from which we manually transcribe gene signatures. Gene signatures are mapped to the genome to extract standardized lists of EnsEMBL gene identifiers. It provides the original gene signature, the standardized gene list and a fully traceable gene mapping history for each gene.",
