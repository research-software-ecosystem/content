Bolotie is a new algorithm designed to conduct mutational analysis and to detect recombinant forms and other anomalies among a very large set of viral sequences. methods implemented in Bolotie are designed such that novel sequences can also be analyzed efficiently without the need to rerun the entire protocol.",
