    "description": "Bolotie is a tool for detecting recombinations in viruses using large data sets with high sequence similarity. Bolotie is a new algorithm designed to conduct mutational analysis and to detect recombinant forms and other anomalies among a very large set of viral sequences. methods implemented in Bolotie are designed such that novel sequences can also be analyzed efficiently without the need to rerun the entire protocol.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.The ability to detect recombination in pathogen genomes is crucial to the accuracy of phylogenetic analysis and consequently to forecasting the spread of infectious diseases and to developing therapeutics and public health policies. However, in case of the SARS-CoV-2, the low divergence of near-identical genomes sequenced over a short period of time makes conventional analysis infeasible. Using a novel method, we identified 225 anomalous SARS-CoV-2 genomes of likely recombinant origins out of the first 87,695 genomes to be released, several of which have persisted in the population. Bolotie is specifically designed to perform a rapid search for inter-clade recombination events over extremely large datasets, facilitating analysis of novel isolates in seconds. In cases where raw sequencing data were available, we were able to rule out the possibility that these samples represented co-infections by analyzing the underlying sequence reads. The Bolotie software and other data from our study are available at https://github.com/salzberg-lab/bolotie.",
