Summary: Identification of protein interaction subnetworks is an important step to help us understand complex molecular mechanisms in cancer. In this paper, we develop a BMRF-Net package, implemented in Java and C++, to identify protein interaction subnetworks based on a bagging Markov random field (BMRF) framework. By integrating gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data, this software tool can be used to identify biologically meaningful subnetworks. A user friendly graphic user interface is developed as a Cytoscape plugin for the BMRF-Net software to deal with the input/output interface. The detailed structure of the identified networks can be visualized in Cytoscape conveniently. The BMRF-Net package has been applied to breast cancer data to identify significant subnetworks related to breast cancer recurrence.","authors":["Shi X.","Barnes R.O.","Chen L.","Shajahan-Haq A.N.","Hilakivi-Clarke L.","Clarke R.","Wang Y.","Xuan J."],"cit_count":7,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btv137","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"BMRF-Net: A software tool for identification of protein interaction subnetworks by a bagging Markov random field-based method","type":"Primary","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:BMRF-Net","biotoolsID":"BMRF-Net","description":"Software tool for identification of protein interaction subnetworks by a bagging Markov random field-based method.","homepage":"https://sourceforge.net/projects/bmrfcjava/","name":"BMRF-Net"}}
