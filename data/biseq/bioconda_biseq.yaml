description: The BiSeq package provides useful classes and functions to handle and
  analyze targeted bisulfite sequencing (BS) data such as reduced-representation bisulfite
  sequencing (RRBS) data. In particular, it implements an algorithm to detect differentially
  methylated regions (DMRs). The package takes already aligned BS data from one or
  multiple samples.
