    "description": "Given admixed individuals' bi-allelic SNP genotypes and ancestry pairs (where each ancestry can take one of three values) for multiple SNPs, perform an EM algorithm to deal with the fact that SNP genotypes are unphased with respect to ancestry pairs, in order to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies for all SNPs.",

In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of an admixed population, such as Hispanic Americans, ancestry-specific allele frequencies can inform the design of a replication GWAS. We derive an EM algorithm to estimate ancestry-specific allele frequencies for a bi-allelic marker given genotypes and local ancestries on a 3-way admixed population, when the phase of each admixed individual's genotype relative to the pair of local ancestries is unknown. We call our algorithm Ancestry Specific Allele Frequency Estimation (ASAFE). We demonstrate that ASAFE has low error on simulated data. Availability and implementation: The R source code for ASAFE is available for download at https://github.com/BiostatQian/ASAFE Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
