It allows for the adjustment of additional covariates and is robust towards the inclusion of noncausal variants and variants having effects with different magnitudes and directions. Furthermore, it can coherently account for missing genotypes and conjoin in a principled way individuals or variants sequenced at varying coverage depths.",
