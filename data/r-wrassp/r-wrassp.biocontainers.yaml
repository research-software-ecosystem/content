description: A wrapper around Michel Scheffers libassp (<http://libassp.sourceforge.net/>).
  The libassp (Advanced Speech Signal Processor) library aims at providing functionality
  for handling speech signal files in most common audio formats and for performing
  analyses common in phonetic science/speech science. This includes the calculation
  of formants, fundamental frequency, root mean square, auto correlation, a variety
  of spectral analyses, zero crossing rate, filtering etc. This wrapper provides R
  with a large subset of libassp signal processing functions and provides them to
  the user in a (hopefully) user-friendly manner.
