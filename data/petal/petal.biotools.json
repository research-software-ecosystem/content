    "description": "PETAL (ParallEl paThways AnaLyzer): a python tool for deep analysis of biological pathways.\n\n\nPETAL software is written in the Python 3 programming language. It contains a set of tools for pathway analysis and discovery of novel therapeutic targets. The approach allows you to scan and perform a in-depth search of the biological pathway to analyze less recurrent pathways, detect nodes that are far from the initial target nodes and showing the pathway of origin from which it was taken the gene.",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: Although several bioinformatics tools have been developed to examine signaling pathways, little attention has been given to ever long-distance crosstalk mechanisms. Here, we developed PETAL, a Python tool that automatically explores and detects the most relevant nodes within a KEGG pathway, scanning and performing an in-depth search. PETAL can contribute to discovering novel therapeutic targets or biomarkers that are potentially hidden and not considered in the network under study. Availabilityand implementation: PETAL is a freely available open-source software. It runs on all platforms that support Python3. The user manual and source code are accessible from https://github.com/Pex2892/PETAL.",
