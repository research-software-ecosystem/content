biotools_id: procoil
description: The package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence (amino
  acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form a dimer or more likely
  to form a trimer. Additionally to the prediction itself, a prediction profile is
  computed which allows for determining the strengths to which the individual residues
  are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles can also be visualized as curves
  or heatmaps.
