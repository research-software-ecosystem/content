Multidomain proteins can be challenging for protein structure modeling, particularly those for which templates can be found for individual domains but not for the entire sequence. In such cases, homology modeling can generate high quality models of the domains but not for the orientations between domains. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) reports the structural properties of entire proteins and has the potential for guiding homology modeling of multidomain proteins. In this article, we describe a novel multidomain protein assembly modeling method, SAXSDom that integrates experimental knowledge from SAXS with probabilistic Input-Output Hidden Markov model to assemble the structures of individual domains together. Four SAXS-based scoring functions were developed and tested, and the method was evaluated on multidomain proteins from two public datasets. Incorporation of SAXS information improved the accuracy of domain assembly for 40 out of 46 critical assessment of protein structure prediction multidomain protein targets and 45 out of 73 multidomain protein targets from the ab initio domain assembly dataset. The results demonstrate that SAXS data can provide useful information to improve the accuracy of domain-domain assembly.
