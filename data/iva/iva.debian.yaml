summary: iterative virus sequence assembler
description: >
   IVA is a de novo assembler designed to assemble
   virus genomes that have no repeat sequences,
   using Illumina read pairs sequenced from mixed
   populations at extremely high depth.
   .
   IVA's main algorithm works by iteratively extending
   contigs using aligned read pairs. Its input can be
   just read pairs, or additionally you can provide an
   existing set of contigs to be extended. Alternatively,
   it can take reads together with a reference sequence.
version: 1.0.9+ds
