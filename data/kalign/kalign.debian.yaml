description: Kalign is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of biological
  sequences. It employs the Muth-Manber string-matching algorithm, to improve both
  the accuracy and speed of the alignment. It uses global, progressive alignment approach,
  enriched by employing an approximate string-matching algorithm to calculate sequence
  distances and by incorporating local matches into the otherwise global alignment.
