description: "Kalign is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of biological\
  \ sequences. It employs the Muth-Manber string-matching algorithm, to improve both\
  \ the accuracy and speed of the alignment. It uses global, progressive alignment\
  \ approach, enriched by employing an approximate string-matching algorithm to calculate\
  \ sequence distances and by incorporating local matches into the otherwise global\
  \ alignment.\n"
