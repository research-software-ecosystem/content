    "description": "LncRNA Spatial Atlas of Expression across Normal and Cancer Tissues.\n\nKnowledge of lncRNA spatial expression patterns across tissues is important for identifying their roles in different tissues that provide important insights into disease mechanisms and tissue-specific therapeutic targets, especially the tissue elevated lncRNAs (TE lncRNAs), which expressed higher in a certain tissue or groups, and either not expressed or expressed at lower levels in other tissues.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) play important roles in maintaining morphology and function of tissues, and their regulatory effectiveness is closely associated with spatial expression. To provide a comprehensive spatial atlas of expression for lncRNA, we propose LncSpA (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/LncSpA) to explore tissue-elevated (TE) lncRNA across human normal and adult and pediatric cancer tissues. In total, 71,131 and 12,007 TE lncRNAs and 634 clinical-related TE lncRNAs were identified across 38 normal and 33 adult cancer tissues. Moreover, 4,688 TE and 413 clinical-related lncRNAs were identified in pediatric cancer. By quick searching or query options, users can obtain eight major types of detailed information for lncRNA via various visualization techniques, including qualitative and quantitative spatial expression in different resources, coexpressed mRNAs, predicted function, known disease association, and the potential to serve as diagnostic or prognostic markers. LncSpA will be a valuable resource to understand lncRNA functions across tissues and cancers, leading to enhanced therapeutic strategies in precision oncology.",
