It contains fully referenced information about recognition and cleavage sites, isoschizomers, neoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. Experimentally characterized homing endonucleases are also included. The fastest growing segment of REBASE contains the putative R-M systems found in the sequence databases. Comprehensive descriptions of the R-M content of all fully sequenced genomes are available including summary schematics. The contents of REBASE may be browsed from the web (http.://rebase.neb.com) and selected compilations can be downloaded by ftp (ftp.neb.com). Additionally, monthly updates can be requested via email. © The Author(s) 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.",
