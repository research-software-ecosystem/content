Our method goes from DNA extraction to data analysis with a computational in-house pipeline. The system was extensively validated using three publicly available Coriell samples, estimating accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Multiple runs were also made to assess repeatability and reproducibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Three different Coriell samples were analyzed in a single run to perform coverage, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, reproducibility and repeatability analysis",
