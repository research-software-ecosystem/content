description: Performs ratio, GC content correction and normalization of data obtained
  using low coverage (one read every 100-10,000 bp) high troughput sequencing. It
  performs a "discrete" normalization looking for the ploidy of the genome. It will
  also provide tumour content if at least two ploidy states can be found.
