  "sc:description": "Performs an automated and systematic analysis of periodic patterns in the position of a set of genomic features of interest along the genome. A complete analysis runs: detection of all possible periods from the positions of the genomic features, clustering of genomic features that are “in-phase” for every significant period found, and mapping of all the regions of the genome showing periodicities. Each step generates rich and interactive visualisations as well as machine-readable files.",
