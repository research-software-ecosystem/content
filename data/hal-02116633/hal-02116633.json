    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'histological atlases' | MRI Atlas of the Human Deep Brain | Mastering detailed anatomy of the human deep brain in clinical neurosciences is challenging. Although numerous pioneering works have gathered a large dataset of structural and topographic information, it is still difficult to transfer this knowledge into practice, even with advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques. Thus, classical histological atlases continue to be used to identify structures for stereotactic targeting in functional neurosurgery. Physicians mainly use these atlases as a template co-registered with the patient's brain. However, it is possible to directly identify stereotactic targets on MRI scans, enabling personalized targeting",
