    "description": "Tool for fusion discovery with paired-end RNA-Seq reads. The tool follows a different strategy by \u201cfinding fusions directly and verifying them\u201d, differentiating it from all other existing tools by \u201cfinding the candidate regions and searching for the fusions afterwards\u201d. This enables the fusion discovery process to be more effective and sensitive, also with a specular performance under low coverage of sequencing far more better than other tools.\nhttp://soap.genomics.org.cn/SOAPfusion.html",

                "abstract": "Motivation: RNA-Seq provides a powerful approach to carry out ab initio investigation of fusion transcripts representing critical translocation and post-transcriptional events that recode hereditary information. Most of the existing computational fusion detection tools are challenged by the issues of accuracy and how to handlemultiplemappings. Results:We present a novel tool SOAPfusion for fusion discovery with paired-end RNA-Seq reads. SOAPfusion is accurate and efficient for fusion discovery with high sensitivity (\u226593%), low false-positive rate (\u22641.36%), even the coverage is as low as 10\u00d7, highlighting its ability to detect fusions efficiently at low sequencing cost. From real data of Universal Human Reference RNA (UHRR) samples, SOAPfusion detected 7 novel fusion genes, more than other existing tools and all genes have been validated through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction followed by Sanger sequencing. SOAPfusion thus proves to be an effective method with precise applicability in search of fusion transcripts, which is advantageous to accelerate pathological and therapeutic cancer studies. \u00a9 The Author 2013.
