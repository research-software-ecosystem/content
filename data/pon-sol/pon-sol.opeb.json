It is of great interest because of its relevance to protein expression. Reduced solubility and protein aggregation are also associated with many diseases. Results: We collected from literature the largest experimentally verified solubility affecting amino acid substitution (AAS) dataset and used it to train a predictor called PON-Sol. The predictor can distinguish both solubility decreasing and increasing variants from those not affecting solubility. PONSol has normalized correct prediction ratio of 0.491 on cross-validation and 0.432 for independent test set. The performance of the method was compared both to solubility and aggregation predictors and found to be superior. PON-Sol can be used for the prediction of effects of disease-related substitutions, effects on heterologous recombinant protein expression and enhanced crystallizability. One application is to investigate effects of all possible AASs in a protein to aid protein engineering.","authors":["Yang Y.","Niroula A.","Shen B.","Vihinen M."],"cit_count":10,"doi":"10.1093/BIOINFORMATICS/BTW066","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"27153720","title":"PON-Sol: Prediction of effects of amino acid substitutions on protein solubility","year":"2016-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pon-sol","biotoolsID":"pon-sol","description":"Prediction of effects of amino acid substitutions on protein solubility.","homepage":"http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-Sol","name":"PON-Sol"}}
