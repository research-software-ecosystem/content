It is of great interest because of its relevance to protein expression. Reduced solubility and protein aggregation are also associated with many diseases. Results: We collected from literature the largest experimentally verified solubility affecting amino acid substitution (AAS) dataset and used it to train a predictor called PON-Sol. The predictor can distinguish both solubility decreasing and increasing variants from those not affecting solubility. PONSol has normalized correct prediction ratio of 0.491 on cross-validation and 0.432 for independent test set. The performance of the method was compared both to solubility and aggregation predictors and found to be superior. PON-Sol can be used for the prediction of effects of disease-related substitutions, effects on heterologous recombinant protein expression and enhanced crystallizability. One application is to investigate effects of all possible AASs in a protein to aid protein engineering.", "citationCount": 10, "authors": [{"name": "Yang Y."}, {"name": "Niroula A."}, {"name": "Shen B."}, {"name": "Vihinen M."}], "date": "2016-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mauno Vihinen", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mauno.vihinen@med.lu.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pon-sol", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-Sol", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein solubility prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0409"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Prediction of effects of amino acid substitutions on protein solubility.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "pon-sol", "additionDate": "2018-05-01T17:07:47Z", "name": "PON-Sol", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://structure.bmc.lu.se/PON-Sol/about/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
