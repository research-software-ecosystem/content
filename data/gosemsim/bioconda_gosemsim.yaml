description: The semantic comparisons of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations provide quantitative
  ways to compute similarities between genes and gene groups, and have became important
  basis for many bioinformatics analysis approaches. GOSemSim is an R package for
  semantic similarity computation among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene products
  and gene clusters. GOSemSim implemented five methods proposed by Resnik, Schlicker,
  Jiang, Lin and Wang respectively.
