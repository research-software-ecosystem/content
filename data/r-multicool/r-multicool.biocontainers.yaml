description: A set of tools to permute multisets without loops or hash tables and
  to generate integer partitions. The permutation functions are based on C code\nfrom
  Aaron Williams. Cool-lex order is similar to colexicographical order. The algorithm\nis
  described in Williams, A. Loopless Generation of Multiset Permutations by Prefix\nShifts.
  SODA 2009, Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, New York, United States. The\npermutation
  code is distributed without restrictions. The code for stable and efficient\ncomputation
  of multinomial coefficients comes from Dave Barber. The code can be\ndownload from
  http://home.comcast.net/~tamivox/dave/multinomial/index.html and is distributed
  without conditions. The package also generates the integer partitions of a positive,
  non-zero integer n. The C++ code for this is based on Python code from Jerome Kelleher
  which can be found here http://jeromekelleher.net/partitions.php. The C++ code and
  Python code are distributed without conditions.
