    "description": "Alignment-free filtering for cfNA fusion fragments | AF4 is an alignment free fusion detector that can work with RNA-seq data, cfRNA data and cfDNA data. It consists of two stages. In stage one, it identifies candidate fusion fragments and the corresponding fusion pairs. In the second stage, a list of filtering criteria are applied to narrow down the fusion candidates | This directory contains scripts we used internally to run benchmarks presented in the ISMB paper. It may or may not run in your environment | Method: AF4 decomposes each fragment into kmers and identifies for each kmer the corresponding genes",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Cell-free nucleic acid (cfNA) sequencing data require improvements to existing fusion detection methods along multiple axes: high depth of sequencing, low allele fractions, short fragment lengths and specialized barcodes, such as unique molecular identifiers. Results: AF4 was developed to address these challenges. It uses a novel alignment-free kmer-based method to detect candidate fusion fragments with high sensitivity and orders of magnitude faster than existing tools. Candidate fragments are then filtered using a max-cover criterion that significantly reduces spurious matches while retaining authentic fusion fragments. This efficient first stage reduces the data sufficiently that commonly used criteria can process the remaining information, or sophisticated filtering policies that may not scale to the raw reads can be used. AF4 provides both targeted and de novo fusion detection modes. We demonstrate both modes in benchmark simulated and real RNA-seq data as well as clinical and cell-line cfNA data.",
