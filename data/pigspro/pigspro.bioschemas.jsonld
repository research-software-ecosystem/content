It has a user-friendly and flexible interface, that allows the user to choose templates (for the frameworks and the loops) and modeling strategies in an automatic or manual fashion. Its final output is a complete three-dimensional model of the target antibody that can be downloaded or displayed on-line. The server is freely accessible to all.",
