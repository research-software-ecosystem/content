Metavisitor is a software package that allows biologists and clinicians without specialized bioinformatics expertise to detect and assemble viral genomes from deep sequence datasets. The package is composed of a set of modular bioinformatic tools and workflows that are implemented in the Galaxy framework. Using the graphical Galaxy workflow editor, users with minimal computational skills can use existing Metavisitor workflows or adapt them to suit specific needs by adding or modifying analysis modules. Metavisitor works with DNA, RNA or small RNA sequencing data over a range of read lengths and can use a combination of de novo and guided approaches to assemble genomes from sequencing reads. We show that the software has the potential for quick diagnosis as well as discovery of viruses from a vast array of organisms. Importantly, we provide here executable Metavisitor use cases, which increase the accessibility and transparency of the software, ultimately enabling biologists or clinicians to focus on biological or medical questions.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Carissimo G."}, {"name": "Van Den Beek M."}, {"name": "Vernick K.D."}, {"name": "Antoniewski C."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Christophe Antoniewski", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "christophe.antoniewski@upmc.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:metavisitor", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/ARTbio/metavisitor", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-12-14T20:33:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Software package that allows biologists and clinicians without specialized bioinformatics expertise to detect and assemble viral genomes from deep sequence datasets.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["Naira"]}, "language": ["Shell"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "metavisitor", "additionDate": "2018-06-02T07:43:28Z", "name": "Metavisitor", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://artbio.github.io/Metavisitor-manual/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
