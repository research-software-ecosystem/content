        "description": "a novel and conserved DnaA-related protein that targets the RIDA process to stimulate replication initiation.\n\nExquisite control of the DnaA initiator is critical to ensure that bacteria initiate chromosome replication in a cell cycle-coordinated manner. In many bacteria, the DnaA-related and replisome-associated Hda HdaA protein interacts with DnaA to trigger the Regulatory Inactivation of DnaA (RIDA) and prevent over-initiation events. In the Caulobacter crescentus Alphaproteobacterium, the RIDA process also targets DnaA for its rapid proteolysis by Lon. The impact of the RIDA process on adaptation of bacteria to changing environments remains unexplored. Here, we identify a novel and conserved DnaA-related protein, named HdaB, and show that homologs from three different Alphaproteobacteria can inhibit the RIDA process, leading to over-initiation and cell death when expressed in actively growing C. crescentus cells.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
