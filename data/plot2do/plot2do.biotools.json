    "description": "Creating 2D Occupancy Plots Using plot2DO.\n\nMicrococcal nuclease digestion followed by deep sequencing (MNase-seq) is the most used method to investigate nucleosome organization on a genome-wide scale. We present plot2DO, a flexible tool for evaluating the quality of MNase-seq and MNase-ChIP-seq data, and for visualizing the distribution of nucleosomes near the functional regions of the genome. Apart from MNase-seq data analysis, plot2DO was also used to investigate DNA fragments obtained in other types of experiments, such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and chemical cleavage mapping. In principle, plot2DO can be used to analyze the amount of DNA that is obtained from different regions of the genome, and the corresponding distribution of fragment sizes for each region, independent of the protocol that is used to generate the short DNA fragments.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Chromatin organization and epigenetic marks play a critical role in stem cell pluripotency and differentiation. Chromatin digestion by micrococcal nuclease (MNase) followed by high-throughput sequencing (MNase-seq) is the most widely used genome-wide method for studying nucleosome organization, that is, the first level of DNA packaging into chromatin. Combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), MNase-ChIP-seq represents a high-resolution method for investigating both chromatin organization and the distribution of epigenetic marks and histone variants. The plot2DO package presented here is a flexible tool for evaluating the quality of MNase-seq and MNase-ChIP-seq data, and for visualizing the distribution of nucleosomes near the functional regions of the genome. The plot2DO package is open-source software, and it is freely available from https://github.com/rchereji/plot2DO under the MIT license.",
