The program analyses X-Y coordinate data exported from commercially available tracking software. Pathfinder currently supports outputs from: Ethovision, Anymazy, WaterMaze, and ezTrack. We then calculate the best-fit search strategy for the trial. Trials are fit into one of: Direct Swim, Directed Search, Focal Search, Spatial indirect, Chaining, Scanning, Thigmotaxis, and Random Search",
