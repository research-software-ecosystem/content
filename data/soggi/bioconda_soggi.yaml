description: The soGGi package provides a toolset to create genomic interval aggregate/summary
  plots of signal or motif occurence from BAM and bigWig files as well as PWM, rlelist,
  GRanges and GAlignments Bioconductor objects. soGGi allows for normalisation, transformation
  and arithmetic operation on and between summary plot objects as well as grouping
  and subsetting of plots by GRanges objects and user supplied metadata. Plots are
  created using the GGplot2 libary to allow user defined manipulation of the returned
  plot object. Coupled together, soGGi features a broad set of methods to visualise
  genomics data in the context of groups of genomic intervals such as genes, superenhancers
  and transcription factor binding events.
