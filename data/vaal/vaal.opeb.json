VAAL detected ∼98% of differences (including large insertion-deletions) between pairs of strains from three species while calling no false positives. VAAL also pinpointed a single mutation between Vibrio cholerae genomes, identifying an antibiotic's site of action by identifying sequence differences between drug-sensitive strains and drug-resistant derivatives.","authors":["Nusbaum C.","Ohsumi T.K.","Gomez J.","Aquadro J.","Victor T.C.","Warren R.M.","Hung D.T.","Birren B.W.","Lander E.S.","Jaffe D.B."],"cit_count":57,"journal":"Nature Methods","pmid":"19079253","title":"Sensitive, specific polymorphism discovery in bacteria using massively parallel sequencing","year":"2009-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vaal","biotoolsID":"vaal","description":"Variant ascertainment algorithm that can be used to detect SNPs, indels, and more complex genetic variants.","homepage":"http://archive.broadinstitute.org/crd/vaal-manual","name":"VAAL"}}
