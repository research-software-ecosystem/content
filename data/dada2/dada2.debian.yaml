summary: sample inference from amplicon sequencing data
description: >
   The dada2 package contributes to software workflows to interpret
   sequencing data from microbiota - the relative abundance of
   bacterial and/or yeast, typically measured in the gut.
   It infers exact amplicon sequence
   variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon sequencing data,
   replacing the coarser and less accurate OTU clustering approach.
   The dada2 pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq files, and
   outputs the sequence variants and their sample-wise abundances
   after removing substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic
   classification is available via a native implementation of the RDP
   naive Bayesian classifier, and species-level assignment to 16S
   rRNA gene fragments by exact matching.
