description: The dada2 package infers exact amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) from
  high-throughput amplicon sequencing data, replacing the coarser and less accurate
  OTU clustering approach. The dada2 pipeline takes as input demultiplexed fastq files,
  and outputs the sequence variants and their sample-wise abundances after removing
  substitution and chimera errors. Taxonomic classification is available via a native
  implementation of the RDP naive Bayesian classifier, and species-level assignment
  to 16S rRNA gene fragments by exact matching.
