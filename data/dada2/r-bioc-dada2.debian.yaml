  description: sample inference from amplicon sequencing data
  long_description: " The dada2 package contributes to software workflows to interpret\n\
    \ sequencing data from microbiota - the relative abundance of\n bacterial and/or\
    \ yeast, typically measured in the gut.\n It infers exact amplicon sequence\n\
    \ variants (ASVs) from high-throughput amplicon sequencing data,\n replacing the\
    \ coarser and less accurate OTU clustering approach.\n The dada2 pipeline takes\
    \ as input demultiplexed fastq files, and\n outputs the sequence variants and\
    \ their sample-wise abundances\n after removing substitution and chimera errors.\
    \ Taxonomic\n classification is available via a native implementation of the RDP\n\
    \ naive Bayesian classifier, and species-level assignment to 16S\n rRNA gene fragments\
    \ by exact matching.\n"
