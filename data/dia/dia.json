    "description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PASEF', 'diaPASEF', 'Mobi-DIK' | Our goal is to develop high throughput method for sampling peptides with a mass spectrometer that can be used as a quantitative measure of the phenotype. To do this we would like a tandem mass spectrometry (MS MS) method that can comprehensively sample all peptides in a sample continuously throughout the chromatographic elution. MS MS acquired using data independent acquisition (DIA) offers significant advantages in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, and dynamic range over a single stage of mass analysis. Quantitative analysis using MS MS has significant technical advantages over MS1 analysis and we are just now in a situation where we can get high selectivity (<4 m z) across a majority of the mass range (i.e. 400 1000 m z) using a rapid duty cycle (<3 sec). That said, this does not mean that there are not substantial challenges to overcome",
