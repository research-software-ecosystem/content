description: MBttest method was developed from beta t-test method of Baggerly et al(2003).
  Compared to baySeq (Hard castle and Kelly 2010), DESeq (Anders and Huber 2010) and
  exact test (Robinson and Smyth 2007, 2008) and the GLM of McCarthy et al(2012),
  MBttest is of high work efficiency,that is, it has high power, high conservativeness
  of FDR estimation and high stability. MBttest is suit- able to transcriptomic data,
  tag data, SAGE data (count data) from small samples or a few replicate libraries.
  It can be used to identify genes, mRNA isoforms or tags differentially expressed
  between two conditions.
