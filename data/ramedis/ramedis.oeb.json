This new approach will improve collecting valuable data from single case reports. Ramedis saves standardised patient data which will be usable for statistics, longitudinal examinations and cooperative studies in future time. Embedded in the scene of the German Human Genome Project, Ramedis directly will enable phenotype-genotype correlations. Beside the better characterisation of clinical heterogeneity of rare metabolic diseases, there may be a great benefit for the treatment of these patients in whom prospective studies are otherwise expensive and difficult to perform. This contribution presents the motivation for this sytem, introduces features, current state and the future of the project. Additionally, first experiences of using Ramedis by health professionals are explained.",
