To address this problem we have developed a new gene identification algorithm, GenomeScan, which combines exon-intron and splice signal models with similarity to known protein sequences in an integrated model. Extensive testing shows that GenomeScan can accurately identify the exon-intron structures of genes in finished or draft human genome sequence with a low rate of false-positives. Application of GenomeScan to 2.7 billion bases of human genomic DNA identified at least 20,000-25,000 human genes out of an estimated 30,000-40,000 present in the genome. The results show an accurate and efficient automated approach for identifying genes in higher eukaryotic genomes and provide a first-level annotation of the draft human genome.", "citationCount": 252, "authors": [{"name": "Yeh R.-F."}, {"name": "Lim L.P."}, {"name": "Burge C.B."}], "date": "2001-05-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Chris Burge", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "cburge@mit.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:genomescan", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://genes.mit.edu/genomescan/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Splicing model analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2499"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Program for identifying the exon-intron structures of genes in genomic DNA sequences from a variety of organisms, with a focus on human and other vertebrates.
