The algorithm combines two principal sources of information: 1) models of exon-intron and splice signal composition; and 2) sequence similarity information such as BLASTX hits.",

                "abstract": "With the human genome sequence approaching completion, a major challenge is to identify the locations and encoded protein sequences of all human genes. To address this problem we have developed a new gene identification algorithm, GenomeScan, which combines exon-intron and splice signal models with similarity to known protein sequences in an integrated model. Extensive testing shows that GenomeScan can accurately identify the exon-intron structures of genes in finished or draft human genome sequence with a low rate of false-positives. Application of GenomeScan to 2.7 billion bases of human genomic DNA identified at least 20,000-25,000 human genes out of an estimated 30,000-40,000 present in the genome. The results show an accurate and efficient automated approach for identifying genes in higher eukaryotic genomes and provide a first-level annotation of the draft human genome.",
