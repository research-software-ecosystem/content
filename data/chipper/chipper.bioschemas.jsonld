This increase in digital recordings necessitates an increase in high-throughput methods of analysis for researchers. Specifically, there is a need in the community for open-source methods that are tailored to recordings of varying qualities and from multiple species collected in nature. We developed Chipper, a Python-based software to semi-automate both the segmentation of acoustic signals and the subsequent analysis of their frequencies and durations.",
