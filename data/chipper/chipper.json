    "description": "Open-source software for semi-automated segmentation and analysis of birdsong and other natural sounds.\n\nAbstract <jats:list list-type=\"order\"><jats:list-item> Audio recording devices have changed significantly over the last 50 years, making large datasets of recordings of natural sounds, such as birdsong, easier to obtain. This increase in digital recordings necessitates an increase in high-throughput methods of analysis for researchers. Specifically, there is a need in the community for open-source methods that are tailored to recordings of varying qualities and from multiple species collected in nature. <jats:list-item> We developed Chipper, a Python-based software to semi-automate both the segmentation of acoustic signals and the subsequent analysis of their frequencies and durations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
