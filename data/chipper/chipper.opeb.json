This increase in digital recordings necessitates an increase in high-throughput methods of analysis for researchers. Specifically, there is a need in the community for open-source methods that are tailored to recordings of varying qualities and from multiple species collected in nature. <jats:list-item> We developed Chipper, a Python-based software to semi-automate both the segmentation of acoustic signals and the subsequent analysis of their frequencies and durations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/807974","name":"Chipper"}}
