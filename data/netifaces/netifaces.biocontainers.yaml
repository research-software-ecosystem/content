description: Its been annoying me for some time that theres no easy way to get the
  address(es) of the machines network interfaces from Python. There is a good reason
  for this difficulty, which is that it is virtually impossible to do so in a portable
  manner. However, it seems to me that there should be a package you can easy_install
  that will take care of working out the details of doing so on the machine you are
  using, then you can get on with writing Python code without concerning yourself
  with the nitty gritty of system-dependent low-level networking APIs.
