                "abstract": "\u00a9 Wallner 2020.Model quality assessment programs estimate the quality of protein models and can be used to estimate local error in protein models. ProQ3D is the most recent and most accurate version of our software. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to use local error estimates to substantially increase the quality of the models for molecular replacement (MR). Adjusting the B factors using ProQ3D improved the log-likelihood gain (LLG) score by over 50% on average, resulting in significantly more successful models in MR compared with not using error estimates. On a data set of 431 homology models to address difficult MR targets, models with error estimates from ProQ3D received an LLG of >50 for almost half of the models 209/431 (48.5%), compared with 175/431 (40.6%) for the previous version, ProQ2, and only 74/431 (17.2%) for models with no error estimates, clearly demonstrating the added value of using error estimates to enable MR for more targets. ProQ3D is available from http://proq3.bioinfo.se/ both as a server and as a standalone download.",
