    "description": "An Integrative De Novo Variant Knowledge Base for Developmental Disorders.\n\nNeuroPsychiatric Mutation Knowledge Base.\n\nWelcome to our open access database PsyMuKB.\n\nPsyMuKB is a comprehensive knowledge base that links transcriptional and translational annotations to de novo variants, which are found in subjects but not in their parents, in developmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Large-scale genomic and proteomic data are integrated into PsyMuKB, including developmental brain expressions, neuronal single-cell transcriptome, regulatory elements, and transcript annotations, protein-protein interactions (PPI) and protein isoform expressions. It aims to provide users with a comprehensive data exploration of de novo variants, such as their genomic locations on alternatively spliced isoforms, expression patterns of the mutation-disrupted genes and/or isoforms, and interaction network of impacted proteins",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsDe novo variants (DNVs) are one of the most significant contributors to severe early-onset genetic disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and other developmental and neuropsychiatric (DNP) disorders. Presently, a plethora of DNVs have been identified using next-generation sequencing, and many efforts have been made to understand their impact at the gene level. However, there has been little exploration of the effects at the isoform level. The brain contains a high level of alternative splicing and regulation, and exhibits a more divergent splicing program than other tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to explore variants at the transcriptional regulation level to better interpret the mechanisms underlying DNP disorders. To facilitate a better usage and improve the isoform-level interpretation of variants, we developed NeuroPsychiatric Mutation Knowledge Base (PsyMuKB). It contains a comprehensive, carefully curated list of DNVs with transcriptional and translational annotations to enable identification of isoform-specific mutations. PsyMuKB allows a flexible search of genes or variants and provides both table-based descriptions and associated visualizations, such as expression, transcript genomic structures, protein interactions, and the mutation sites mapped on the protein structures. It also provides an easy-to-use web interface, allowing users to rapidly visualize the locations and characteristics of mutations and the expression patterns of the impacted genes and isoforms. PsyMuKB thus constitutes a valuable resource for identifying tissue-specific DNVs for further functional studies of related disorders. PsyMuKB is freely accessible at http://psymukb.net.",
