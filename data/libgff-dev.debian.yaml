  description: GFF/GTF parsing from cufflinks as a library
  long_description: " This is a simple \"libraryfication\" of the GFF/GTF parsing\
    \ code that is used in\n the Cufflinks codebase.  There are not many (any?) relatively\
    \ lightweight\n GTF/GFF parsers exposing a C++ interface, and the goal of this\
    \ library is to\n provide this functionality without the necessity of drawing\
    \ in a heavy-weight\n dependency like SeqAn.\n"
