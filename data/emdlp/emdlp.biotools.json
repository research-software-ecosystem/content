                "abstract": "Background: Recent research recommends that epi-transcriptome regulation through post-transcriptional RNA modifications is essential for all sorts of RNA. Exact identification of RNA modification is vital for understanding their purposes and regulatory mechanisms. However, traditional experimental methods of identifying RNA modification sites are relatively complicated, time-consuming, and laborious. Machine learning approaches have been applied in the procedures of RNA sequence features extraction and classification in a computational way, which may supplement experimental approaches more efficiently. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) have been demonstrated achievements in modification site prediction on account of their powerful functions in representation learning. However, CNN can learn the local response from the spatial data but cannot learn sequential correlations. And LSTM is specialized for sequential modeling and can access both the contextual representation but lacks spatial data extraction compared with CNN. There is strong motivation to construct a prediction framework using natural language processing (NLP), deep learning (DL) for these reasons. Results: This study presents an ensemble multiscale deep learning predictor (EMDLP) to identify RNA methylation sites in an NLP and DL way. It organically combines the dilated convolution and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), which helps to take better advantage of the local and global information for site prediction. The first step of EMDLP is to represent the RNA sequences in an NLP way. Thus, three encodings, e.g., RNA word embedding, One-hot encoding, and RGloVe, which is an improved learning method of word vector representation based on GloVe, are adopted to decipher sites from the viewpoints of the local and global information. Then, a dilated convolutional Bidirectional LSTM network (DCB) model is constructed with the dilated convolutional neural network (DCNN) followed by BiLSTM to extract potential contributing features for methylation site prediction. Finally, these three encoding methods are integrated by a soft vote to obtain better predictive performance. Experiment results on m1A and m6A reveal that the area under the receiver operating characteristic(AUROC) of EMDLP obtains respectively 95.56%, 85.24%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To maximize user convenience, a user-friendly webserver for EMDLP was publicly available at http://www.labiip.net/EMDLP/index.php (http://47.104.130.81/EMDLP/index.php). Conclusions: We developed a predictor for m1A and m6A methylation sites.",
