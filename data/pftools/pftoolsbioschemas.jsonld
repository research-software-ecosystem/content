  "sc:description": "The pftools are a collection of programs to build, calibrate, and search biological sequences with generalized profiles. Generalized profiles are an extension of position specific scoring matrices by including position specific scores for insertions and deletions. They correspond to a matrix representation of a multiple sequence alignment that can be used to search distant homologous sequences and precisely align sequences to the model.",
