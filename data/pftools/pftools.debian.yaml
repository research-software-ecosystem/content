description: "The pftools package contains all the software necessary to build protein\
  \ and DNA generalized profiles and use them to scan and align sequences, and search\
  \ databases. . File formats used by the pftools\n * Generalized profiles format\
  \ and syntax.\n * The multiple sequence alignment format (PSA).\n * The extended\
  \ header multiple sequence alignment format (XPSA).\n. Programs to build generalized\
  \ profiles\n pfmake\n   Build a profile from a multiple sequence alignment.\n pfscale\n\
  \   Fit parameters of an extreme-value distribution to a profile score list.\n pfw\n\
  \   Weight sequences of a multiple sequence alignment to correct for\n   sampling\
  \ bias.\n. Programs to search with generalized profiles\n pfsearch / pfsearchV3\n\
  \   Search a protein or DNA sequence library for sequence segments matching\n  \
  \ a profile (V3 is the new version of this tool).\n pfscan\n   Scan a protein or\
  \ DNA sequence with a profile library\n. Conversion programs\n psa2msa\n   Reformat\
  \ PSA file to Pearson/Fasta multiple sequence alignment file.\n ptof\n   Convert\
  \ a protein profile into a frame-search profile to search DNA\n   sequences. To\
  \ be used with 2ft.\n 2ft\n   Converts both strands of DNA into so-called interleaved\n\
  \   frame-translated DNA sequences to search with protein profiles. To be\n   used\
  \ with ptof.\n 6ft\n   Translates all six reading frames of a double-stranded DNA\
  \ sequence\n   into individual protein sequences.\n pfgtop\n   Convert a profile\
  \ in GCG format into PROSITE format.\n pfhtop\n   Convert a HMMER1 ASCII-formatted\
  \ HMM into an equivalent PROSITE profile.\n ptoh\n   Converts a generalized profile\
  \ into an approximately equivalent HMM\n   profile in HMMER1 format (can be read\
  \ by the hmmconvert program from\n   the HMMER2 package).\n"
