  description: build and search protein and DNA generalized profiles
  long_description: " The pftools package contains all the software necessary to build\
    \ protein\n and DNA generalized profiles and use them to scan and align sequences,\n\
    \ and search databases.\n .\n File formats used by the pftools\n  * Generalized\
    \ profiles format and syntax.\n  * The multiple sequence alignment format (PSA).\n\
    \  * The extended header multiple sequence alignment format (XPSA).\n .\n Programs\
    \ to build generalized profiles\n  pfmake\n    Build a profile from a multiple\
    \ sequence alignment.\n  pfscale\n    Fit parameters of an extreme-value distribution\
    \ to a profile score list.\n  pfw\n    Weight sequences of a multiple sequence\
    \ alignment to correct for\n    sampling bias.\n .\n Programs to search with generalized\
    \ profiles\n  pfsearch / pfsearchV3\n    Search a protein or DNA sequence library\
    \ for sequence segments matching\n    a profile (V3 is the new version of this\
    \ tool).\n  pfscan\n    Scan a protein or DNA sequence with a profile library\n\
    \ .\n Conversion programs\n  psa2msa\n    Reformat PSA file to Pearson/Fasta multiple\
    \ sequence alignment file.\n  ptof\n    Convert a protein profile into a frame-search\
    \ profile to search DNA\n    sequences. To be used with 2ft.\n  2ft\n    Converts\
    \ both strands of DNA into so-called interleaved\n    frame-translated DNA sequences\
    \ to search with protein profiles. To be\n    used with ptof.\n  6ft\n    Translates\
    \ all six reading frames of a double-stranded DNA sequence\n    into individual\
    \ protein sequences.\n  pfgtop\n    Convert a profile in GCG format into PROSITE\
    \ format.\n  pfhtop\n    Convert a HMMER1 ASCII-formatted HMM into an equivalent\
    \ PROSITE profile.\n  ptoh\n    Converts a generalized profile into an approximately\
    \ equivalent HMM\n    profile in HMMER1 format (can be read by the hmmconvert\
    \ program from\n    the HMMER2 package).\n"
