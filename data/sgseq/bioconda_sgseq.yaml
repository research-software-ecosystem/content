description: SGSeq is a software package for analyzing splice events from RNA-seq
  data. Input data are RNA-seq reads mapped to a reference genome in BAM format. Genes
  are represented as a splice graph, which can be obtained from existing annotation
  or predicted from the mapped sequence reads. Splice events are identified from the
  graph and are quantified locally using structurally compatible reads at the start
  or end of each splice variant. The software includes functions for splice event
  prediction, quantification, visualization and interpretation.
