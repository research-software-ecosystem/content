ReDU is a launchpad for co- or re-analysis of public data via the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking Platform (GNPS). Our aim is to empower researchers to put their data in the context of public data as well as explore questions using public data at the repository scale | Reanalysis of Data User Interface | Projection of your data onto a precalculated principal components analysis score plot of public data","homepage":"https://redu.ucsd.edu/","name":"ReDU"}}
