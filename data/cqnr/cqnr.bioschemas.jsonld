De | CQNR - The phenomenon of the imbalanced dataset is common in classification. The existence of this problem is visible in many real-life domains, especially for biological datasets. Data imbalance problem can be tackled either by reducing the samples of the majority class or increasing the number of samples in the minority class. In this paper, we have introduced Cluster Quality based Non-Reductional over-sampling technique (CQNR). CQNR generates new samples proportional to the distribution of samples of the minority classes, without eliminating any sample of the minority class as noise",
