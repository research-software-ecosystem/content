    "description": "NanoCaller for accurate detection of SNPs and small indels from long-read sequencing by deep neural networks.\n\nAbstract Background Variant detection from high-throughput sequencing data remains an important, unresolved yet often overlooked problem. Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio sequencing, present unique advantages to detect SNPs and small indels in genomic regions that short-read sequencing cannot reliably examine (for example, only \u223c80% of genomic regions are marked as \u201chigh-confidence region\u201d to have SNP indel calls in the Genome In A Bottle project). However, existing software tools for short-read data perform poorly on long-read data; instead, several recent studies showed promising results in variant detection on long-read data by deep learning.",
