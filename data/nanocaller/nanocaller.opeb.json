Long-read sequencing technologies, such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio sequencing, present unique advantages to detect SNPs and small indels in genomic regions that short-read sequencing cannot reliably examine (for example, only ∼80% of genomic regions are marked as “high-confidence region” to have SNP indel calls in the Genome In A Bottle project). However, existing software tools for short-read data perform poorly on long-read data; instead, several recent studies showed promising results in variant detection on long-read data by deep learning.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.29.890418","name":"NanoCaller"}}
