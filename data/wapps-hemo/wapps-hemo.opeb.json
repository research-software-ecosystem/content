            "abstract": "© 2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Use of population pharmacokinetics (PopPK) to facilitate PK-informed prophylaxis in clinical practice has gained momentum among haemophilia providers due to the accessibility of tools such as the Web Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service—Hemophilia (WAPPS-Hemo) and availability of extended half-life (EHL) factor concentrates. It is unknown how clinicians implement PopPK. Aim: To investigate the evolution of PopPK use in clinical practice by comparing blood sampling strategies, patient features, and factor group between initial and recent periods of WAPPS-Hemo availability. Methods: PK data for haemophilia A and haemophilia B patients from two time periods were extracted from the WAPPS-Hemo database: early availability (10/2015-09/2016) and recent use (10/2017-09/2018). We compared patient characteristics (age, body weight, haemophilia type), product type and dose, and blood sampling times between the time frames. Results: Over 1900 eligible infusions were submitted to WAPPS-Hemo during the periods studied, with 85% representing FVIII concentrates. In the recent cohort, PK profiles were requested for younger patients (median age 18 vs 26 years), with increased proportional EHL FVIII use (29% vs 14% of infusions). High-use centres generally submitted fewer blood samples per infusion than non-high-use centres, although the number of samples collected by non-high-use centres decreased significantly over time. During both periods, blood sample timing was generally consistent with ISTH recommended windows. Conclusion: The use of WAPPS-Hemo by haemophilia providers grew by over threefold between the time periods investigated. While sampling times have included key time points proposed first by Björkman since early WAPPS-Hemo usage, a trend towards minimizing sampling was observed.",
