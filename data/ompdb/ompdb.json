The database currently contains 69 354 proteins, which are classified into 85 families, based mainly on structural and functional criteria. Although OMPdb follows the annotation scheme of Pfam, many of the families included in the database were not previously described or annotated in other publicly available databases. There are also cross-references to other databases, references to the literature and annotation for sequence features, like transmembrane segments and signal peptides. Furthermore, via the web interface, the user can not only browse the available data, but submit advanced text searches and run BLAST queries against the database protein sequences or domain searches against the collection of profile Hidden Markov Models that represent each family's domain organization as well. The database is freely accessible for academic users at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/OMPdb and we expect it to be useful for genome-wide analyses, comparative genomics as well as for providing training and test sets for predictive algorithms regarding transmembrane \u03b2-barrels. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 32, "authors": [{"name": "Tsirigos K.D."}, {"name": "Bagos P.G."}, {"name": "Hamodrakas S.J."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Pantelis Bagos", "url": "http://www.compgen.org/people/pbagos", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "pbagos@compgen.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ompdb", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.3"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ompdb.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "Data retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "OMPdb is a database of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins from Gram-negative bacteria", "toolType": ["Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["PHP", "SQL"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "ompdb", "additionDate": "2017-07-26T22:14:38Z", "name": "OMPdb", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ompdb.org/manual.php", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
