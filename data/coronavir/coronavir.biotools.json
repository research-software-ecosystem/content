                "abstract": "© 2020 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. publishers.A web-based resource CoronaVIR (http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/coronavir/) has been developed to maintain the predicted and existing information on coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We have integrated multiple modules, including \"Genomics,\"\"Diagnosis,\"\"Immunotherapy,\"and \"Drug Designing\"to understand the holistic view of this pandemic medical disaster. The genomics module provides genomic information of different strains of this virus to understand genomic level alterations. The diagnosis module includes detailed information on currently-in-use diagnostics tests as well as five novel universal primer sets predicted using in silico tools. The Immunotherapy module provides information on epitope-based potential vaccine candidates (e.g., LQLPQGTTLPKGFYA, VILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKK, EITVATSRTLS, GKGQQQQGQTV, SELVIGAVILR) predicted using state-of-the-art software and resources in the field of immune informatics. These epitopes have the potential to activate both adaptive (e.g., B cell and T cell) and innate (e.g., vaccine adjuvants) immune systems as well as suitable for all strains of SARS-CoV-2. Besides, we have also predicted potential candidates for siRNA-based therapy and RNA-based vaccine adjuvants. The drug designing module maintains information about potential drug targets, tertiary structures, and potential drug molecules. These potential drug molecules were identified from FDA-approved drugs using the docking-based approach. We also compiled information from the literature and Internet on potential drugs, repurposing drugs, and monoclonal antibodies. To understand host-virus interaction, we identified cell-penetrating peptides in the virus. In this study, state-of-the-art techniques have been used for predicting the potential candidates for diagnostics and therapeutics.",
