        "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'nondecision', 'DM', 'two-choice' | an R package for analyzing two-choice reaction time data with the D∗M method | The decision process in choice reaction time data is traditionally described in detail with diffusion models. However, the total reaction time is assumed to consist of the sum of a decision time (as modeled by the diffusion process) and the time devoted to nondecision processes (e.g., perceptual and motor processes). It has become standard practice to assume that the nondecision time is uniformly distributed. However, a misspecification of the nondecision time distribution introduces bias in the parameter estimates for the decision model. Recently, a new method has been proposed (called the D∗M method) that allows the estimation of the decision model parameters, while leaving the nondecision time distribution unspecified",
