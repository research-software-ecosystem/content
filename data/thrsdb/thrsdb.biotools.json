Published by Oxford University Press.As starch properties can affect end product quality in many ways, rice starch from Thai domesticated cultivars and landraces has been the focus of increasing research interest. Increasing knowledge in this area creates a high demand from the research community for better organized information. The Thai Rice Starch Database (ThRSDB) is an online database containing data extensively curated from original research articles on Thai rice starch composition, molecular structure and functionality. The key aim of the ThRSDB is to facilitate accessibility to dispersed rice starch information for, but not limited to, both research and industrial users. Currently, 373 samples from 191 different Thai rice cultivars have been collected from 39 published articles. The ThRSDB includes the search functions necessary for accessing data together with a user-friendly web interface and interactive visualization tools. We have also demonstrated how the collected data can be efficiently used to observe the relationships between starch parameters and rice cultivars through correlation analysis and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis.",
