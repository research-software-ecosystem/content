summary: Integrative Genomics Viewer
description: >
  The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that
  efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a
  smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution.
  A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of
  genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation
  sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data.
  Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources,
  its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and
  explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV
  supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is
  optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration
  on standard desktop systems.
