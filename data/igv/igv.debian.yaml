description: "The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that\
  \ efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and\
  \ intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic\
  \ of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support\
  \ for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration\
  \ of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data\
  \ from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to\
  \ visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end,\
  \ IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized\
  \ to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop\
  \ systems.\n"
