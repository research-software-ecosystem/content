    "description": "new binding kinetics database and its integration in an open-source binding analysis software.\n\nAn Online Tool for the Real-Time Kinetic Analysis of Binding Events.\n\nThere are two major ways to run Anabel. You can either run it locally on your PC (go to installation method 1) or host it for free online on shinyapps.io (go to installation method 2). Either way, you first need to install the current version of Cran R on your computer. If you do not have R yet, you can download it here:.\n\nProgram for the analysis of binding events.\n\nAn open source software for the platform-independent analysis of molecular binding events.\n\nIt is also possible to download Anabel. Please find all the information on this page: https://github.com/SKscience/Anabel.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no free app at the moment. Please check back later!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Anabel 2.0'",

Published by Oxford University Press.The kinetics of featured interactions (KOFFI) database is a novel tool and resource for binding kinetics data from biomolecular interactions. While binding kinetics data are abundant in literature, finding valuable information is a laborious task. We used text extraction methods to store binding rates (association, dissociation) as well as corresponding meta-information (e.g. methods, devices) in a novel database. To date, over 270 articles were manually curated and binding data on over 1705 interactions was collected and stored in the (KOFFI) database. Moreover, the KOFFI database application programming interface was implemented in Anabel (open-source software for the analysis of binding interactions), enabling users to directly compare their own binding data analyses with related experiments described in the database.",
