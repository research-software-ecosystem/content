It provides an interface to navigate through virus genome sequences, to design ORF-specific cloning primers, to validate the sequence of generated constructs and to browse established collections of virus ORFs. It has been designed to manage all possible variants or mutants of a given ORF so that the cloning procedure can be applied to any emerging virus strain.",
