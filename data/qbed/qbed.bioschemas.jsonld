      "sc:description": "a novel genome browser visualization for point processes.\n\nTransposon calling cards is a genomic assay for identifying transcription factor binding sites in both bulk and single cell experiments. Here we describe the qBED format, an open, text-based standard for encoding and analyzing calling card data. In parallel, we introduce the qBED track on the WashU Epigenome Browser, a novel visualization that enables researchers to inspect calling card data in their genomic context. Finally, through examples, we demonstrate that qBED files can be used to visualize non-calling card datasets, such as CADD scores and GWAS eQTL hits, and may have broad utility to the genomics community",
