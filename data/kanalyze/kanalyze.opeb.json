While existing software packages count k-mers, few are optimized for speed, offer an application programming interface (API), a graphical interface or contain features that make it extensible and maintainable. We designed KAnalyze to compete with the fastest k-mer counters, to produce reliable output and to support future development efforts through well-architected, documented and testable code. Currently, KAnalyze can output k-mer counts in a sorted tab-delimited file or stream k-mers as they are read. KAnalyze can process large datasets with 2 GB of memory. This project is implemented in Java 7, and the command line interface (CLI) is designed to integrate into pipelines written in any language. Results: As a k-mer counter, KAnalyze outperforms Jellyfish, DSK and a pipeline built on Perl and Linux utilities. Through extensive unit and system testing, we have verified that KAnalyze produces the correct k-mer counts over multiple datasets and k-mer sizes. © 2014 The Author 2014.","authors":["Audano P.","Vannberg F."],"cit_count":22,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24642064","title":"KAnalyze: A fast versatile pipelined K-mer toolkit","year":"2014-07-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:kanalyze","biotoolsID":"kanalyze","description":"Java toolkit designed to convert DNA and RNA sequences into k-mers.","homepage":"http://vannberg.biology.gatech.edu:8080/VannbergLab/kanalyze.html","name":"KAnalyze"}}
