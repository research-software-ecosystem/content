  "sc:description": "Alphabet takes a database of aligned protein sequences in BLOCKS+ format and examines the alignments column-wise looking for groups of amino acids that co-occur in columns more frequently than expected based on overall amino acid composition. These groups of amino acids can form a reduced alphabet for building sequence motifs (eMOTIFs) or for detecting correlations between columns of amino acids (MCSeq).",
