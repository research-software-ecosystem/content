We show that top-down proteogenomics allows one to address the problems that remained beyond the reach of traditional bottom-up proteogenomics. In particular, we show that top-down proteogenomics leads to the discovery of previously unannotated genes even in extensively studied bacterial genomes and present SpectroGene, a software tool for genome annotation using top-down tandem mass spectra. We further show that top-down proteogenomics searches (against the six-frame translation of a genome) identify nearly all proteoforms found in traditional top-down proteomics searches (against the annotated proteome).
