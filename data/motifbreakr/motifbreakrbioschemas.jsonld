      "sc:description": "Allows the biologist to judge in the first place whether the sequence surrounding the polymorphism is a good match, and in the second place how much information is gained or lost in one allele of the polymorphism relative to another. It is both flexible and extensible over previous offerings; giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of genomes with motifs from public sources. It can predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases.",
