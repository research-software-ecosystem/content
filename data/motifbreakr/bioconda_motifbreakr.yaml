biotools_id: motifbreakr
description: We introduce motifbreakR, which allows the biologist to judge in the
  first place whether the sequence surrounding the polymorphism is a good match, and
  in the second place how much information is gained or lost in one allele of the
  polymorphism relative to another. MotifbreakR is both flexible and extensible over
  previous offerings; giving a choice of algorithms for interrogation of genomes with
  motifs from public sources that users can choose from; these are 1) a weighted-sum
  probability matrix, 2) log-probabilities, and 3) weighted by relative entropy. MotifbreakR
  can predict effects for novel or previously described variants in public databases,
  making it suitable for tasks beyond the scope of its original design. Lastly, it
  can be used to interrogate any genome curated within Bioconductor (currently there
  are 22).
