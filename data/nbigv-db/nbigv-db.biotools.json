                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 Elsevier B.V.Immunoglobulins (Ig) are important immune molecules that possess highly diverse variable region sequences enabling antigen recognition. According to classical immune theory, B lymphocytes have been considered the only source of Ig production (B-Igs). However, accumulating evidence have suggested that Igs are also produced by many non-B cells (non-B Igs), including epithelial cells, neurons, germ cells, as well as myeloid cells of hemopoietic system. Besides acting as bona fide antibodies, Non-B Igs have alternative cellular functions, such as promotion of cell survival, adhesion and migration. More importantly, Unlike the unlimited sequence diversity of B-Igs, the non-B Igs exhibit conserved V(D)J patterns across the same lineages. To support the analysis and comparison of variable region sequences from Igs, produced by B and non-B cells, we established a database (NBIGV) constituted by a non-B Ig variable region repertoire, which includes 727,989 VHDJH and V\u03baJ\u03ba recombination sequences of non-B Igs sequenced from mouse samples. Upon database search, users can view, browse and investigate the variable region sequences of non-B Igs according to respective mice strains and tissues as well as Ig classes. Moreover, users can easily download selected sequences and/or compare sequences of interest with known non-B Ig sequences present in the database using NCBI-BLAST algorithms. Additionally, our database integrates a submission page and supplementary sample information. The NBIGV database may serve as a valuable resource for sequence analyses of Non-B Igs. NBIGV database is freely available at http://nbigv.org.",
