We have designed new polyvalent vaccine antigens comprised of sets of 'mosaic' proteins, assembled from fragments of natural sequences via a computational optimization method. Mosaic proteins resemble natural proteins, and a mosaic set maximizes the coverage of potential T-cell epitopes (peptides of nine amino acids) for a viral population. We found that coverage of viral diversity using mosaics was greatly increased compared to coverage by natural-sequence vaccine candidates, for both variable and conserved proteins; for conserved HIV-1 proteins, global coverage may be feasible. For example, four mosaic proteins perfectly matched 74% of 9-amino-acid potential epitopes in global Gag sequences; 87% of potential epitopes matched at least 8 of 9 positions. In contrast, a single natural Gag protein covered only 37% (9 of 9) and 67% (8 of 9). Mosaics provide diversity coverage comparable to that afforded by thousands of separate peptides, but, because the fragments of natural proteins are compressed into a small number of native-like proteins, they are tractable for vaccines. \u00a9 2007 Nature Publishing Group.", "citationCount": 264, "authors": [{"name": "Fischer W."}, {"name": "Perkins S."}, {"name": "Theiler J."}, {"name": "Bhattacharya T."}, {"name": "Yusim K."}, {"name": "Funkhouser R."}, {"name": "Kuiken C."}, {"name": "Haynes B."}, {"name": "Letvin N.L."}, {"name": "Walker B.D."}, {"name": "Hahn B.H."}, {"name": "Korber B.T."}], "date": "2007-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Medicine"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/www.lanl.gov", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "seq-info@lanl.gov"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mosaic_vaccine_designer", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/MOSAIC/makeVaccine.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Design", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2430"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Will generate candidate vaccine protein cocktails that optimize the coverage, by a small set of mosaic proteins that could be included in a vaccine cocktail, of potential T-cell epitopes in a large diverse set of proteins.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mosaic-vaccine-designer-1-2-11-generate-candidate-vaccine-protein-cocktails-optimize-coverage.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mosaic_vaccine_designer", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:51:49Z", "name": "Mosaic Vaccine Designer", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/TUTORIALS/Tutorials.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
