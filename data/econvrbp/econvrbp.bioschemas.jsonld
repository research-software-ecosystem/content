      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Improved ensemble convolutional neural networks for RNA binding protein prediction directly from sequence | RNA binding proteins (RBPs) determine RNA process from synthesis to decay, which play a key role in RNA transport, translation and degradation. Therefore, exploring RBPs' function from the amino acid sequence using computational methods has become one of the momentous topics in genome annotation. However, there still have some challenges: (1) shallow feature: Although the sequence determines structure is self-evident, it is difficult to analyze the essential features from simple sequence. (2) Poorly understand: feature-based prediction methods mainly emphasize feature extraction, while in-depth understanding of protein mysteries limits the application of feature engineering. (3) Feature fusion: multi-feature fusion is often used, but the features are not well integrated",
