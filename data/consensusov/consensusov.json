Surgery and chemotherapy are the mainstay of treatment, and molecular characterization is necessary to lead the way to targeted therapeutic options. To this end, various computational methods for gene expression-based subtyping of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) have been proposed, but their overlap and robustness remain unknown. Experimental Design: We assess three major subtype classifiers by meta-analysis of publicly available expression data, and assess statistical criteria of subtype robustness and classifier concordance. We develop a consensus classifier that represents the subtype classifications of tumors based on the consensus of multiple methods, and outputs a confidence score. Using our compendium of expression data, we examine the possibility that a subset of tumors is unclassifiable based on currently proposed subtypes. Results: HGSOC subtyping classifiers exhibit moderate pairwise concordance across our data compendium (58.9%-70.9%; P < 10-5) and are associated with overall survival in a meta-analysis across datasets (P < 10-5). Current subtypes do not meet statistical criteria for robustness to reclustering across multiple datasets (prediction strength < 0.6). A new subtype classifier is trained on concordantly classified samples to yield a consensus classification of patient tumors that correlates with patient age, survival, tumor purity, and lymphocyte infiltration. Conclusions: A new consensus ovarian subtype classifier represents the consensus of methods and demonstrates the importance of classification approaches for cancer that do not require all tumors to be assigned to a distinct subtype.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Chen G.M."}, {"name": "Kannan L."}, {"name": "Geistlinger L."}, {"name": "Kofia V."}, {"name": "Safikhani Z."}, {"name": "Gendoo D.M.A."}, {"name": "Parmigiani G."}, {"name": "Birrer M."}, {"name": "Haibe-Kains B."}, {"name": "Waldron L."}], "date": "2018-10-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Clinical Cancer Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Benjamin Haibe-Kains", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "benjamin.haibe.kains@utoronto.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:consensusov", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/consensusOV.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2990"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Differential gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3223"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Implementation of  four major subtype classifiers for high-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer.
