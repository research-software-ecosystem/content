Surgery and chemotherapy are the mainstay of treatment, and molecular characterization is necessary to lead the way to targeted therapeutic options. To this end, various computational methods for gene expression-based subtyping of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) have been proposed, but their overlap and robustness remain unknown. Experimental Design: We assess three major subtype classifiers by meta-analysis of publicly available expression data, and assess statistical criteria of subtype robustness and classifier concordance. We develop a consensus classifier that represents the subtype classifications of tumors based on the consensus of multiple methods, and outputs a confidence score. Using our compendium of expression data, we examine the possibility that a subset of tumors is unclassifiable based on currently proposed subtypes. Results: HGSOC subtyping classifiers exhibit moderate pairwise concordance across our data compendium (58.9%-70.9%; P < 10-5) and are associated with overall survival in a meta-analysis across datasets (P < 10-5). Current subtypes do not meet statistical criteria for robustness to reclustering across multiple datasets (prediction strength < 0.6). A new subtype classifier is trained on concordantly classified samples to yield a consensus classification of patient tumors that correlates with patient age, survival, tumor purity, and lymphocyte infiltration. Conclusions: A new consensus ovarian subtype classifier represents the consensus of methods and demonstrates the importance of classification approaches for cancer that do not require all tumors to be assigned to a distinct subtype.",
