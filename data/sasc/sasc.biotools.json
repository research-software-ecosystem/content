    "description": "Simulated Annealing Single Cell inference (SASC) tool -- cancer progression inference.\n\nSASC is a new model and a robust framework based on Simulated Annealing for the inference of cancer progression from the SCS data. The main objective is to overcome the limitations of the Infinite Sites Assumption by introducing a version of the k-Dollo parsimony model which indeed allows the deletion of mutations from the evolutionary history of the tumor.",

Published by Oxford University Press.MOTIVATION: In recent years, the well-known Infinite Sites Assumption has been a fundamental feature of computational methods devised for reconstructing tumor phylogenies and inferring cancer progressions. However, recent studies leveraging single-cell sequencing (SCS) techniques have shown evidence of the widespread recurrence and, especially, loss of mutations in several tumor samples. While there exist established computational methods that infer phylogenies with mutation losses, there remain some advancements to be made. RESULTS: We present Simulated Annealing Single-Cell inference (SASC): a new and robust approach based on simulated annealing for the inference of cancer progression from SCS datasets. In particular, we introduce an extension of the model of evolution where mutations are only accumulated, by allowing also a limited amount of mutation loss in the evolutionary history of the tumor: the Dollo-k model. We demonstrate that SASC achieves high levels of accuracy when tested on both simulated and real datasets and in comparison with some other available methods. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The SASC tool is open source and available at https://github.com/sciccolella/sasc. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
