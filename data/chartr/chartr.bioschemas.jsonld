      "sc:description": "An R toolbox for modeling choices and response times in decision-making tasks.\n\nBACKGROUND:Decision-making is the process of choosing and performing actions in response to sensory cues to achieve behavioral goals. Many mathematical models have been developed to describe the choice behavior and response time (RT) distributions of observers performing decision-making tasks. However, relatively few researchers use these models because it demands expertise in various numerical, statistical, and software techniques. NEW METHOD:We present a toolbox - Choices and Response Times in R, or ChaRTr - that provides the user the ability to implement and test a wide variety of decision-making models ranging from classic through to modern versions of the diffusion decision model, to models with urgency signals, or collapsing boundaries.",
