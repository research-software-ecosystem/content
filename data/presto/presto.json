Although promising, the high germline and somatic diversity, especially of B-cell immunoglobulin repertoires, presents challenges for analysis requiring the development of specialized computational pipelines. We developed the REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) for processing reads from high-throughput lymphocyte receptor studies. pRESTO processes raw sequences to produce error-corrected, sorted and annotated sequence sets, along with a wealth of metrics at each step. The toolkit supports multiplexed primer pools, single- or paired-end reads and emerging technologies that use single-molecule identifiers. pRESTO has been tested on data generated from Roche and Illumina platforms. It has a built-in capacity to parallelize the work between available processors and is able to efficiently process millions of sequences generated by typical high-throughput projects. \u00a9 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 69, "authors": [{"name": "Vander Heiden J.A."}, {"name": "Yaari G."}, {"name": "Uduman M."}, {"name": "Stern J.N.H."}, {"name": "O'connor K.C."}, {"name": "Hafler D.A."}, {"name": "Vigneault F."}, {"name": "Kleinstein S.H."}], "date": "2014-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://medicine.yale.edu/lab/kleinstein/index.aspx", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:presto", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://presto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Integrated collection of platform-independent Python modules for processing raw reads from high-throughput (next-generation) sequencing of lymphocyte repertoires.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/presto-0-4-4-processing-raw-reads-from-high-throughput-sequencing-of-lymphocyte-repertoires.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "presto", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:07:43Z", "name": "pRESTO", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://presto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}, {"url": "http://presto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html", "note": null, "type": "API documentation"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
