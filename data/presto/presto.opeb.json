Although promising, the high germline and somatic diversity, especially of B-cell immunoglobulin repertoires, presents challenges for analysis requiring the development of specialized computational pipelines. We developed the REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) for processing reads from high-throughput lymphocyte receptor studies. pRESTO processes raw sequences to produce error-corrected, sorted and annotated sequence sets, along with a wealth of metrics at each step. The toolkit supports multiplexed primer pools, single- or paired-end reads and emerging technologies that use single-molecule identifiers. pRESTO has been tested on data generated from Roche and Illumina platforms. It has a built-in capacity to parallelize the work between available processors and is able to efficiently process millions of sequences generated by typical high-throughput projects. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Vander Heiden J.A.","Yaari G.","Uduman M.","Stern J.N.H.","O'connor K.C.","Hafler D.A.","Vigneault F.","Kleinstein S.H."],"cit_count":69,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24618469","title":"PRESTO: A toolkit for processing high-throughput sequencing raw reads of lymphocyte receptor repertoires","year":"2014-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:presto","biotoolsID":"presto","description":"Integrated collection of platform-independent Python modules for processing raw reads from high-throughput (next-generation) sequencing of lymphocyte repertoires.","homepage":"http://presto.readthedocs.io/en/latest/","name":"pRESTO"}}
