The program, QUBIC, is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective biclustering methods for biological data interpretation. However, its availability is limited to a C implementation and to a low-throughput web interface.Results: An R implementation of QUBIC is presented here with two unique features: (i) a 82% average improved efficiency by refactoring and optimizing the source C code of QUBIC; and (ii) a set of comprehensive functions to facilitate biclustering-based biological studies, including the qualitative representation (discretization) of expression data, query-based biclustering, bicluster expanding, biclusters comparison, heatmap visualization of any identified biclusters and co-expression networks elucidation.Availability and Implementation: The package is implemented in R (as of version 3.3) and is available from Bioconductor at the URL: http://bioconductor.org/packages/QUBIC, where installation and usage instructions can be found.Contact: qin.ma@sdstate.eduSupplimentary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Zhang Y."}, {"name": "Xie J."}, {"name": "Yang J."}, {"name": "Fennell A."}, {"name": "Zhang C."}, {"name": "Ma Q."}], "date": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yu Zhang", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "zy26@jlu.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:qubic", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QUBIC.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0313"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-01-15T01:19:11Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The core function of this R package is to provide the implementation of the well-cited and well-reviewed algorithm, aiming to deliver an effective and efficient biclustering capability.
