For each protein,the database contains the redundant compilation of all the corresponding crystallographic structures obtained under different conditions. These structures could be considered as different instances of protein dynamism. As a measure of the conformational diversity we use the maximum RMSD obtained comparing the structures deposited for each domain. The redundant structures were extracted following CATH structural classification and cross linked with additional information. In this way it is possible to relate a given amount of conformational diversity with different levels of information,such as protein function,presence of ligands and mutations,structural classification,active site information and organism taxonomy among others. Currently the database contains 7989 domains with a total of 36581 structures from 4171 different proteins.
