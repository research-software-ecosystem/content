description: "Combining p-values from multiple statistical tests is common in bioinformatics.\
  \ however, this procedure is non-trivial for dependent p-values. this package implements\
  \ an empirical adaptation of brown\u2019s method (an extension of fisher\u2019s\
  \ method) for combining dependent p-values which is appropriate for highly correlated\
  \ data sets found in high-throughput biological experiments."
