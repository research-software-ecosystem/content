description: The package 'girafe' deals with the genome-level representation of aligned
  reads from next-generation sequencing data. It contains an object class for enabling
  a detailed description of genome intervals with aligned reads and functions for
  comparing, visualising, exporting and working with such intervals and the aligned
  reads. As such, the package interacts with and provides a link between the packages
  ShortRead, IRanges and genomeIntervals.
