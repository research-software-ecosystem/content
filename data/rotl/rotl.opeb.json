It was initially developed as part of the NESCENT/OpenTree/Arbor hackathon.\n\nrotl is an R package that can be used to query and download subsets of the synthetic Open Tree of Life directly in R. This repository contains a manuscript describing this package and how to get started with it.\n\nAn interface to the 'Open Tree of Life' API to retrieve phylogenetic trees, information about studies used to assemble the synthetic tree, and utilities to match taxonomic names to 'Open Tree identifiers'. The 'Open Tree of Life' aims at assembling a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for all named species.\n\nThen explore how you can use rotl with other packages to combine your data with trees from the Open Tree of Life project by typing: vignette(\"data_mashups\", package=\"rotl\")","homepage":"https://cran.r-project.org/package=rotl","name":"rotl"}}
