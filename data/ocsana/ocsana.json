However, accumulated empirical experience has shown that targeting multiple proteins in signaling networks involved in the disease is often necessary. Thus, one important problem in biomedical research is the design and prioritization of optimal combinations of interventions to repress a pathological behavior, while minimizing side-effects. OCSANA (optimal combinations of interventions from network analysis) is a new software designed to identify and prioritize optimal and minimal combinations of interventions to disrupt the paths between source nodes and target nodes. When specified by the user, OCSANA seeks to additionally minimize the side effects that a combination of interventions can cause on specified off-target nodes. With the crucial ability to cope with very large networks, OCSANA includes an exact solution and a novel selective enumeration approach for the combinatorial interventions' problem. \u00a9 2012 The Author.", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Vera-Licona P."}, {"name": "Bonnet E."}, {"name": "Barillot E."}, {"name": "Zinovyev A."}], "date": "2013-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bioinfo.curie.fr/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Paola Vera-Licona", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3970-2619", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "paola.vera-licona@curie.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ocsana", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/ocsana/OCSANA.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-01-17T23:03:26Z", "otherID": [], "description": "OCSANA is a new software designed to identify and prioritize optimal and minimal combinations of interventions to disrupt the paths between source nodes and target nodes", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/ocsana-optimal-combinations-interventions-network-analysis.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "ocsana", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:09:51Z", "name": "OCSANA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/ocsana/OCSANA_files/Tutorial.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
