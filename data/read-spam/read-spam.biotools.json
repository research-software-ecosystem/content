                "abstract": "© 2019 Lau et al.Background: In many fields of biomedical research, it is important to estimate phylogenetic distances between taxa based on low-coverage sequencing reads. Major applications are, for example, phylogeny reconstruction, species identification from small sequencing samples, or bacterial strain typing in medical diagnostics. Results: We adapted our previously developed software program Filtered Spaced-Word Matches (FSWM) for alignment-free phylogeny reconstruction to take unassembled reads as input; we call this implementation Read-SpaM. Conclusions: Test runs on simulated reads from semi-artificial and real-world bacterial genomes show that our approach can estimate phylogenetic distances with high accuracy, even for large evolutionary distances and for very low sequencing coverage.",
