Although there are many programs available for this calculation, there are no free-standing, open-source tools designed for easy tool-chain integration. FreeSASA is an open source C library for SASA calculations that provides both command-line and Python interfaces in addition to its C API. The library implements both Lee and Richards' and Shrake and Rupley's approximations, and is highly configurable to allow the user to control molecular parameters, accuracy and output granularity. It only depends on standard C libraries and should therefore be easy to compile and install on any platform. The library is well-documented, stable and efficient. The command-line interface can easily replace closed source legacy programs, with comparable or better accuracy and speed, and with some added functionality.","authors":["Mitternacht S."],"cit_count":21,"doi":"10.12688/f1000research.7931.1","journal":"F1000Research","title":"FreeSASA: An open source C library for solvent accessible surface area calculations","type":"Primary","year":"2016-01-01"},{"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.594175","type":"Other"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:freesasa","biotoolsID":"freesasa","description":"FreeSASA is an open source library and command line tool to calculate the solvent accessible surface areas of protein molecules.
