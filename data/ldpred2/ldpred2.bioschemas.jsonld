You should also probably look at the code of the paper, particularly at the code to prepare summary statistics (including performing the quality control presented in the Methods section “Quality control of summary statistics” of the paper), at the code to read BGEN files into the data format used by bigsnpr, at the code to prepare LD matrices and at the code to run LDpred2 (genome-wide).",
