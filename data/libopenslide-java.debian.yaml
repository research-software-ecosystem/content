  description: java wrapper for reading whole slide image files
  long_description: " OpenSlide is a C library that provides a simple interface to\
    \ read whole-slide\n images also known as virtual slides.\n .\n Whole-slide images,\
    \ also known as virtual slides, are large, high resolution\n images used in digital\
    \ pathology. Reading these images using standard image\n tools or libraries is\
    \ a challenge because these tools are typically designed\n for images that can\
    \ comfortably be uncompressed into RAM or a swap file.\n Whole-slide images routinely\
    \ exceed RAM sizes, often occupying tens of\n gigabytes when uncompressed. Additionally,\
    \ whole-slide images are typically\n multi-resolution, and only a small amount\
    \ of image data might be needed at a\n particular resolution.\n .\n This library\
    \ currently supports:\n  * Trestle (.tif)\n  * Hamamatsu (.vms, .vmu)\n  * Aperio\
    \ (.svs, .tif)\n  * MIRAX (.mrxs)\n  * Generic tiled TIFF (.tif)\n .\n This package\
    \ contains the java module needed to run OpenSlide applications."
