Biologists need infrastructure that easily connects to work that is done in other laboratories, for which standardization is helpful. However, the infrastructure must also accommodate the specifics of their biological system, but appropriate mechanisms to support variation are currently lacking. We argue that a minimal computer language, and a software tool called a generator, can be used to quickly produce customized software infrastructures that 'systems biologists really want to have'. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.","authors":["Swertz M.A.","Jansen R.C."],"cit_count":42,"doi":"10.1038/nrg2048","journal":"Nature Reviews Genetics","pmid":"17297480","title":"Beyond standardization: Dynamic software infrastructures for systems biology","type":"Primary","year":"2007-03-01"},{"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty742","pmcid":"PMC6419911","pmid":"30165396","type":"Primary"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:rd-connect_sample_catalogue","biotoolsID":"rd-connect_sample_catalogue","description":"This catalogue is intended to facilitate the discovery of samples and samples data from Rare Diseases biobanks.\nIt also provides information about sample collections and studies done on the registered samples.","homepage":"https://samples.rd-connect.eu/","name":"RD-Connect Sample Catalogue"}}
