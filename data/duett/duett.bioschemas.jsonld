      "sc:description": "DUETT quantitatively identifies known and novel events in nascent RNA structural dynamics from chemical probing data | MOTIVATION:RNA molecules can undergo complex structural dynamics, especially during transcription, which influence their biological functions. Recently developed high-throughput chemical probing experiments that study RNA cotranscriptional folding generate nucleotide-resolution 'reactivities' for each length of a growing nascent RNA that reflect structural dynamics. However, the manual annotation and qualitative interpretation of reactivity across these large datasets can be nuanced, laborious, and difficult for new practitioners. We developed a quantitative and systematic approach to automatically detect RNA folding events from these datasets to reduce human bias error, standardize event discovery, and generate hypotheses about RNA folding trajectories for further analysis and experimental validation",
