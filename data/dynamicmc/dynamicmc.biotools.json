                "abstract": "The present work introduces an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) computer program called DynamicMC. The present program has the ability to generate ORNL phantom input script for the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) package. The relative dynamic movement of the radiation source with respect to the ORNL phantom can be modeled, which essentially resembles the dynamic movement of source-to-target (i.e., human phantom) distance in a 3-dimensional radiation field. The present program makes the organ-based dosimetry of the human body much easier, as users are not required to write lengthy scripts or deal with any programming that many may find tedious, time consuming, and error prone. In this paper, we have demonstrated that the present program can successfully model simple and complex relative dynamic movements (i.e., those involving rotation of source and human phantom in a 3-dimensional field). The present program would be useful for organ-based dosimetry and could also be used as a tool for teaching nuclear radiation physics and its interaction with the human body.",
