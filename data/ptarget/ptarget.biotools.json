                "abstract": "Motivation: There is a scarcity of efficient computational methods for predicting protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes. Currently available methods are inadequate for genome-scale predictions with several limitations. Here, we present a new prediction method, pTARGET that can predict proteins targeted to nine different subcellular locations in the eukaryotic animal species. Results: The nine subcellular locations predicted by pTARGET include cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular/secretory, golgi, lysosomes, mitochondria, nucleus, plasma membrane and peroxisomes. Predictions are based on the location-specific protein functional domains and the amino acid compositional differences across different subcellular locations. Overall, this method can predict 68-87% of the true positives at accuracy rates of 96-99%. Comparison of the prediction performance against PSORT showed that pTARGET prediction rates are higher by 11-60% in 6 of the 8 locations tested. Besides, the pTARGET method is robust enough for genome-scale prediction of protein subcellular localizations since, it does not rely on the presence of signal or target peptides. \u00a9 The Author 2005.

Predictions are made using a new algorithm [C. Guda and S. Subramaniam (2005) pTARGET [corrected] a new method for predicting protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes. Bioinformatics, 21, 3963-3969], which is primarily based on the occurrence patterns of location-specific protein functional domains in different subcellular locations. We have implemented a relational database, PreCalcDB, to store pre-computed prediction results for all eukaryotic non-plant protein sequences in the public domain that includes about 770 000 entries. Queries can be made by entering protein sequences or by uploading a file containing up to 5000 protein sequences in FASTA format. Prediction results for queries with matching entries in the PreCalcDB will be retrieved instantly; while for the missing ones new predictions will be computed and sent by email. Pre-computed predictions can also be downloaded for complete proteomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens.
