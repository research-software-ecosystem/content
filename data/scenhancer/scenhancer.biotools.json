                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Previous studies on enhancers and their target genes were largely based on bulk samples that represent 'average' regulatory activities from a large population of millions of cells, masking the heterogeneity and important effects from the sub-populations. In recent years, single-cell sequencing technology has enabled the profiling of open chromatin accessibility at the single-cell level (scATAC-seq), which can be used to annotate the enhancers and promoters in specific cell types. A comprehensive resource is highly desirable for exploring how the enhancers regulate the target genes at the single-cell level. Hence, we designed a single-cell database scEnhancer (http://enhanceratlas.net/scenhancer/), covering 14 527 776 enhancers and 63 658 600 enhancer-gene interactions from 1 196 906 single cells across 775 tissue/cell types in three species. An unsupervised learning method was employed to sort and combine tens or hundreds of single cells in each tissue/cell type to obtain the consensus enhancers. In addition, we utilized a cis-regulatory network algorithm to identify the enhancer-gene connections. Finally, we provided a user-friendly platform with seven useful modules to search, visualize, and browse the enhancers/genes. This database will facilitate the research community towards a functional analysis of enhancers at the single-cell level.",
