We propose an efficient method for structure comparison, based on a structural alphabet. Protein Blocks (PBs) is a widely used structural alphabet with 16 pentapeptide conformations that can fairly approximate a complete protein chain. Thus a 3D structure can be translated into a 1D sequence of PBs. With a simple Needleman-Wunsch approach and a raw PB substitution matrix, PB-based structural alignments were better than many popular methods. iPBA web server presents an improved alignment approach using (i) specialized PB Substitution Matrices (SM) and (ii) anchor-based alignment methodology. With these developments, the quality of \u223c88 of alignments was improved. iPBA alignments were also better than DALI, MUSTANG and GANGSTA+ in >80 of the cases. The webserver is designed to for both pairwise comparisons and database searches. Outputs are given as sequence alignment and superposed 3D structures displayed using PyMol and Jmol. A local alignment option for detecting subs-structural similarity is also embedded. As a fast and efficient 'sequence-based' structure comparison tool, we believe that it will be quite useful to the scientific community. iPBA can be accessed at http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb-tools/ipba/. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 52, "authors": [{"name": "Gelly J.-C."}, {"name": "Joseph A.P."}, {"name": "Srinivasan N."}, {"name": "De Brevern A.G."}], "date": "2011-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Agnel Praveen Joseph", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Agnel.Praveen@univ-paris-diderot.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ipba", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/ipba/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein secondary structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2488"}, {"term": "Protein structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2487"}, {"term": "Structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2483"}, {"term": "Protein comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2997"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This tool uses specialized protein block substitution matrices and anchor based methodology for pairwise protein structure comparisons.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl", "Python", "C"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "ipba", "additionDate": "2017-02-14T09:34:21Z", "name": "iPBA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/dsimb_tools/ipba/example.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
