    "description": "summarized.science is an independent, web-based literature monitoring resource that provides monthly curated, topic-focused summaries of recent peer-reviewed scientific research. The platform helps researchers stay up to date with the large volume of publications in their field by offering structured overviews that link directly to primary literature. The summaries are designed to support literature discovery and orientation, not to replace the underlying research papers. The platform includes topic-specific pages covering areas such as bioinformatics and computational biology.",
