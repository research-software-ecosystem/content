The output is a landscape plot that tracks occurrence biases using hypergeometric P-values for all words across the gene ranking. We demonstrated the utility, speed and accuracy of this approach on several datasets.","authors":["van Dongen S.","Abreu-Goodger C.","Enright A.J."],"cit_count":174,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.1267","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Detecting microRNA binding and siRNA off-target effects from expression data","type":"Primary","year":"2008-10-31"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sylamer","biotoolsID":"sylamer","description":"System for finding significantly over or under-represented words in sequences according to a sorted gene list. Typically it is used to find significant enrichment or depletion of microRNA or siRNA seed sequences from microarray expression data. Sylamer is extremely fast and can be applied to genome-wide datasets with ease. Results are plotted in terms of a significance landscape plot. These plots show significance profiles for each word studied across the sorted genelist.","homepage":"http://www-test.ebi.ac.uk/enright/sylamer/","name":"Sylamer","version":["1.0"]}}
