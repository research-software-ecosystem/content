Typically it is used to find significant enrichment or depletion of microRNA or siRNA seed sequences from microarray expression data. Sylamer is extremely fast and can be applied to genome-wide datasets with ease. Results are plotted in terms of a significance landscape plot. These plots show significance profiles for each word studied across the sorted genelist.",
