  "sc:description": "A template-based algorithm for protein domain boundary prediction. Given a protein sequence, ThreaDom first threads the target through the PDB library to identify protein template that have similar structure fold. A domain conservation score (DCS) will be calculated for each residue which combines information from template domain structure, terminal and internal gaps and insertions. Finally, the domain boundary information is derived from the DCS profile distributions.",
