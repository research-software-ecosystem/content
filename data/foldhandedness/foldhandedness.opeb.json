Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Summary: We have created a new server FoldHandedness. Using this server it is possible: (i) to define the regions of helices from two issues (from the PDB file and using the last version of the DSSP program), (ii) to determine the handedness for any chosen three helices and (iii) to calculate the angle and sign between the chosen pairs of the helices for large proteins and complexes of proteins with DNA or RNA. Availability and implementation: The FoldHandedness server is available for users at http://bioinfo.protres.ru/foldhandedness.","authors":["Pereyaslavets L.B.","Glyakina A.V.","Dovidchenko N.V.","Sokolovskiy I.V.","Galzitskaya O.V."],"cit_count":1,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25388147","title":"What handedness and angles between helices has the studied three-helical protein domain?","year":"2015-03-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:foldhandedness","biotoolsID":"foldhandedness","description":"Calculate angles between helices in the set of 3 α-helices from the same chain and the torsion angle (and handedness) of this set of helices.","homepage":"http://bioinfo.protres.ru/foldhandedness/","name":"FoldHandedness"}}
