    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Weakly-Supervised Approach for 3D Hand Shape and Pose Recovery from a Single Depth Image | Hand shape and pose recovery is essential for many computer vision applications such as animation of a personalized hand mesh in a virtual environment. Although there are many hand pose estimation methods, only a few deep learning based algorithms target 3D hand shape and pose from a single RGB or depth image. Jointly estimating hand shape and pose is very challenging because none of the existing real benchmarks provides ground truth hand shape. For this reason, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach for 3D hand shape and pose recovery (named WHSP-Net) from a single depth image by learning shapes from unlabeled real data and labeled synthetic data. To this end, we propose a novel framework which consists of three novel components",
