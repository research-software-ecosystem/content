It includes data generated by sequencing or array-based technologies. Data are submitted by users and imported directly from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. The ArrayExpress Archive is closely integrated with the Gene Expression Atlas and the sequence databases at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Advanced queries provided via ontology enabled interfaces include queries based on technology and sample attributes such as disease, cell types and anatomy. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Parkinson H.","Sarkans U.","Kolesnikov N.","Abeygunawardena N.","Burdett T.","Dylag M.","Emam I.","Farne A.","Hastings E.","Holloway E.","Kurbatova N.","Lukk M.","Malone J.","Mani R.","Pilicheva E.","Rustici G.","Sharma A.","Williams E.","Adamusiak T.","Brandizi M.","Sklyar N.","Brazma A."],"cit_count":241,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21071405","title":"Arrayexpress update-An archive of microarray and high-throughput sequencing-based functional genomics experiments","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:arrayexpress","biotoolsID":"arrayexpress","description":"Public repository of functional genomics data supporting publications.
