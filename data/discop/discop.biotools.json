                "abstract": "© Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.Intrinsically disordered proteins are either entirely disordered or contain disordered regions in their native state. These proteins and regions function without the prerequisite of a stable structure and were found to be abundant across all kingdoms of life. Experimental annotation of disorder lags behind the rapidly growing number of sequenced proteins, motivating the development of computational methods that predict disorder in protein sequences. DisCoP is a user-friendly webserver that provides accurate sequence-based prediction of protein disorder. It relies on meta-architecture in which the outputs generated by multiple disorder predictors are combined together to improve predictive performance. The architecture of disCoP is presented, and its accuracy relative to several other disorder predictors is briefly discussed. We describe usage of the web interface and explain how to access and read results generated by this computational tool. We also provide an example of prediction results and interpretation. The disCoP’s webserver is publicly available at http://biomine.cs.vcu.edu/servers/disCoP/.",
