    "description": "A GPU-Accelerated Machine Learning Framework for Molecular Simulation.\n\n<div> <div> <div> <p>As interest grows in applying machine learning force-fields and methods to molecular simulation, there is a need for state-of-the-art inference methods to use trained models within efficient molecular simulation engines. We have designed and implemented software that enables integration of a scalable GPU-accelerated molecular mechanics engine, HOOMD-blue, with the machine learning (ML) TensorFlow package. TensorFlow is a GPU-accelerated, scalable, graph-based tensor computation model building package that has been the implementation of many recent innovations in deep learning and other ML tasks. TensorFlow models are constructed in Python and can be visualized or debugged using the rich set of tools implemented in the TensorFlow package.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ML', 'GPU-Accelerated Machine Learning Framework Molecular Simulation', 'div', 'div div'",
