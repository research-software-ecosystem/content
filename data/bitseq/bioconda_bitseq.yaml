description: The BitSeq package is targeted for transcript expression analysis and
  differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data in two stage process. In the first
  stage it uses Bayesian inference methodology to infer expression of individual transcripts
  from individual RNA-seq experiments. The second stage of BitSeq embraces the differential
  expression analysis of transcript expression. Providing expression estimates from
  replicates of multiple conditions, Log-Normal model of the estimates is used for
  inferring the condition mean transcript expression and ranking the transcripts based
  on the likelihood of differential expression.
