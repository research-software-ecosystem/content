It provides different semantic similarity measures for Gene Ontology terms and offers functional similarity values for proteins contained in UniProtKB and for protein families/domains in Pfam and SMART. Users can perform semantic similarity searches with GO terms and functional similarity searches with proteins or protein families. It also supports prioritizing disease gene candidates.",

The Functional Similarity Matrix (FunSimMat, http://www.funsimmat.de) is a comprehensive database providing various precomputed functional similarity values for proteins in UniProtKB and for protein families in Pfam and SMART. With this update, we significantly increase the coverage of FunSimMat by adding data from the Gene Ontology Annotation project as well as new functional similarity measures. The applicability of the database is greatly extended by the implementation of a new Gene Ontology-based method for disease gene prioritization. Two new visualization tools allow an interactive analysis of the functional relationships between proteins or protein families. This is enhanced further by the introduction of an automatically derived hierarchy of annotation classes. Additional changes include a revised user front-end and a new RESTlike interface for improving the user-friendliness and online accessibility of FunSimMat. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2009.
