In this work, a new computational predictor was developed for NCSP prediction of gram-positive bacteria. The subset-specific optimal feature combination process was adopted to characterize the original data from different aspects, and all subdataset based models were integrated into a unified model NonClasGP-Pred, which achieved an excellent performance and outperformed state-of-the-art available toolkits.\n\nPrediction of non-classically secreted proteins of Gram-positive bacteria.",
