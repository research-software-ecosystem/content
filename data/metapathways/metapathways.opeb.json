Published by Oxford University Press.Next-generation sequencing is producing vast amounts of sequence information from natural and engineered ecosystems. Although this data deluge has an enormous potential to transform our lives, knowledge creation and translation need software applications that scale with increasing data processing and analysis requirements. Here, we present improvements to MetaPathways, an annotation and analysis pipeline for environmental sequence information that expedites this transformation. We specifically address pathway prediction hazards through integration of a weighted taxonomic distance and enable quantitative comparison of assembled annotations through a normalized read-mapping measure. Additionally, we improve LAST homology searches through BLAST-equivalent E-values and output formats that are natively compatible with prevailing software applications. Finally, an updated graphical user interface allows for keyword annotation query and projection onto user-defined functional gene hierarchies, including the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme database.","authors":["Konwar K.M.","Hanson N.W.","Bhatia M.P.","Kim D.","Wu S.-J.","Hahn A.S.","Morgan-Lang C.","Cheung H.K.","Hallam S.J."],"cit_count":20,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"26076725","title":"MetaPathways v2.5: Quantitative functional, taxonomic and usability improvements","year":"2015-03-25"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metapathways","biotoolsID":"metapathways","description":"Modular software pipeline for integrated analysis of environmental sequence information.
