Novel cancer target proteins have been identified and many compounds that activate or inhibit cancer-relevant target genes have been developed. This knowledge is based on an immense number of experimentally validated compound-target interactions in the literature, and excerpts from literature text mining are spread over numerous data sources. Our own analysis shows that the overlap between important existing repositories such as Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base (PharmGKB) and DrugBank as well as between our own literature mining for cancer-annotated entries is surprisingly small. In order to provide an easy overview of interaction data, it is essential to integrate this information into a single, comprehensive data repository. Here, we present CancerResource, a database that integrates cancer-relevant relationships of compounds and targets from (i) our own literature mining and (ii) external resources complemented with (iii) essential experimental and supporting information on genes and cellular effects. In order to facilitate an overview of existing and supporting information, a series of novel information connections have been established. CancerResource addresses the spectrum of research on compound-target interactions in natural sciences as well as in individualized medicine; CancerResource is available at: http:// bioinformatics.charite.de/cancerresource/. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Ahmed J.","Meinel T.","Dunkel M.","Murgueitio M.S.","Adams R.","Blasse C.","Eckert A.","Preissner S.","Preissner R."],"cit_count":57,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"20952398","title":"CancerResource: A comprehensive database of cancer-relevant proteins and compound interactions supported by experimental knowledge","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cancerresource","biotoolsID":"cancerresource","description":"CancerResource, a database that integrates cancer-relevant relationships of compounds and targets from (i) literature mining and (ii) external resources complemented with (iii) essential experimental and supporting information on genes and cellular effects.
