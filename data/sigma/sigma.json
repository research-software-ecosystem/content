Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Metagenomic sequencing of clinical samples provides a promising technique for direct pathogen detection and characterization in biosurveillance. Taxonomic analysis at the strain level can be used to resolve serotypes of a pathogen in biosurveillance. Sigma was developed for strain-level identification and quantification of pathogens using their reference genomes based on metagenomic analysis. Results: Sigma provides not only accurate strain-level inferences, but also three unique capabilities: (i) Sigma quantifies the statistical uncertainty of its inferences, which includes hypothesis testing of identified genomes and confidence interval estimation of their relative abundances; (ii) Sigma enables strain variant calling by assigning metagenomic reads to their most likely reference genomes; and (iii) Sigma supports parallel computing for fast analysis of large datasets. The algorithm performance was evaluated using simulated mock communities and fecal samples with spike-in pathogen strains.", "citationCount": 24, "authors": [{"name": "Ahn T.-H."}, {"name": "Chai J."}, {"name": "Pan C."}], "date": "2015-01-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.omicsbio.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "cpan@utk.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "panc@ornl.gov"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sigma", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sigma.omicsbio.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression profiling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0314"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A novel sequence similarity-based approach for strain-level identification of genomes from metagenomic analysis for biosurveillance.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/sigma-1-0-1-strain-level-identification-of-genomes-from-metagenomic-analysis-for-biosurveillance.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "sigma", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:59:36Z", "name": "SIGMA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://sigma.omicsbio.org/instructions-5/", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
