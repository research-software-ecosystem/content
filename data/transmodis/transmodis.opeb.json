The development of tools for identifying direct target genes of transcription factors (TFs) is critical to this endeavor. Given a set of microscopy experiments, a probabilistics model called TRANSMODIS has been developed which can infer the direct targets of a TF by integrating sequence motif, gene expression and ChIP-chip data. The performance of TRANSMODIS was first validated on a set of transcription factor perturbation experiments (TFPEs) involving Pho4p, a well studied TF in Sacchoromyces cerevisiae. TRANSMODIS removed elements of arbitrarines in manual target gene selection process and produced results that concur with one's intuition. TRANSMODIS was further validated on a genome-wide scale by comparing it with two other methods in Sacchoromyces cerevisiae. The usefulness of TRANSMODIS was then demonstrated by applying it to the identification of direct targets of DAF-16, a critical TF regulating ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that 189 genes were tightly regulated by DAF-16. In addition, DAF-16 has differential preference for motifs when acting as an activator or repressor, which awaits experimental verification. TRANSMODIS is computationally efficient and robust, making it a useful probabilistics framework for finding immediate targets. © 2008 Yu et al.","authors":["Yu R.X.","Liu J.","True N.","Wang W."],"cit_count":7,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0001821","journal":"PLoS ONE","title":"Identification of direct target genes using joint sequence and expression likelihood with application to DAF-16","type":"Primary","year":"2008-03-19"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:transmodis","biotoolsID":"transmodis","description":"Generalization of MODEM to consider sequence motif and multiple gene expression or ChIP-binding experiments to identify TF binding sites.","homepage":"http://wanglab.ucsd.edu/star/download.php","name":"TransModis"}}
