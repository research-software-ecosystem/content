The development of tools for identifying direct target genes of transcription factors (TFs) is critical to this endeavor. Given a set of microscopy experiments, a probabilistics model called TRANSMODIS has been developed which can infer the direct targets of a TF by integrating sequence motif, gene expression and ChIP-chip data. The performance of TRANSMODIS was first validated on a set of transcription factor perturbation experiments (TFPEs) involving Pho4p, a well studied TF in Sacchoromyces cerevisiae. TRANSMODIS removed elements of arbitrarines in manual target gene selection process and produced results that concur with one's intuition. TRANSMODIS was further validated on a genome-wide scale by comparing it with two other methods in Sacchoromyces cerevisiae. The usefulness of TRANSMODIS was then demonstrated by applying it to the identification of direct targets of DAF-16, a critical TF regulating ageing in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that 189 genes were tightly regulated by DAF-16. In addition, DAF-16 has differential preference for motifs when acting as an activator or repressor, which awaits experimental verification. TRANSMODIS is computationally efficient and robust, making it a useful probabilistics framework for finding immediate targets. \u00a9 2008 Yu et al.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Yu R.X."}, {"name": "Liu J."}, {"name": "True N."}, {"name": "Wang W."}], "date": "2008-03-19T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://wanglab.ucsd.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:transmodis", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://wanglab.ucsd.edu/star/download.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Microarray data analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Generalization of MODEM to consider sequence motif and multiple gene expression or ChIP-binding experiments to identify TF binding sites.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/transmodis-sequence-motif-gene-expression-chip-binding-data-identify-tf-binding-sites.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "transmodis", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:13:48Z", "name": "TransModis", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
