      "sc:description": "Developed for aligning genomic sequences and uses bit-level operations. It is efficient in terms of both time and space for aligning two very long genomic sequences and for identifying genomic rearrangements. It is suitable for aligning fairly divergent sequences. It consists of several efficient components: bit-level coding, search for matching segments between the two sequences as alignment anchors, longest increasing subsequence (LIS), and optimal local alignment.",
