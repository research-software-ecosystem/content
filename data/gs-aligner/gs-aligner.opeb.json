GS-Aligner is efficient in terms of both time and space for aligning two very long genomic sequences and for identifying genomic rearrangements such as translocations and inversions. It is suitable for aligning fairly divergent sequences such as human and mouse genomic sequences. It consists of several efficient components: bit-level coding, search for matching segments between the two sequences as alignment anchors, longest increasing subsequence (LIS), and optimal local alignment. Efforts have been made to reduce the execution time of the program to make it truly practical for aligning very long sequences. Empirical tests suggest that for relatively divergent sequences such as sequences from different mammalian orders or from a mammal and a nonmammalian vertebrate GS-Aligner performs better than existing methods. The program and data can be downloaded from http://pondside.uchicago.edu/~lilab/ and http://webcollab.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~biocom.","authors":["Shih A.C.-C.","Li W.-H."],"cit_count":6,"doi":"10.1093/molbev/msg139","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","title":"GS-Aligner: A novel tool for aligning genomic sequences using bit-level operations","type":"Primary","year":"2003-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gs-aligner","biotoolsID":"gs-aligner","description":"Developed for aligning genomic sequences and uses bit-level operations.
