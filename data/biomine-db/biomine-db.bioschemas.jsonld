      "sc:description": "A database for metazoan biomineralization proteins.\n\nBiomineralization is the process by which living organisms construct hard skeletons creating complex structures that range from specialized tissues such as bone or teeth to ecosystems such as coral reefs. Biominerals are composed of both inorganic minerals and proteins, which give them extra hardness and special attributes. Biomineralization proteins are also known to be associated with multiple bone disorders and are therefore of biomedical importance. Herein we describe BioMine-DB, a biomineralization centric protein database. Availability and implementation: BioMine-DB can be accessed at http: biomine.net, SQL dump, FASTA files and source code are available for download as well at https: github.com bishoyh biomineDB \"",
