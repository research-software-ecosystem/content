We developed a web-based application called Cistrome, based on the Galaxy open source framework. In addition to the standard Galaxy functions, Cistrome has 29 ChIP-chip- and ChIP-seq-specific tools in three major categories, from preliminary peak calling and correlation analyses to downstream genome feature association, gene expression analyses, and motif discovery. © 2011 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Liu T.","Ortiz J.A.","Taing L.","Meyer C.A.","Lee B.","Zhang Y.","Shin H.","Wong S.S.","Ma J.","Lei Y.","Pape U.J.","Poidinger M.","Chen Y.","Yeung K.","Brown M.","Turpaz Y.","Liu X.S."],"cit_count":293,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"21859476","title":"Cistrome: An integrative platform for transcriptional regulation studies","year":"2011-08-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cistrome","biotoolsID":"cistrome","description":"A web-based application with an analysis platform for CHIP-chip/seq and gene expression microarray data.","homepage":"http://www.cistrome.org/Cistrome/Cistrome_Project.html#","name":"Cistrome"}}
