Motivation: Signal transduction via calcium ions (Ca2+) represents a fundamental signaling pathway in all eukaryotic cells. A large portion of the human genome encodes proteins used to assemble signaling systems that can transduce signals with diverse spatial and temporal dynamics. Results: Here, we provide a map of all of the genes involved in Ca2+ signaling and link these genes to human genetic disorders. Using Gene Ontology terms and genome databases, 1805 genes were identified as regulators or targets of intracellular Ca2+ signals. Associating these 1805 genes with human genetic disorders uncovered 1470 diseases with mutated 'Ca2+ genes'. A network with scale-free properties appeared when the Ca2+ genes were mapped to their associated genetic disorders. Availability and Implementation: The Ca2+ genome database is freely available at http://cagedb.uhlenlab.org and will foster studies of gene functions and genetic disorders associated with Ca2+ signaling.
