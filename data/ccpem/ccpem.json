The aims of the project are threefold: to build a coherent cryoEM community which will provide support for individual scientists and will act as a focal point for liaising with other communities, to support practising scientists in their use of cryoEM software and finally to support software developers in producing and disseminating robust and user-friendly programs. The project is closely modelled on CCP4 for macromolecular crystallography, and areas of common interest such as model fitting, underlying software libraries and tools for building program packages are being exploited. Nevertheless, cryoEM includes a number of techniques covering a large range of resolutions and a distinct project is required. In this article, progress so far is reported and future plans are discussed.", "citationCount": 21, "authors": [{"name": "Wood C."}, {"name": "Burnley T."}, {"name": "Patwardhan A."}, {"name": "Scheres S."}, {"name": "Topf M."}, {"name": "Roseman A."}, {"name": "Winn M."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography"}}, {"doi": "10.1107/S2059798317007859", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Primary", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Recent developments in the CCP-EM software suite", "abstract": "\u00a9 2017 Burnley et al.As part of its remit to provide computational support to the cryo-EM community, the Collaborative Computational Project for Electron cryo-Microscopy (CCP-EM) has produced a software framework which enables easy access to a range of programs and utilities. The resulting software suite incorporates contributions from different collaborators by encapsulating them in Python task wrappers, which are then made accessible via a user-friendly graphical user interface as well as a command-line interface suitable for scripting. The framework includes tools for project and data management. An overview of the design of the framework is given, together with a survey of the functionality at different levels. The current CCP-EM suite has particular strength in the building and refinement of atomic models into cryo-EM reconstructions, which is described in detail.An overview is given of the new CCP-EM software suite, including the underpinning framework, the current functionality and the distribution procedure. This first version of the suite has a focus on building and refining atomic models.", "citationCount": 28, "authors": [{"name": "Burnley T."}, {"name": "Palmer C.M."}, {"name": "Winn M."}], "date": "2017-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Acta Crystallographica Section D: Structural Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "Instruct", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "CCP-EM Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ccpem@stfc.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ccpem", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ccpem.ac.uk", "function": [{"note": "CCP for biological cryoEM", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Electron microscopy volume map", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0940"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Protein modelling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0477"}, {"term": "Single particle alignment and classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3458"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Structure", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0883"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-10-16T13:43:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Collaborative Computational Project for Electron cryo-Microscopy", "toolType": ["Workbench"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "ccpem", "additionDate": "2015-03-26T22:38:49Z", "name": "CCPEM", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.ccpem.ac.uk/docs.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
