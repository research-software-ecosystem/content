    "description": "OligoCalc calculates the physical properties of single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA molecules including melting temperature (multiple methods), concentration, molecular weight, and absorbance at 260 nanometers.  OligoCalc can also account for 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 chemical modifications and predict potential hairpin loop formation.",

OligoCalc has a familiar 'calculator' look and feel, making it readily understandable and usable. OligoCalc incorporates three common methods for calculating oligonucleotide- melting temperatures, including a nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model for melting temperature. Since it first came online in 1997, there have been more than 900 000 accesses of OligoCalc from nearly 200 000 distinct hosts, excluding search engines. OligoCalc is available at http://basic.north western.edu/biotools/OligoCalc.html, with links to the full source code, usage patterns and statistics at that link as well. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).",
