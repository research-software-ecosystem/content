It is associated with a wide spectrum of human diseases. In the last two decades, tremendous efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanism of hundreds of immunosuppression genes. Immunosuppression genes could be valuable drug targets or biomarkers for the immunotherapeutic treatment of different diseases. However, the information of all previously identified immunosuppression genes is dispersed in thousands of publications. Here, we provide the HisgAtlas database that collects 995 previously identified human immunosuppression genes using text mining and manual curation. We believe HisgAtlas will be a valuable resource to search human immunosuppression genes as well as to investigate their functions in further research.
