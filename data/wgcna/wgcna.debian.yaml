description: "Functions necessary to perform Weighted Correlation Network Analysis\
  \ on high-dimensional data as originally described in Horvath and Zhang (2005) <doi:10.2202/1544-6115.1128>\
  \ and Langfelder and Horvath (2008) <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-9-559>. Includes functions\
  \ for rudimentary data cleaning, construction of correlation networks, module identification,\
  \ summarization, and relating of variables and modules to sample traits. Also includes\
  \ a number of utility functions for data manipulation and visualization.\n"
