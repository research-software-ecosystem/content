This program was written using Python programming language and the calculation of buildup factors was based on the well-known Geometric Progression (GP) fitting procedure. The equivalent atomic numbers and GP fitting parameters of mixtures and compounds can also be evaluated using this program","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31360782","name":"EXABCal"}}
