      "sc:description": "Construction of complete Tupaia belangeri transcriptome database by whole-genome and comprehensive RNA sequencing | Tupaia belangeri (Family Tupaia, Genus Tupaia) | Tupaia ( Tupaia belangeri ) is a small mammal belonging to the family Tupaiidae, which consists of four genera and 19 extant species. The members of the genus Tupaia , which are colloquially referred to as the tree shrews, were first recorded in a sketch by William Ellis on a voyage with Captain Cook in 1780. Tree shrews are similar in appearance to squirrels, and their body weight ranges between 120-200 g. The natural habitat of the tree shrews consists of the tropical rainforests in South East Asia, where they feed on fruits, insects, and small vertebrates",
