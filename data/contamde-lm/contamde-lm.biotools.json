All rights reserved.Motivation: Tumor and adjacent normal RNA samples are commonly used to screen differentially expressed genes between normal and tumor samples or among tumor subtypes. Such paired-sample design could avoid numerous confounders in differential expression (DE) analysis, but the cellular contamination of tumor samples can be an important noise and confounding factor, which can both inflate false-positive rate and deflate true-positive rate. The existing DE tools that use next-generation RNA-seq data either do not account for cellular contamination or are computationally extensive with increasingly large sample size. Results: A novel linear model was proposed to avoid the problem that could arise from tumor normal correlation for paired samples. A statistically robust and computationally very fast DE analysis procedure, contamDE-lm, was developed based on the novel model to account for cellular contamination, boosting DE analysis power through the reduction in individual residual variances using gene-wise information. The desired advantages of contamDE-lm over some state-of-The-Art methods (limma and DESeq2) were evaluated through the applications to simulated data, TCGA database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database.",
