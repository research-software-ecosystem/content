description: This package implements five methods proposed by Resnik, Schlicker, Jiang,
  Lin and Wang respectively for measuring semantic similarities among DO terms and
  gene products. Enrichment analyses including hypergeometric model and gene set enrichment
  analysis are also implemented for discovering disease associations of high-throughput
  biological data.
