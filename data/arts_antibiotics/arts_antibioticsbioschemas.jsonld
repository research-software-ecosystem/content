Automate the screening of large amounts of sequence data and to focus on the most promising strains that produce antibiotics with new modes of action. It integrates target directed genome mining methods, antibiotic gene cluster predictions and ‘essential gene screening’ to provide an interactive page for rapid identification of known and putative targets in BGCs.",
