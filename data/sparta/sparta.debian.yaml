summary: automated reference-based bacterial RNA-seq Transcriptome Analysis
description: >
   SPARTA is a workflow aimed at analyzing single-end Illumina RNA-seq
   data. The workflow combines several tools: Trimmomatic (read
   trimming/adapter removal), FastQC (read quality analysis), Bowtie
   (mapping reads to the reference genome), HTSeq (transcript/gene feature
   abundance counting), and edgeR (differential gene expression analysis).
   Within the differential gene expression analysis step, batch effects can
   be detected and the user is warned of the potential, unintended
   additional variable. The analysis procedure is outlined below.
