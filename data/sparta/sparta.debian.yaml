  description: automated reference-based bacterial RNA-seq Transcriptome Analysis
  long_description: " SPARTA is a workflow aimed at analyzing single-end Illumina\
    \ RNA-seq\n data. The workflow combines several tools: Trimmomatic (read\n trimming/adapter\
    \ removal), FastQC (read quality analysis), Bowtie\n (mapping reads to the reference\
    \ genome), HTSeq (transcript/gene feature\n abundance counting), and edgeR (differential\
    \ gene expression analysis).\n Within the differential gene expression analysis\
    \ step, batch effects can\n be detected and the user is warned of the potential,\
    \ unintended\n additional variable. The analysis procedure is outlined below."
