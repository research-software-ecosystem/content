  "sc:description": "Annokey is a command line tool for annotating gene lists with the results of a key-term search of the NCBI Gene database and linked PubMed article abstracts. Its purpose is to help users prioritise genes by relevance to a domain of interest, such as “breast cancer” or “DNA repair” etcetera. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords and terms that are likely to be highly correlated with their domain of interest.",
