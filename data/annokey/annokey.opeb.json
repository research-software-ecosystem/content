Its purpose is to help users prioritise genes by relevance to a domain of interest, such as “breast cancer” or “DNA repair” etcetera. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords and terms that are likely to be highly correlated with their domain of interest.","homepage":"http://bjpop.github.io/annokey/","name":"Annokey"}}
