    "description": "A method for merging multiple independent neuronal traces.\n\nBACKGROUND:The ability to reconstruct neuronal networks, local microcircuits, or the entire connectome is a central goal of modern neuroscience. Recently, advancements in sample preparation (e.g., sample expansion and Brainbow labeling) and optical (e.g., confocal and light sheet) techniques have enabled the imaging of increasingly large neural systems with high contrast. Tracing neuronal structures from these images proves challenging, however, necessitating tools that integrate multiple neuronal traces, potentially derived by various methods, into one combined (montaged) result. NEW METHOD:Here, we present TraceMontage, an ImageJ Fiji plugin for the combination of multiple neuron traces of a single image, either redundantly or non-redundantly.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'tracing', 'CONCLUSIONS:TraceMontage'",
