about:
  description: Package to predict protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks in target
    organisms for which only a view information about PPIs is available. Path2PPI
    predicts PPI networks based on sets of proteins which can belong to a certain
    pathway from well-established model organisms. It helps to combine and transfer
    information of a certain pathway or biological process from several reference
    organisms to one target organism. Path2PPI only depends on the sequence similarity
    of the involved proteins.
