                "abstract": "LOCtarget is a web server and database that predicts and annotates sub-cellular localization for structural genomics targets; LOCnet is one of the methods used in LOCtarget that can predict sub-cellular localization for all eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins. Targets are taken from the central registration database for structural genomics, namely, TargetDB. LOCtarget predicts localization through a combination of four different methods: known nuclear localization signals (PredictNLS), homology-based transfer of experimental annotations (LOChom), inference through automatic text analysis of SWISS-PROT keywords (LOCkey) and de novo prediction through a system of neural networks (LOCnet). Additionally, we report predictions from SignalP. The final prediction is based on the method with the highest confidence. The web server can be used to predict sub-cellular localization of proteins from their amino acid sequence. The LOCtarget database currently contains localization predictions for all eukaryotic proteins from TargetDB and is updated every week. The server is available at http://www.rostlab.org/services/LOCtarget/. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
