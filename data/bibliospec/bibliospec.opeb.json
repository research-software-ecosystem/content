Library searching provides a quick method for making peptide-spectrum matches by comparing a query spectrum to a collection of reference spectra of known peptide sequence. Pre-assembled libraries for several model organisms can be used as the basis of a search or custom libraries can easily be assembled. The protocols in this unit describe installing BiblioSpec, searching libraries, and creating custom libraries.
