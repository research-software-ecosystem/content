                "abstract": "Microbial communities influence host phenotypes through microbiota-derived metabolites and interactions between exogenous active substances (EASs) and the microbiota. Owing to the high dynamics of microbial community composition and difficulty in microbial functional analysis, the identification of mechanistic links between individual microbes and host phenotypes is complex. Thus, it is important to characterize variations in microbial composition across various conditions (for example, topographical locations, times, physiological and pathological conditions, and populations of different ethnicities) in microbiome studies. However, no web server is currently available to facilitate such characterization. Moreover, accurately annotating the functions of microbes and investigating the possible factors that shape microbial function are critical for discovering links between microbes and host phenotypes. Herein, an online tool, CDEMI, is introduced to discover microbial composition variations across different conditions, and five types of microbe libraries are provided to comprehensively characterize the functionality of microbes from different perspectives. These collective microbe libraries include (1) microbial functional pathways, (2) disease associations with microbes, (3) EASs associations with microbes, (4) bioactive microbial metabolites, and (5) human body habitats. In summary, CDEMI is unique in that it can reveal microbial patterns in distributions/compositions across different conditions and facilitate biological interpretations based on diverse microbe libraries. CDEMI is accessible at http://rdblab.cn/cdemi/",
