Now includes both a UKPMC and PubMed search, as well as access to other records such as Agricola, Patents and recent biomedical theses. Furthermore, UKPMC contains 'Cited By' information as an alternative way to navigate the literature and has incorporated text-mining approaches to semantically enrich content and integrate it with related database resources.",
