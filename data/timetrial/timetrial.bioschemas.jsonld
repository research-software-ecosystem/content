Consisting of two interactive applications using both synthetic and biological data, TimeTrial allows researchers to explore the effects of experimental design on signal shape, examine cycling detection reproducibility across biological datasets, and optimize experimental design for cycle detection. TimeTrial is currently in beta.",
