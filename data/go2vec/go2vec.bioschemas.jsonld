      "sc:description": "transforming GO terms and proteins to vector representations via graph embeddings.\n\nBACKGROUND:Semantic similarity between Gene Ontology (GO) terms is a fundamental measure for many bioinformatics applications, such as determining functional similarity between genes or proteins. Most previous research exploited information content to estimate the semantic similarity between GO terms; recently some research exploited word embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from a large-scale corpus. In this paper, we proposed a novel method, named GO2Vec, that exploits graph embeddings to learn vector representations for GO terms from GO graph. GO2Vec combines the information from both GO graph and GO annotations, and its learned vectors can be applied to a variety of bioinformatics applications, such as calculating functional similarity between proteins and predicting protein-protein interactions",
