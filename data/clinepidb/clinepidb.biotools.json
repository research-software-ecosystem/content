    "description": "An open-access clinical epidemiology database resource encouraging online exploration of complex studies.\n\nThe concept of open data has been gaining traction as a mechanism to increase data use, ensure that data are preserved over time, and accelerate discovery. While epidemiology data sets are increasingly deposited in databases and repositories, barriers to access still remain. ClinEpiDB was constructed as an open-access online resource for clinical and epidemiologic studies by leveraging the extensive web toolkit and infrastructure of the Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resources (EuPathDB; a collection of databases covering 170+ eukaryotic pathogens, relevant related species, and select hosts) combined with a unified semantic web framework. Here we present an intuitive point-and-click website that allows users to visualize and subset data directly in the ClinEpiDB browser and immediately explore potential associations",
