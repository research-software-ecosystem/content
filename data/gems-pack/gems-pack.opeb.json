Since Packmol is largely used by the molecular simulation community, this work provides a complement to it, in the form of a user-friendly and efficient interface. A tool for number volume density calculation is provided to make needed calculations faster. Also, a visualization utility is included, which lets the users preview how their systems will look like even before running the packing procedure. This application does not modify the original Packmol code; it works in a complementary way, by generating the input script and running it through the system's terminal. This program is part of a development project and is intended to be further extended. Two examples are described in this paper to illustrate GEMS-Pack usage.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Packmol'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31633924","name":"GEMS-Pack"}}
