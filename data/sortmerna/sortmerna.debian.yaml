description: SortMeRNA is a biological sequence analysis tool for filtering, mapping
  and OTU-picking NGS reads. The core algorithm is based on approximate seeds and
  allows for fast and sensitive analyses of nucleotide sequences. The main application
  of SortMeRNA is filtering rRNA from metatranscriptomic data. Additional applications
  include OTU-picking and taxonomy assignation available through QIIME v1.9+ (http://qiime.org
  - v1.9.0-rc1). SortMeRNA takes as input a file of reads (fasta or fastq format)
  and one or multiple rRNA database file(s), and sorts apart rRNA and rejected reads
  into two files specified by the user. Optionally, it can provide high quality local
  alignments of rRNA reads against the rRNA database. SortMeRNA works with Illumina,
  454, Ion Torrent and PacBio data, and can produce SAM and BLAST-like alignments.
