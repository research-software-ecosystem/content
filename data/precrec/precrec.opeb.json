Published by Oxford University Press.The precision-recall plot is more informative than the ROC plot when evaluating classifiers on imbalanced datasets, but fast and accurate curve calculation tools for precision-recall plots are currently not available. We have developed Precrec, an R library that aims to overcome this limitation of the plot. Our tool provides fast and accurate precision-recall calculations together with multiple functionalities that work efficiently under different conditions.","authors":["Saito T.","Rehmsmeier M."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw570","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Precrec: Fast and accurate precision-recall and ROC curve calculations in R","type":"Primary","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:precrec","biotoolsID":"precrec","description":"Integrated platform that enables robust performance evaluations of binary classifiers in R.
