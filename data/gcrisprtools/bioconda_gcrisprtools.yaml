description: Set of tools for evaluating pooled high-throughput screening experiments,
  typically employing CRISPR/Cas9 or shRNA expression cassettes. Contains methods
  for interrogating library and cassette behavior within an experiment, identifying
  differentially abundant cassettes, aggregating signals to identify candidate targets
  for empirical validation, hypothesis testing, and comprehensive reporting.
