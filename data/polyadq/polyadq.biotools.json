To avoid training on possibly flawed data, the development of polyadq began with a de novo characterization of human mRNA 3' processing signals. This information was used in training two quadratic discriminant functions that polyadq uses to evaluate potential polyA signals. In our tests, polyadq predicts polyA signals with a correlation coefficient of 0.413 on whole genes and 0.512 in the last two exons of genes, substantially outperforming other published programs on the same data set. polyadq is also the only program that is able to consistently detect the ATTAAA variant of the polyA signal.",
