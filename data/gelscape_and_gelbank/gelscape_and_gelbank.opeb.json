It uses Java applet-servlet technology to allow rapid, remote image handling and image processing in a platform-independent manner. It supports many of the features found in commercial, stand-alone gel analysis software including spot annotation, spot integration, gel warping, image resizing, HTML image mapping, image overlaying as well as the storage of gel image and gel annotation data in compliance with Federated Gel Database requirements. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Young N.","Chang Z.","Wishart D.S."],"cit_count":15,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"14764570","title":"GelScape: A web-based server for interactively annotating, manipulating, comparing and archiving 1D and 2D gel images","year":"2004-04-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gelscape_and_gelbank","biotoolsID":"gelscape_and_gelbank","description":"Platform-independent 1D and 2D gel analysis system that is freely available.
