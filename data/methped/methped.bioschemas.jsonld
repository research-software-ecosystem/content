      "sc:description": "Classification of pediatric tumors into biologically defined subtypes is challenging and multifaceted approaches are needed. We developed a diagnostic classifier based on DNA methylation profiles. This tool is a toolbox that allows researchers and clinical diagnosticians to test single samples as well as large cohorts for subclass prediction of pediatric brain tumors. The current version can classify the following: DIPG, Ependymoma, ETMR, GBM, MB3 and 4, MB_WNT, MB_SHH, and PiloAstro.",
