  description: converts proteins to genomic DNA alignment
  long_description: " PAL2NAL is a program that converts a multiple sequence alignment\n\
    \ of proteins and the corresponding DNA (or mRNA) sequences into\n a codon-based\
    \ DNA alignment. The program automatically assigns\n the corresponding codon sequence\
    \ even if the input DNA sequence\n has mismatches with the input protein sequence,\
    \ or contains UTRs,\n polyA tails. It can also deal with frame shifts in the input\n\
    \ alignment, which is suitable for the analysis of pseudogenes.\n The resulting\
    \ codon-based DNA alignment can further be subjected\n to the calculation of synonymous\
    \ (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka)\n substitution rates.\n"
