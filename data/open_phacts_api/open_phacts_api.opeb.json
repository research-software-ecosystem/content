In this application report, we describe a linked data platform for integrating multiple pharmacology datasets that form the basis for several drug discovery applications. The functionality offered by the platform has been drawn from a collection of prioritised drug discovery business questions created as part of the Open PHACTS project, a collaboration of research institutions and major pharmaceutical companies. We describe the architecture of the platform focusing on seven design decisions that drove its development with the aim of informing others developing similar software in this or other domains. The utility of the platform is demonstrated by the variety of drug discovery applications being built to access the integrated data. An alpha version of the OPS platform is currently available to the Open PHACTS consortium and a first public release will be made in late 2012, see http://www.openphacts.org/ for details. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.","authors":["Gray A.J.G.","Groth P.","Loizou A.","Askjaer S.","Brenninkmeijer C.","Burger K.","Chichester C.","Evelo C.T.","Goble C.","Harland L.","Pettifer S.","Thompson M.","Waagmeester A.","Williams A.J."],"cit_count":33,"doi":"10.3233/SW-2012-0088","journal":"Semantic Web","title":"Applying linked data approaches to pharmacology: Architectural decisions and implementation","type":"Primary","year":"2014-01-01"},{"abstract":"Open PHACTS is a public-private partnership between academia, publishers, small and medium sized enterprises and pharmaceutical companies. The goal of the project is to deliver and sustain an 'open pharmacological space' using and enhancing state-of-the-art semantic web standards and technologies. It is focused on practical and robust applications to solve specific questions in drug discovery research. OPS is intended to facilitate improvements in drug discovery in academia and industry and to support open innovation and in-house non-public drug discovery research.
