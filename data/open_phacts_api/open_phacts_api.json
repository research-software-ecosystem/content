In this application report, we describe a linked data platform for integrating multiple pharmacology datasets that form the basis for several drug discovery applications. The functionality offered by the platform has been drawn from a collection of prioritised drug discovery business questions created as part of the Open PHACTS project, a collaboration of research institutions and major pharmaceutical companies. We describe the architecture of the platform focusing on seven design decisions that drove its development with the aim of informing others developing similar software in this or other domains. The utility of the platform is demonstrated by the variety of drug discovery applications being built to access the integrated data. An alpha version of the OPS platform is currently available to the Open PHACTS consortium and a first public release will be made in late 2012, see http://www.openphacts.org/ for details. \u00a9 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.", "citationCount": 33, "authors": [{"name": "Gray A.J.G."}, {"name": "Groth P."}, {"name": "Loizou A."}, {"name": "Askjaer S."}, {"name": "Brenninkmeijer C."}, {"name": "Burger K."}, {"name": "Chichester C."}, {"name": "Evelo C.T."}, {"name": "Goble C."}, {"name": "Harland L."}, {"name": "Pettifer S."}, {"name": "Thompson M."}, {"name": "Waagmeester A."}, {"name": "Williams A.J."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Semantic Web"}}, {"doi": "10.1016/j.drudis.2012.05.016", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Open PHACTS: Semantic interoperability for drug discovery", "abstract": "Open PHACTS is a public-private partnership between academia, publishers, small and medium sized enterprises and pharmaceutical companies.
