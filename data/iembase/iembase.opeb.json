In addition, the system can explain the rationale of its results, suggest possible tests that would assist in narrowing down the differential diagnosis, and provide access to its database of biochemical, molecular, and clinical information if more evidence is desired.","homepage":"http://iembase.org/","name":"IEMbase"}}
