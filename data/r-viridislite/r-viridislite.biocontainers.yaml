description: Port of the new matplotlib color maps (viridis - the default -, magma,
  plasma and inferno) to R. matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/ > is a popular plotting
  library for python. These color maps are designed in such a way that they will analytically
  be perfectly perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted
  to black-and-white. They are also designed to be perceived by readers with the most
  common form of color blindness.
