However, correlation coefficients or linear regression models are not able to model sophisticated relationships among gene expression profiles. Here, we address the 3-way interaction that 2 genes\u2019 expression levels are clustered in different space locations under the control of a third gene\u2019s expression levels. Res ults: We present xSyn, a software tool for identifying such 3-way interactions from cancer gene expression data based on an optimization procedure involving the usage of UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) and synergy. The effectiveness is demonstrated by application to 2 real gene expression data sets. Conclusi ons: xSyn is a useful tool for decoding the complex relationships among gene expression profiles. xSyn is available at http://www.bdxconsult.com/xSyn.html.",
