      "sc:description": "a Technique to Discover Single-cell Biomarker Using 2D Visual Information.\n\nIn this work, we design the Polar Gini Curve (PGC) technique, which combines the gene expression and the 2D embedded visual information to detect biomarkers from single-cell data. Theoretically, a Polar Gini Curve characterizes the shape and ‘evenness’ of cell-point distribution of cell-point set. To quantify whether a gene could be a marker in a cell cluster, we can combine two Polar Gini Curves: one drawn upon the cell-points expressing the gene, and the other drawn upon all cell-points in the cluster. We hypothesize that the closers these two curves are, the more likely the gene would be cluster markers. We demonstrate the framework in several simulation case-studies. Applying our framework in analyzing neonatal mouse heart single-cell data, the detected biomarkers may characterize novel subtypes of cardiac muscle cells",
