description: Exonerate allows you to align sequences using a many alignment models,
  using either exhaustive dynamic programming, or a variety of heuristics. Much of
  the functionality of the Wise dynamic programming suite was reimplemented in C for
  better efficiency. Exonerate is an intrinsic component of the building of the Ensembl
  genome databases, providing similarity scores between RNA and DNA sequences and
  thus determining splice variants and coding sequences in general. . An In-silico
  PCR Experiment Simulation System (see the ipcress man page) is packaged with exonerate.
  . This package also comes with a selection of utilities for performing simple manipulations
  quickly on fasta files beyond 2Gb
