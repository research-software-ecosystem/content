We introduce bounded sparse dynamic programming (BSDP) to allow rapid approximation to exhaustive alignment. This is used within a framework whereby the alignment algorithms are described in terms of their underlying model, to allow automated development of efficient heuristic implementations which may be applied to a general set of sequence comparison problems. Results: The speed and accuracy of this approach compares favourably with existing methods. Examples of its use in the context of genome annotation are given. Conclusions: This system allows rapid implementation of heuristics approximating to many complex alignment models, and has been incorporated into the freely available sequence alignment program, exonerate. \u00a9 2005 Slater and Birney; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 770, "authors": [{"name": "Slater G.St.C."}, {"name": "Birney E."}], "date": "2005-02-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ensembl Helpdesk", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ensembl-helpdesk@ebi.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:exonerate", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/%7Eguy/exonerate", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pairwise sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0491"}, {"term": "Protein threading", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0302"}, {"term": "Genome alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3182"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A tool for pairwise sequence alignment.
