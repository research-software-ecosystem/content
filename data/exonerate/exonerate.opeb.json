We introduce bounded sparse dynamic programming (BSDP) to allow rapid approximation to exhaustive alignment. This is used within a framework whereby the alignment algorithms are described in terms of their underlying model, to allow automated development of efficient heuristic implementations which may be applied to a general set of sequence comparison problems. Results: The speed and accuracy of this approach compares favourably with existing methods. Examples of its use in the context of genome annotation are given. Conclusions: This system allows rapid implementation of heuristics approximating to many complex alignment models, and has been incorporated into the freely available sequence alignment program, exonerate. © 2005 Slater and Birney; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Slater G.St.C.","Birney E."],"cit_count":770,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pmid":"15713233","title":"Automated generation of heuristics for biological sequence comparison","year":"2005-02-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:exonerate","biotoolsID":"exonerate","description":"A tool for pairwise sequence alignment.
