                "abstract": "Large-scale multidimensional cancer genomic and pharmacological profiles have been created by several large consortium projects, including NCI-60, GDSC and DepMap, providing novel opportunities for data mining and further understanding of intrinsic therapeutic response mechanisms. However, it is increasingly challenging for experimental biologists, especially those without a bioinformatic background, to integrate, explore, and analyse these tremendous pharmacogenomics. To address this gap, IMOPAC, an interactive and easy-to-use web-based tool, was introduced to provide rapid visualizations and customizable functionalities on the basis of these three publicly available databases, which may reduce pharmacogenomic profiles from cell lines into readily understandable genetic, epigenetic, transcriptionomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and pharmacological events. The user-friendly query interface together with customized data storage enables users to interactively investigate and visualize multiomics alterations across genes and pathways and to link these alterations with drug responses across cell lines from diverse cancer types. The analyses in our portal include pancancer expression, drug-omics/pathway correlation, cancer subtypes, omics-omics (cis-/trans-regulation) correlation, fusion query analysis, and drug response prediction analysis. The comprehensive multiomics and pharmacogenomic analyses with simple clicking through IMOPAC will significantly benefit cancer precision medicine, contribute to the discoveries of potential biological mechanisms and facilitate pharmacogenomics mining in the identification of clinically actionable biomarkers for both basic researchers and clinical practitioners. IMOPAC is freely available at http://www.hbpding.com/IMOPAC.",
