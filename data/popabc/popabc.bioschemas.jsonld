  "sc:description": "Computer package to estimate historical demographic parameters of closely related species/populations (e.g. population size, migration rate, mutation rate, recombination rate, splitting events) within a Isolation with migration model. The software performs coalescent simulation in the framework of approximate Bayesian computation. It can also be used to perform Bayesian model choice to discriminate between different demographic scenarios.",
