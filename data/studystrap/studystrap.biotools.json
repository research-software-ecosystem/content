    "description": "Covariate-Profile Similarity Weighting and Bagging Studies with the Study Strap.\n\nPrediction settings with multiple studies have become increasingly common. Ensembling models trained on individual studies has been shown to improve replicability in new studies. Motivated by a groundbreaking new technology in human neuroscience, we introduce two generalizations of multi-study ensemble predictions. First, while existing methods weight ensemble elements by cross-study prediction performance, we extend weighting schemes to also incorporate covariate similarity between training data and target validation studies. Second, we introduce a hierarchical resampling scheme to generate pseudo-study replicates (\u201cstudy straps\u201d) and ensemble classifiers trained on these rather than the original studies themselves. We demonstrate analytically that existing methods are special cases",
