      "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PCSR people', 'XDR-TB' | Palliative care and symptom relief for people affected by multidrug-resistant tuberculosis | The World Health Organization (WHO) defines palliative care as the prevention and relief of the physical, psychological, social and spiritual suffering of adults and children with life-threatening illnesses and psycho-social support for their families. Palliative care and symptom relief (PCSR) also addresses suffering in nonlife-threatening situations such as after cure. PCSR should never be considered a substitute for tuberculosis (TB) prevention and treatment, but should be accessible by everyone in need. PCSR can reduce suffering and improve quality of life of patients with end-stage chronic illnesses while reducing costs for health care systems and providing financial risk protection for patients' families",
