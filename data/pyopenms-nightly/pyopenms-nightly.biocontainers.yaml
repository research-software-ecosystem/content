description: This package contains Python bindings for a large part of the OpenMS
  library for mass spectrometry based proteomics. It thus provides providing facile
  access to a feature-rich, open-source algorithm library for mass-spectrometry based
  proteomics analysis. These Python bindings allow raw access to the data-structures
  and algorithms implemented in OpenMS, specifically those for file access (mzXML,
  mzML, TraML, mzIdentML among others), basic signal processing (smoothing, filtering,
  de-isotoping and peak-picking) and complex data analysis (including label-free,
  SILAC, iTRAQ and SWATH analysis tools).
