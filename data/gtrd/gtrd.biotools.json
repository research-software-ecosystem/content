    "description": "An integrated view of transcription regulation.\n\nChIP-seq experiment information were collected in semi-automated way from literature, GEO and ENCODE.\n\nRaw ChIP-seq data in the form of fastq and SRA files were fetched from ENCODE and SRA databases.\n\nClusters for the same TF revealed by different peak calling methods were joined into metaclusters. Metaclusters represent non-redundant set of transcription factor binding sites. The clustering algorithm used in GTRD is described in the main GTRD paper [6].",

With the latest release, the database has reached a new level of data integration. All cell types (cell lines and tissues) presented in the GTRD were arranged into a dictionary and linked with different ontologies (BRENDA, Cell Ontology, Uberon, Cellosaurus and Experimental Factor Ontology) and with related experiments in specialized databases on transcription regulation (FANTOM5, ENCODE and GTEx). The updated version of the GTRD provides an integrated view of transcription regulation through a dedicated web interface with advanced browsing and search capabilities, an integrated genome browser, and table reports by cell types, transcription factors, and genes of interest.",
