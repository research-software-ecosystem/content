  description: Comfortable and intuitive protein alignment editor / viewer
  long_description: " Strap is started from the menu \"Science\" in the \"Applications\"\
    \ menu\n or with the shell command strap_protein_alignment.  Alignments can be\n\
    \ manually edited or computed automatically using sequence and/or\n structure
    based methods.  Information can be attached to proteins and\n residue selections
    such as free text notes, balloon messages,\n cross-references as well as 3D and
    PDF display styles.  Alignments\n can be exported in several formats: Multiple-Fasta,
    ClustalW, MSF,\n HSSP, Jalview.  Decorated alignments with residue annotations
    and\n secondary structure cartoons can be exported to PDF, HTML and\n Word-processors
    to create figures in publication quality - see\n http://3d-alignment.eu/ for details.
    Strap is an integrated\n environment for Bioinformatics tools and resources like
    DAS sequence\n features, 3D-visualization, structure prediction and Blast search.
    It\n is scriptable and extendable and can be used by other programs to\n display
    sequence alignments and 3D-superpositions."
