description: "HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation\
  \ sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) to a population of human genomes (as well\
  \ as against a single reference genome). Based on an extension of BWT for graphs\
  \ a graph FM index (GFM) was designed and implementd. In addition to using one global\
  \ GFM index that represents a population of human genomes, HISAT2 uses a large set\
  \ of small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index representing\
  \ a genomic region of 56 Kbp, with 55,000 indexes needed to cover the human population).\
  \ These small indexes (called local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies,\
  \ enable rapid and accurate alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme\
  \ is called a Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM).\n"
