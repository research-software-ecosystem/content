This project was originally jointly developed between Durham and Lancaster Universities. SCIMAP is supported by the U.K.’s Natural Environment Research Council, the Eden Rivers Trust, the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency. Following this project SCIMAP has been supported by Durham University, the Rivers Trust and the Environment Agency",
