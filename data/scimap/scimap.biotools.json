    "description": "Identifying critical source areas using multiple methods for effective diffuse pollution mitigation | A framework for modelling and mapping diffuse pollution risk across landscapes | SCIMAP - Diffuse Pollution Risk Mapping | To identify the locations that are a problem, we developed SCIMAP. This project was originally jointly developed between Durham and Lancaster Universities. SCIMAP is supported by the U.K.\u2019s Natural Environment Research Council, the Eden Rivers Trust, the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency. Following this project SCIMAP has been supported by Durham University, the Rivers Trust and the Environment Agency",
