The Mediterranean basin has been the theater of migration crossroads followed by settlement of several societies and cultures in prehistoric and historical times, with important consequences on genetic and genomic determinisms. Here, we present the Mediterranean Founder Mutation Database (MFMD), established to offer web-based access to founder mutation information in the Mediterranean population. Mutation data were collected from the literature and other online resources and systematically reviewed and assembled into this database. The information provided for each founder mutation includes DNA change, amino-acid change, mutation type and mutation effect, as well as mutation frequency and coalescence time when available. Currently, the database contains 383 founder mutations found in 210 genes related to 219 diseases. We believe that MFMD will help scientists and physicians to design more rapid and less expensive genetic diagnostic tests. Moreover, the coalescence time of founder mutations gives an overview about the migration history of the Mediterranean population. MFMD can be publicly accessed from http://mfmd.pasteur.ma.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Charoute H."}, {"name": "Bakhchane A."}, {"name": "Benrahma H."}, {"name": "Romdhane L."}, {"name": "Gabi K."}, {"name": "Rouba H."}, {"name": "Fakiri M."}, {"name": "Abdelhak S."}, {"name": "Lenaers G."}, {"name": "Barakat A."}], "date": "2015-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Human Mutation"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Abdelhamid Barakat", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hamid.barakat@pasteur.ma"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Hicham Charoute", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hcharoute@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mfmd", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mfmd.pasteur.ma/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Taking Advantage from Founder Mutations in Genetics Diagnosis, Genetic Diversity and Migration History of the Mediterranean Population.", "toolType": ["Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "mfmd", "additionDate": "2018-05-22T15:23:15Z", "name": "MFMD", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
