Although many peak-calling algorithms include a fragment-length estimation subroutine, the problem has not been adequately solved, as demonstrated by the variability of the estimates returned by different algorithms.Results: In this article, we investigate the use of strand cross-correlation to estimate mean fragment length of single-end data and show that traditional estimation approaches have mixed reliability. We observe that the mappability of different parts of the genome can introduce an artificial bias into cross-correlation computations, resulting in incorrect fragment-length estimates. We propose a new approach, called mappability-sensitive cross-correlation (MaSC), which removes this bias and allows for accurate and reliable fragment-length estimation. We analyze the computational complexity of this approach, and evaluate its performance on a test suite of NGS datasets, demonstrating its superiority to traditional cross-correlation analysis.Availability: An open-source Perl implementation of our approach is available at http://www.perkinslab.ca/Software.html. \u00a9 2013 The Author.", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Ramachandran P."}, {"name": "Palidwor G.A."}, {"name": "Porter C.J."}, {"name": "Perkins T.J."}], "date": "2013-02-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.perkinslab.ca/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "theodore.j.perkins@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:masc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.perkinslab.ca/Software.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Perl implementation of our MaSC approach to estimating fragment length from short-read high-throughput sequencing data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/masc-mappability-sensitive-cross-correlation.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "masc", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:50:31Z", "name": "MaSC", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.perkinslab.ca/sites/perkinslab.ca/files/README_0.TXT", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
