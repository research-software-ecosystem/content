All rights reserved.A large fraction of microRNAs (miRNAs) are derived from intergenic non-coding loci and the identification of their promoters remains 'elusive'. Here, we present microTSS, a machine-learning algorithm that provides highly accurate, single-nucleotide resolution predictions for intergenic miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs). MicroTSS integrates high-resolution RNA-sequencing data with active transcription marks derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation and DNase-sequencing to enable the characterization of tissue-specific promoters. MicroTSS is validated with a specifically designed Drosha-null/conditional-null mouse model, generated using the conditional by inversion (COIN) methodology. Analyses of global run-on sequencing data revealed numerous pri-miRNAs in human and mouse either originating from divergent transcription at promoters of active genes or partially overlapping with annotated long non-coding RNAs. MicroTSS is readily applicable to any cell or tissue samples and constitutes the missing part towards integrating the regulation of miRNA transcription into the modelling of tissue-specific regulatory networks.", "citationCount": 22, "authors": [{"name": "Georgakilas G."}, {"name": "Vlachos I.S."}, {"name": "Paraskevopoulou M.D."}, {"name": "Yang P."}, {"name": "Zhang Y."}, {"name": "Economides A.N."}, {"name": "Hatzigeorgiou A.G."}], "date": "2014-12-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Communications"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.microrna.gr", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "artemis.hatzigeorgiou@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:microtss", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.microrna.gr/microTSS", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0226"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-12T15:33:18Z", "otherID": [], "description": "microTSS is a machine-learning algorithm that provides highly accurate, single-nucleotide resolution predictions for intergenic miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs).
