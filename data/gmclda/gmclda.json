    "description": "Predicting human lncRNA-disease associations based on geometric matrix completion.\n\nRecently, increasing evidences have indicated that dysregulations of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are implicated in various complex diseases. However, only a limited number of lncRNA-disease associations are experimentally verified. Prioritizing potential lncRNA-disease associations is beneficial not only for understanding disease mechanisms at lncRNA level, but also for disease diagnosis. Various computational methods have been proposed, but precise prediction and full use of data's intrinsic structure are still challenging. In this study, we propose a new method, named GMCLDA (Geometric Matrix Completion lncRNA-Disease Association), to infer potential lncRNA-disease associations based on geometric matrix completion.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
