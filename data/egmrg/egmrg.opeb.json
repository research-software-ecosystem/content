Microorganisms are recognised by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, which signal through the adaptor molecule MyD88. Methods: To identify host responses induced by gut microbiota along the length of the gut and whether these required MyD88, transcriptional profiles of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon were compared from germ-free and conventionally raised wild-type and Myd88-/- mice. The gut microbial ecology was assessed by 454-based pyrosequencing and viruses were analysed by PCR. Results: The gut microbiota modulated the expression of a large set of genes in the small intestine and fewer genes in the colon but surprisingly few microbiota-regulated genes required MyD88 signalling. However, MyD88 was essential for microbiota-induced colonic expression of the antimicrobial genes Reg3β and Reg3γin the epithelium, and Myd88 deficiency was associated with both a shift in bacterial diversity and a greater proportion of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. In addition, conventionally raised Myd88-/- mice had increased expression of antiviral genes in the colon, which correlated with norovirus infection in the colonic epithelium. Conclusion: This study provides a detailed description of tissue-specific host transcriptional responses to the normal gut microbiota along the length of the gut and demonstrates that the absence of MyD88 alters gut microbial ecology.","authors":["Larsson E.","Tremaroli V.","Lee Y.S.","Koren O.","Nookaew I.","Fricker A.","Nielsen J.","Ley R.E.","Backhed F."],"cit_count":156,"doi":"10.1136/gutjnl-2011-301104","journal":"Gut","title":"Analysis of gut microbial regulation of host gene expression along the length of the gut and regulation of gut microbial ecology through MyD88","type":"Other","year":"2012-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:egmrg","biotoolsID":"egmrg","description":"Encyclopedia of microbiota regulated genes.","homepage":"http://microbiota.wall.gu.se/","name":"EGMRG"}}
