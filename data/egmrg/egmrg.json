Microorganisms are recognised by pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors, which signal through the adaptor molecule MyD88. Methods: To identify host responses induced by gut microbiota along the length of the gut and whether these required MyD88, transcriptional profiles of duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon were compared from germ-free and conventionally raised wild-type and Myd88-/- mice. The gut microbial ecology was assessed by 454-based pyrosequencing and viruses were analysed by PCR. Results: The gut microbiota modulated the expression of a large set of genes in the small intestine and fewer genes in the colon but surprisingly few microbiota-regulated genes required MyD88 signalling. However, MyD88 was essential for microbiota-induced colonic expression of the antimicrobial genes Reg3\u03b2 and Reg3\u03b3in the epithelium, and Myd88 deficiency was associated with both a shift in bacterial diversity and a greater proportion of segmented filamentous bacteria in the small intestine. In addition, conventionally raised Myd88-/- mice had increased expression of antiviral genes in the colon, which correlated with norovirus infection in the colonic epithelium. Conclusion: This study provides a detailed description of tissue-specific host transcriptional responses to the normal gut microbiota along the length of the gut and demonstrates that the absence of MyD88 alters gut microbial ecology.", "citationCount": 156, "authors": [{"name": "Larsson E."}, {"name": "Tremaroli V."}, {"name": "Lee Y.S."}, {"name": "Koren O."}, {"name": "Nookaew I."}, {"name": "Fricker A."}, {"name": "Nielsen J."}, {"name": "Ley R.E."}, {"name": "Backhed F."}], "date": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Gut"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "bils.se", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "fredrik.backhed@wlab.gu.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:egmrg", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://microbiota.wall.gu.se/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Gene name", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2299"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Gene expression data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2603"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Encyclopedia of microbiota regulated genes.", "toolType": ["Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "egmrg", "additionDate": "2015-12-06T15:18:14Z", "name": "EGMRG", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://microbiota.wall.gu.se/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
