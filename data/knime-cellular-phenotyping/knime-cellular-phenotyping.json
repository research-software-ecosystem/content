To handle and process these images, well defined image processing and analysis steps need to be performed by applying dedicated workflows. Multiple software tools have emerged with the aim to facilitate creation of such workflows by integrating existing methods, tools, and routines, and by adapting them to different applications and questions, as well as making them reusable and interchangeable. In this review, we describe workflow systems for the integration of microscopy image analysis techniques with focus on KNIME and Galaxy.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Wollmann T."}, {"name": "Erfle H."}, {"name": "Eils R."}, {"name": "Rohr K."}, {"name": "Gunkel M."}], "date": "2017-11-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Biotechnology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "maniuel.gunkel@bioquant.uni-heidelberg.de"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Thomas Wollmann", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4741-3844", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "thomas.s.wollmann@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:knime-cellular-phenotyping", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://nodepit.com/server/com.knime.hub/Users/manuel/Public", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Image analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-11-25T11:55:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This KNIME framework is a data mining platform including manifold libraries for image processing (based on Fiji/ImageJ) and data exploration.
