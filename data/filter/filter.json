Advances in next generation sequencing technologies are producing increasingly large numbers of sRNA reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. However, many bioinformatics tools do not scale accordingly, are cumbersome, or require extensive support from bioinformatics experts. Therefore, researchers need user-friendly, robust tools, capable of not only processing large sRNA datasets in a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive fashion and visualizing sRNA genomic features. Herein, we present the UEA sRNA workbench, a suite of tools that is a successor to the web-based UEA sRNA Toolkit, but in downloadable format and with several enhanced and additional features.", "citationCount": 160, "authors": [{"name": "Stocks M.B."}, {"name": "Moxon S."}, {"name": "Mapleson D."}, {"name": "Woolfenden H.C."}, {"name": "Mohorianu I."}, {"name": "Folkes L."}, {"name": "Schwach F."}, {"name": "Dalmay T."}, {"name": "Moulton V."}], "date": "2012-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Vincent Moulton", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "v.moulton@uea.ac.uk"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Tamas Dalmay", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "T.Dalmay@uea.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:filter", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/filter-2/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence contamination filtering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3187"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-24T08:08:21Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Produce a filtered version of an sRNA dataset, controlled by several user-defined criteria, including sequence length, abundance, complexity, transfer and ribosomal RNA removal.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/sRNAworkbenchuea/UEA_sRNA_Workbench/", "note": "sRNA Workbench", "type": "Repository"}], "biotoolsID": "filter", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:14:35Z", "name": "Filter", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [{"url": "http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/filter-tutorial/", "note": "Tutorial material", "type": "Training material"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
