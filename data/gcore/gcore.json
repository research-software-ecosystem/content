Motivation: Several efficient gene-gene interaction tests have been developed for unrelated case-control samples in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), making it possible to test tens of billions of interaction pairs of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a reasonable timeframe. However, current family-based gene-gene interaction tests are computationally expensive and are not applicable to genome-wide interaction analysis. Results: We developed an efficient family-based gene-gene interaction test, GCORE, for trios (i.e. two parents and one affected sib). The GCORE compares interlocus correlations at two SNPs between the transmitted and non-transmitted alleles. We used simulation studies to compare the statistical properties such as type I error rates and power for the GCORE with several other family-based interaction tests under various scenarios. We applied the GCORE to a family-based GWAS for autism consisting of approximately 2000 trios. Testing a total of 22 471 383 013 interaction pairs in the GWAS can be finished in 36 h by the GCORE without large-scale computing resources, demonstrating that the test is practical for genome-wide gene-gene interaction analysis in trios.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Sung P.-Y."}, {"name": "Wang Y.-T."}, {"name": "Yu Y.-W."}, {"name": "Chung R.-H."}], "date": "2016-06-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://rclab.nhri.org.tw/rclab/people/principal-investigator-ren-hua-chung/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "rchung@nhri.org.tw"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:gcore", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/gscore/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene to pathway mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0533"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Efficient family-based gene-gene interaction test for trios.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/gscore-fast-family-based-gene-gene-interaction-test.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "gcore", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:44:01Z", "name": "GCORE", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/gscore/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
