summary: 'ASCAT is a method to derive copy number profiles of tumour cells,

  accounting for normal cell admixture and tumour aneuploidy (Figure 1).

  ASCAT infers tumour purity (the fraction of tumour cells) and ploidy (the

  amount of DNA per tumour cell, expressed as multiples of haploid genomes)

  from SNP array or massively parallel sequencing data, and calculates

  whole-genome allele-specific copy number profiles (the number of copies of

  both parental alleles for all SNP loci across the genome).
