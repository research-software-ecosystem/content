We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of \"ASCAT profiles\" (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy (>2.7n) in 45%of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49%. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in neartriploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost,whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.","authors":["Van Loo P.","Nordgard S.H.","Lingjaerde O.C.","Russnes H.G.","Rye I.H.","Sun W.","Weigman V.J.","Marynen P.","Zetterberg A.","Naume B.","Perou C.M.","Borresen-Dale A.-L.","Kristensen V.N."],"cit_count":366,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.1009843107","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","title":"Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors","type":"Primary","year":"2010-09-28"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ascat","biotoolsID":"ascat","description":"Tool for accurate dissection of genome-wide allele-specific copy number in tumors.
