We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of \"ASCAT profiles\" (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy (>2.7n) in 45%of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49%. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in neartriploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost,whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.", "citationCount": 366, "authors": [{"name": "Van Loo P."}, {"name": "Nordgard S.H."}, {"name": "Lingjaerde O.C."}, {"name": "Russnes H.G."}, {"name": "Rye I.H."}, {"name": "Sun W."}, {"name": "Weigman V.J."}, {"name": "Marynen P."}, {"name": "Zetterberg A."}, {"name": "Naume B."}, {"name": "Perou C.M."}, {"name": "Borresen-Dale A.-L."}, {"name": "Kristensen V.N."}], "date": "2010-09-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "UiO", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Kerstin.Haase@crick.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ascat", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.4"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.crick.ac.uk/peter-van-loo/software/ASCAT", "function": [{"note": "Illumina and Affymetrix SNP array data", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Raw microarray data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_3110"}, "format": [{"term": "Binary format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2333"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Genome visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3208"}, {"term": "Copy number estimation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3233"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for accurate dissection of genome-wide allele-specific copy number in tumors.
