It accounts for normal cell admixture and tumor aneuploidy in the analysis of SNP array data from cancer samples. It allows analysis of Illumina and Affymetrix SNP array data of tumor samples (with or without matching germline samples).",

                "abstract": "We present an allele-specific copy number analysis of the in vivo breast cancer genome. We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of \"ASCAT profiles\" (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy (>2.7n) in 45%of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49%. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in neartriploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost,whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.",
