It performs greedy pruning of GWAS SNPs and then annotates them based on functional information overlap. Next, it quantifies Fold Enrichment (FE) at various GWAS significance cutoffs and assesses them by permutation testing, while matching for MAF, distance to nearest transcription start site and number of LD proxies.",
