The protein-protein binding sites can be formed by two subunits in a complex. Understanding energetics and mechanisms of complexes remains one of the essential problems in binding site prediction. We develop a system, P-Binder, for identifying binding sites based on shape complementarity, side-chain conformations and interacting amino acid information. P-Binder utilizes an enumeration method to generate all possible configurations between two proteins, and uses a side-chain packing program to identify the bound states. The system reports the binding sites with the highest ranked configurations, evaluated through a linear combination of four statistical energy items. The experiments show that our method performs better than other prediction methods. A comparison with some existing approaches shows P-Binder to improve the success rate by at least 12.3%. We test P-Binder on 176 protein-protein complexes in Benchmark v4.0. The overall values of accuracy and coverage are 63.8% and 68.8% for the bound state, and 51.0% and 60.9% for the unbound state. \u00a9 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Guo F."}, {"name": "Li S.C."}, {"name": "Fan Y."}, {"name": "Wang L."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Current Protein and Peptide Science"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://sites.google.com/site/guofeics/p-binder#TOC-Author", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "lwang@cs.cityu.edu.hk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:p-binder", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://sites.google.com/site/guofeics/p-binder", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for predicting the binding sites on pair of given proteins.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/p-binder-predicting-the-binding-sites-on-pair-of-given-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "p-binder", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:53:25Z", "name": "P-Binder", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://sites.google.com/site/guofeics/p-binder", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
