This lack of standard formats causes several problems, such as undocumented preprocessing steps or the loss of information in downstream software tools, which do not account for the specifics of the different available formats. ReadTools is an open-source Java toolkit designed to standardize and preprocess read data from different platforms. It manages FASTQ- and SAM-formatted inputs while dealing with platform-specific peculiarities and provides a standard SAM compliant output. The code and executable are available at https://github.com/magicDGS/ReadTools.","authors":["Gomez-Sanchez D.","Schlotterer C."],"cit_count":1,"journal":"Molecular Ecology Resources","pmid":"29171165","title":"ReadTools: A universal toolkit for handling sequence data from different sequencing platforms","type":"Primary","year":"2018-05-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:readtools","biotoolsID":"readtools","description":"ReadTools is an open‐source toolkit designed to standardize and preprocess sequencing read data from different platforms.
