Most SWT-related software packages have restrictive assumptions about the study design and correlation structure of the data. The objective of this paper is to present a package and corresponding web-based graphical user interface (GUI) that provide researchers with another, more flexible option for SWT design and analysis. Methods: We developed an R package swCRTdesign (\u2018stepped wedge Cluster Randomized Trial design\u2019), which uses a random effects model to account for correlation in the data induced by a SWT design. Possible sources of correlation include clusters, time within clusters, and treatment within clusters. Results: swCRTdesign allows a user to calculate power, simulate SWT data to streamline simulation studies (e.g. to estimate power), and create descriptive summaries and plots. Additionally, a GUI, developed using shiny, is available to calculate power and create power curves and design plots. Conclusions: The swCRTdesign package accommodates a wide variety of SWT designs, and makes it easy to account for some sources of correlation which are not found in other packages. The user-friendly web-based GUI makes some swCRTdesign features accessible to researchers not familiar with R. These two resources will make appropriately complex SWT calculations more accessible to scientists from a wide variety of backgrounds.",
