description: Detect Differential Clustering of Genomic Sites such as gene therapy
  integrations.  The package provides some functions for exploring genomic insertion
  sites originating from two different sources. Possibly, the two sources are two
  different gene therapy vectors.  Vectors are preferred that target sensitive regions
  less frequently, motivating the search for localized clusters of insertions and
  comparison of the clusters formed by integration of different vectors.  Scan statistics
  allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and calculation of False
  Discovery Rates (FDRs) providing statistical methods for comparing retroviral vectors.
  A scan statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window widths to detect
  clustering differentials and compute FDRs is implemented here.
