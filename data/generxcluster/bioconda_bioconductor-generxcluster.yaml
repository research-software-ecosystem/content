about:
  description: Detect Differential Clustering of Genomic Sites such as gene therapy
    integrations.  The package provides some functions for exploring genomic insertion
    sites originating from two different sources. Possibly, the two sources are two
    different gene therapy vectors.  Vectors are preferred that target sensitive regions
    less frequently, motivating the search for localized clusters of insertions and
    comparison of the clusters formed by integration of different vectors.  Scan statistics
    allow the discovery of spatial differences in clustering and calculation of False
    Discovery Rates (FDRs) providing statistical methods for comparing retroviral
    vectors. A scan statistic for comparing two vectors using multiple window widths
    to detect clustering differentials and compute FDRs is implemented here.
