  "sc:description": "This walker is designed to work as the second pass in a two-pass processing step, doing a by-read traversal. For each base in each read this walker calculates various user-specified covariates (such as read group, reported quality score, cycle, and dinuc) Using these values as a key in a large hashmap the walker calculates an empirical base quality score and overwrites the quality score currently in the read. This walker then outputs a new bam file with these updated (recalibrated) reads.",
