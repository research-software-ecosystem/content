                "abstract": "Protein structure comparison, an important problem in structural biology, has two main applications: (i) comparing two protein structures in order to identify the similarities and differences between them, and (ii) searching for structures similar to a query structure. Many web-based resources for both applications are available, but all are based on rigid structural alignment algorithms. FATCAT server implements the recently developed flexible protein structure comparison algorithm FATCAT, which automatically identifies hinges and internal rearrangements in two protein structures. The server provides access to two algorithms: FATCAT-pairwise for pairwise flexible structure comparison and FATCAT-search for database searching for structurally similar proteins. Given two protein structures [in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) format], FATCAT-pairwise reports their structural alignment and the corresponding statistical significance of the similarity measured as a P-value. Users can view the superposition of the structures online in web browsers that support the Chime plug-in, or download the superimposed structures in PDB format. In FATCAT-search, users provide one query structure and the server returns a list of protein structures that are similar to the query, ordered by the P-values. In addition, FATCAT server can report the conformational changes of the query structure as compared to other proteins in the structure database.

                "abstract": "Motivation: Protein structures are flexible and undergo structural rearrangements as part of their function, and yet most existing protein structure comparison methods treat them as rigid bodies, which may lead to incorrect alignment. Results: We have developed the Flexible structure AlignmenT by Chaining AFPs (Aligned Fragment Pairs) with Twists (FATCAT), a new method for structural alignment of proteins. The FATCAT approach simultaneously addresses the two major goals of flexible structure alignment; optimizing the alignment and minimizing the number of rigid-body movements (twists) around pivot points (hinges) introduced in the reference protein. In contrast, currently existing flexible structure alignment programs treat the hinge detection as a post-process of a standard rigid body alignment. We illustrate the advantages of the FATCAT approach by several examples of comparison between proteins known to adopt different conformations, where the FATCAT algorithm achieves more accurate structure alignments than current methods, while at the same time introducing fewer hinges. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2003; all rights reserved.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.FATCAT 2.0 server (http://fatcat.godziklab.org/), provides access to a flexible protein structure alignment algorithm developed in our group. In such an alignment, rotations and translations between elements in the structure are allowed to minimize the overall root mean square deviation (RMSD) between the compared structures. This allows to effectively compare protein structures even if they underwent structural rearrangements in different functional forms, different crystallization conditions or as a result of mutations. The major update for the server introduces a new graphical interface, much faster database searches and several new options for visualization of the structural differences between proteins.",
