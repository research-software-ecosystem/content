These peptides are termed neoantigen and it is important to understand this process for cancer immunotherapy. Here, we introduce an R package that can predict a list of potential neoantigens from a variety of mutations, which include not only somatic point mutations but insertions, deletions, and structural variants.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'hase62', 'multifunctional', 'neoantigens', 'package'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/869388","name":"neoantigen"}}
