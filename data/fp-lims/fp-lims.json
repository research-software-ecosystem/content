Its first version was based on spectroscopy-giant Spectro's(Ametek) in-house Laboratory data management solution. Its primarily used in metallurgy & foundry QM-laboratories where it is used for audit-trailing, certification, managing the passing of data from devices to an immutable data-store as well as upwards to systems such as the SAP QM module.\nFP-LIMS was formerly distributed as [DIA]/DIA2000/DIAPLUS.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Delphi"], "link": [{"url": "https://www.fp-lims.com/fp-lims/module/", "note": "Module-overview", "type": "Other"}], "biotoolsID": "FP-LIMS", "additionDate": "2019-03-05T12:03:12Z", "name": "FP-LIMS", "license": "Proprietary", "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.fp-lims.com/kontakt/support-faq/", "note": null, "type": "FAQ"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
