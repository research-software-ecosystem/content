    "description": "FP-LIMS is a LIMS solution specialized on mass spectroscopy measurement equipment. Primary  compatible device manufacturers include: Spectro / Ametek,Agilent Technologies,Analytik Jena AG,Bruker,Hitachi / Oxford Instruments,Horiba Jobin Yvon GmbH,Malvern Panalytical,Microtrac GmbH,OBLF,PerkinElmer,Thermo Fisher,Zwick.\n\n\nFP-LIMS was first released in 1993. Its first version was based on spectroscopy-giant Spectro's(Ametek) in-house Laboratory data management solution. Its primarily used in metallurgy & foundry QM-laboratories where it is used for audit-trailing, certification, managing the passing of data from devices to an immutable data-store as well as upwards to systems such as the SAP QM module.\nFP-LIMS was formerly distributed as [DIA]/DIA2000/DIAPLUS.",
