MGD maintains a comprehensive, unified, non-redundant catalog of mouse genome features generated by distilling gene predictions from NCBI, Ensembl and VEGA. MGD serves as the authoritative source for the nomenclature of mouse genes, mutations, alleles and strains. MGD is the primary source for evidence-supported functional annotations for mouse genes and gene products using the Gene Ontology (GO). MGD provides full annotation of phenotypes and human disease associations for mouse models (genotypes) using terms from the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology and disease names from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) resource. MGD is freely accessible online through our website, where users can browse and search interactively, access data in bulk using Batch Query or BioMart, download data files or use our web services Application Programming Interface (API). Improvements to MGD include expanded genome feature classifications, inclusion of new mutant allele sets and phenotype associations and extensions of GO to include new relationships and a new stream of annotations via phylogenetic-based approaches. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.", "citationCount": 199, "authors": [{"name": "Eppig J.T."}, {"name": "Blake J.A."}, {"name": "Bult C.J."}, {"name": "Kadin J.A."}, {"name": "Richardson J.E."}, {"name": "Airey M.T."}, {"name": "Anagnostopoulos A."}, {"name": "Babiuk R."}, {"name": "Baldarelli R.M."}, {"name": "Beal J.S."}, {"name": "Bello S.M."}, {"name": "Butler N.E."}, {"name": "Campbell J."}, {"name": "Corbani L.E."}, {"name": "Giannatto S.L."}, {"name": "Dene H."}, {"name": "Dolan M.E."}, {"name": "Drabkin H.R."}, {"name": "Forthofer K.L."}, {"name": "Knowlton M."}, {"name": "Lewis J.R."}, {"name": "McAndrews-Hill M."}, {"name": "McClatchy S."}, {"name": "Miers D.S."}, {"name": "Ni L."}, {"name": "Onda H."}, {"name": "Ormsby J.E."}, {"name": "Recla J.M."}, {"name": "Reed D.J."}, {"name": "Richards-Smith B."}, {"name": "Shaw D.R."}, {"name": "Sinclair R."}, {"name": "Sitnikov D."}, {"name": "Smith C.L."}, {"name": "Tomczuk M."}, {"name": "Washburn L.L."}, {"name": "Zhu Y."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/support/mgi_inbox.shtml", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mgi-help@jax.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mgd", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.informatics.jax.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Data retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"}, {"term": "Genotyping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3196"}, {"term": "Genetic mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0282"}, {"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Community model organism database for the laboratory mouse and the source for phenotype and functional annotations of mouse genes.
