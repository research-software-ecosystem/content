description: 'This is a non-parametric method for joint adaptive mean-variance regularization
  and variance stabilization of high-dimensional data. It is suited for handling difficult
  problems posed by high-dimensional multivariate datasets (p >> n paradigm). Among
  those are that the variance is often a function of the mean, variable-specific estimators
  of variances are not reliable, and tests statistics have low powers due to a lack
  of degrees of freedom. Key features include: (i) Normalization and/or variance stabilization
  of the data, (ii) Computation of mean-variance-regularized t-statistics (F-statistics
  to follow), (iii) Generation of diverse diagnostic plots, (iv) Computationally efficient
  implementation using C/C++ interfacing and an option for parallel computing to enjoy
  a faster and easier experience in the R environment.'
