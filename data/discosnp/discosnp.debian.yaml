description: "Software discoSnp is designed for discovering Single Nucleotide Polymorphism\
  \ (SNP) from raw set(s) of reads obtained with Next Generation Sequencers (NGS).\
  \ . Note that number of input read sets is not constrained, it can be one, two,\
  \ or more. Note also that no other data as reference genome or annotations are needed.\
  \ . The software is composed by two modules. First module, kissnp2, detects SNPs\
  \ from read sets. A second module, kissreads, enhance the kissnp2 results by computing\
  \ per read set  and for each found SNP: .\n 1) its mean read coverage\n 2) the (phred)\
  \ quality of reads generating the polymorphism.\n. This program is superseded by\
  \ DiscoSnp++.\n"
