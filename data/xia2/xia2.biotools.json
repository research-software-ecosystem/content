This can automatically identify multi-wedge, multi-pass and multiwavelength data sets and includes explicit procedures to test for crystallographic special cases. With the push towards high-thoughput crystallography at synchrotron beamlines and automation of structure solution, the ability to reduce data with no user input fills an important gap in the pipeline. © 2010 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore-all rights reserved.",
