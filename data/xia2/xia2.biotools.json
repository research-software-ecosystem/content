This can automatically identify multi-wedge, multi-pass and multiwavelength data sets and includes explicit procedures to test for crystallographic special cases. With the push towards high-thoughput crystallography at synchrotron beamlines and automation of structure solution, the ability to reduce data with no user input fills an important gap in the pipeline. \u00a9 2010 International Union of Crystallography Printed in Singapore-all rights reserved.",
