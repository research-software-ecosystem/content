  "sc:description": "The classification protocol starts with a feature selection step and continues with nearest-centroid classification. The accurarcy of the predictor can be evaluated using training and test set validation, leave-one-out cross-validation or in a multiple random validation protocol. Methods for calculation and visualization of continuous prediction scores allow to balance sensitivity and specificity and define a cutoff value according to clinical requirements.",
