Metroid can be executed as a software with a graphical user interface (Windows only, click here to download the installer) or its code can be run in jupyter notebooks (check the Examples folder).

                "abstract": "© 2020 The Author(s).Background: In cell biology, increasing focus has been directed to fast events at subcellular space with the advent of fluorescent probes. As an example, voltage sensitive dyes (VSD) have been used to measure membrane potentials. Yet, even the most recently developed genetically encoded voltage sensors have demanded exhausting signal averaging through repeated experiments to quantify action potentials (AP). This analysis may be further hampered in subcellular signals defined by small regions of interest (ROI), where signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) may fall substantially. Signal processing techniques like blind source separation (BSS) are designed to separate a multichannel mixture of signals into uncorrelated or independent sources, whose potential to separate ROI signal from noise has been poorly explored. Our aims are to develop a method capable of retrieving subcellular events with minimal a priori information from noisy cell fluorescence images and to provide it as a computational tool to be readily employed by the scientific community. Results: In this paper, we have developed METROID (Morphological Extraction of Transmembrane potential from Regions Of Interest Device), a new computational tool to filter fluorescence signals from multiple ROIs, whose code and graphical interface are freely available. In this tool, we developed a new ROI definition procedure to automatically generate similar-area ROIs that follow cell shape. In addition, simulations and real data analysis were performed to recover AP and electroporation signals contaminated by noise by means of four types of BSS: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and two versions with discrete wavelet transform (DWT). All these strategies allowed for signal extraction at low SNR (- 10 dB) without apparent signal distortion. Conclusions: We demonstrate the great capability of our method to filter subcellular signals from noisy fluorescence images in a single trial, avoiding repeated experiments. We provide this novel biomedical application with a graphical user interface at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11344046.v1, and its code and datasets are available in GitHub at https://github.com/zoccoler/metroid.",
