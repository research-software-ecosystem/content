  "sc:description": "Rhea is a comprehensive and non-redundant resource of expert-curated chemical and transport reactions of biological interest developed by the Swiss-Prot group at SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.\nRhea can be used for enzyme annotation, genome-scale metabolic modeling and omics-related analysis. Rhea describes enzyme-catalyzed reactions covering the IUBMB Enzyme Nomenclature list as well as additional reactions, including spontaneously occurring reactions. \nRhea is built on ChEBI (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules to describe its reaction participants. \nSince December 2018, Rhea is the standard for enzyme annotation in UniProt.",
