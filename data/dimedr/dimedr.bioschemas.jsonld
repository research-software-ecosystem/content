      "sc:description": "DIMEDR (Disparate Metabolomics Data Reassembler) is a algorithm for agglomerating incongruent LC-MS metabolomics datasets. (DIMEDR) attempts to bridge the inconsistencies between incongruent LC-MS metabolomics datasets of the same biological sample type. A single “primary” dataset is postprocessed via traditional means of peak identification, alignment, and grouping. DIMEDR utilizes this primary dataset as a progenitor template by which data from subsequent disparate datasets are reassembled and integrated into a unified framework that maximizes spectral feature similarity across all samples. This is accomplished by a novel procedure for universal retention time correction and comparison via identification of ubiquitous features in the initial primary dataset, which are subsequently utilized as endogenous internal standards during integration.",
