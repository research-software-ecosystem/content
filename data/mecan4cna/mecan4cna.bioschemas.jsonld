It’s crucial to normalize CN profiles when comparing them in analysis, because usually each profile has a different signal scale | Mecan4CNA (Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Copy Number Analysis) uses an algebraic method to estimate the baseline and the distance between DNA levels (referred to as level distance).
