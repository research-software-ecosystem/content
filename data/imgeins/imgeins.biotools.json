In particular, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are one of the major constituents of the human genomes, and cause genome instability by insertion, mutation, and rearrangement. Result: We have developed a new program, iMGEins, to identify such novel MGEs by using sequencing reads of individual genomes, and to explore the breakpoints with the supporting reads and MGEs detected. iMGEins is the first MGE detection program that integrates three algorithmic components: discordant read-pair mapping, split-read mapping, and insertion sequence assembly. Our evaluation results showed its outstanding performance in detecting novel MGEs from simulated genomes, as well as real personal genomes. In detail, the average recall and precision rates of iMGEins are 96.67 and 100%, respectively, which are the highest among the programs compared. In the testing with real human genomes of the NA12878 sample, iMGEins shows the highest accuracy in detecting MGEs within 20 bp proximity of the breakpoints annotated. Conclusion: In order to study the dynamics of MGEs in individual genomes, iMGEins was developed to accurately detect breakpoints and report inserted MGEs. Compared with other programs, iMGEins has valuable features of identifying novel MGEs and assembling the MGEs inserted.",
