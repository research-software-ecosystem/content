description: 'These functions were developed to support functional data analysis as
  described in Ramsay, J. O. and Silverman, B. W. (2005) Functional Data Analysis.
  New York: Springer.  They were ported from earlier versions in Matlab and S-PLUS.  An
  introduction appears in Ramsay, J. O., Hooker, Giles, and Graves, Spencer (2009)
  Functional Data Analysis with R and Matlab (Springer). The package includes data
  sets and script files working many examples including all but one of the 76 figures
  in this latter book.  Matlab versions of the code and sample analyses are no longer
  distributed through CRAN, as they were when the book was published.  For those,
  ftp from http://www.psych.mcgill.ca/misc/fda/downloads/FDAfuns/ There you find a
  set of .zip files containing the functions and sample analyses, as well as two .txt
  files giving instructions for installation and some additional information. The
  changes from Version 2.4.1 are fixes of bugs in density.fd and removal of functions
  create.polynomial.basis, polynompen, and  polynomial. These were deleted because
  the monomial basis does the same thing and because there were errors in the code.'
