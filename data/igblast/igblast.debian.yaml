description: IgBLAST allows users to view the matches to the germline V, D, and J
  genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of IG V domain framework
  regions, and complementarity determining regions. IgBLAST has the capability to
  analyse nucleotide and protein sequences, and can process sequences in batches.
  Furthermore, IgBLAST allows searches against the germline gene databases and other
  sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the chance of missing possibly the
  best matching germline V gene.
