  description: Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor variable domain sequence analysis
  long_description: " IgBLAST allows users to view the matches to the germline V,\
    \ D, and J\n genes, details at rearrangement junctions, the delineation of IG\
    \ V\n domain framework regions, and complementarity determining regions.\n IgBLAST\
    \ has the capability to analyse nucleotide and protein\n sequences, and can process\
    \ sequences in batches.  Furthermore,\n IgBLAST allows searches against the germline\
    \ gene databases and other\n sequence databases simultaneously to minimize the\
    \ chance of missing\n possibly the best matching germline V gene."
