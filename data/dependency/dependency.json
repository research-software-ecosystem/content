Functional constraints may lead to co-variation of two or more amino acids in the sequence, such that a substitution at one site is accompanied by compensatory substitutions at another site. It is not sufficient to find the statistical correlations between sites in the alignment because these may be the result of several undetermined causes. In particular, phylogenetic clustering will lead to many strong correlations. Result: A procedure is developed to detect statistical correlations stemming from functional interaction by removing the strong phylogenetic signal that leads to the correlations of each site with many others in the sequence. Our method relies upon the accuracy of the alignment but it does not require any assumptions about the phylogeny or the substitution process. The effectiveness of the method was verified using computer simulations and then applied to predict functional interactions between amino acids in the Pfam database of alignments. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2002.", "citationCount": 91, "authors": [{"name": "Tillier E.R.M."}, {"name": "Lui T.W.H."}], "date": "2003-04-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.uhnresearch.ca/labs/tillier/index.htm", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:dependency", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.uhnresearch.ca/labs/tillier/software.htm#2", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Residue interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0272"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-16T12:55:31Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A program using Multiple Interdependency to detect functional interactions between amino acids in proteins.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/dependency-2-1-detect-functional-interactions-amino-acids-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "dependency", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:05:48Z", "name": "Dependency", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://wwwlabs.uhnresearch.ca/tillier/software.htm#2", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows"]}
