    "description": "Complete system used to store and analyze gene expression data. It has a relational database, a web interface, and an analysis suite. There is also a repository for each user\u2019s files, and a comprehensive security system. The program is intended to be a multiuser archive for gene chip data, as well as a friendly, powerful analysis tool for end users. It includes workflow management features for the microarray center, and for the individual research labs.",

                "abstract": "Developed by the Virginia Bioinformatics Consortium (VBC). GeneX Va is an open source, freeware database and bioinformatics analysis software for archiving and analyzing Affymetrix GeneChip\u00ae data. It provides an integrated framework for management, documentation, and analysis of microarray experiments and data to support a range of users, from individual research laboratories to institutional microarray facilities. GeneX Va also provides web-based access to a PostgreSQL relational database system with a comprehensive security system. Data can be extracted from the database and delivered to interactive or scriptable statistical analysis protocols. The security system allows each investigator to manage their own array data and analysis output files and also provides custom access privileges for other users, groups, and internal/external collaborators. The analysis interface uses \"Analysis Trees,\" an innovative user interface that allows researchers to interactively create a tree-structured flow chart of analysis routines. The latest GeneX Va software is available from and can be freely downloaded at the Sourceforge web site http://va-genex.sourceforge.net. To allow researchers to access the database and analysis capabilities of the GeneX Va system, microarray data from many VBC GeneChip experiments have been deposited into a public section of the GeneX Va system at the University of Virginia. The VBC GeneX Va sites, which include documentation, are at http://genes.med.virginia.edu/ of the University of Virginia and at http://genex.csbc.vcu.edu/ of the Virginia Commonwealth University.",
