summary: cysteines disulfide bonding state and connectivity predictor
description: >
   'disulfinder' is for predicting the disulfide bonding state of cysteines
   and their disulfide connectivity starting from sequence alone. Disulfide
   bridges play a major role in the stabilization of the folding process for
   several proteins. Prediction of disulfide bridges from sequence alone is
   therefore useful for the study of structural and functional properties
   of specific proteins. In addition, knowledge about the disulfide bonding
   state of cysteines may help the experimental structure determination
   process and may be useful in other genomic annotation tasks.
   .
   'disulfinder' predicts disulfide patterns in two computational stages:
   (1) the disulfide bonding state of each cysteine is predicted by a
   BRNN-SVM binary classifier; (2) cysteines that are known to participate
   in the formation of bridges are paired by a Recursive Neural Network
   to obtain a connectivity pattern.
