description: EBImage provides general purpose functionality for image processing and
  analysis. In the context of (high-throughput) microscopy-based cellular assays,
  EBImage offers tools to segment cells and extract quantitative cellular descriptors.
  This allows the automation of such tasks using the R programming language and facilitates
  the use of other tools in the R environment for signal processing, statistical modeling,
  machine learning and visualization with image data.
