    "description": "Comparison of beamformer implementations for MEG source localization.\n\nAbstract Beamformers are applied for estimating spatiotemporal characteristics of neuronal sources underlying measured MEG EEG signals. Several MEG analysis toolboxes include an implementation of a linearly constrained minimum-variance (LCMV) beamformer. However, differences in implementations and in their results complicate the selection and application of beamformers and may hinder their wider adoption in research and clinical use. Additionally, combinations of different MEG sensor types (such as magnetometers and planar gradiometers) and application of preprocessing methods for interference suppression, such as signal space separation (SSS), can affect the results in different ways for different implementations.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'LCMV', 'beamformer', 'LCMV beamformer', 'Beamformers'",
