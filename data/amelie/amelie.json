    "description": "AMELIE 2 speeds up Mendelian diagnosis by matching patient phenotype & genotype to primary literature.\n\nAbstract The diagnosis of Mendelian disorders requires labor-intensive literature research. Trained clinicians can spend hours looking for the right publication s supporting a single gene that best explains a patient\u2019s disease. AMELIE ( A utomatic Me ndelian Li terature E valuation) greatly accelerates this process. AMELIE parses all 29 million PubMed abstracts, downloads and further parses hundreds of thousands of full text articles in search of information supporting the causality and associated phenotypes of any published genetic variant. AMELIE then prioritizes patient candidate variants for their likelihood of explaining any patient\u2019s given set of phenotypes. Diagnosis of singleton patients (without relatives\u2019 exomes) is the most time-consuming scenario.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AMELIE 2', 'AMELIE-based evaluation'",
