Although fungal genome sequencing and assembly have become trivial, its annotation procedure has not been standardized yet. Results: FunGAP predicts protein-coding genes in a fungal genome assembly. To attain highquality gene models, this program runs multiple gene predictors, evaluates all predicted genes, and assembles gene models that are highly supported by homology to known sequences. To do this, we built a scoring function to estimate the congruency of each gene model based on known protein or domain homology. Availability and implementation: FunGAP is written in Python script and is available in GitHub (https://github.com/CompSynBioLab-KoreaUniv/FunGAP).
