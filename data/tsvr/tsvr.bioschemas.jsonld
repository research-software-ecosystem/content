      "sc:description": "A new variance ratio metric to detect the timescale of compensatory dynamics | Abstract Understanding the mechanisms governing ecological stability why a property such as primary productivity is stable in some communities and variable in others has long been a focus of ecology. Compensatory dynamics, in which anti-synchronous fluctuations between populations buffer against fluctuations at the community level, is a key theoretical mechanism of stability. Classically, compensatory dynamics have been quantified using a “variance ratio” approach that compares the ratio between community variance and aggregate population variance, such that a lower ratio indicates compensation and a higher ratio indicates synchrony among species fluctuations",
