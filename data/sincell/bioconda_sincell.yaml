description: Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of hierarchical
  intermediate cell-states that might be captured by single-cell RNA seq. Existing
  computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies from single-cell
  data might be formalized under a general workflow composed of i) a metric to assess
  cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality reduction step),
  and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of a cells-clustering
  step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox allowing flexible workflows
  under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes new algorithms to provide
  cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while accounting for stochastic
  factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations and functional association
  tests are provided to interpret hierarchies.
