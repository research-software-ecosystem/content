about:
  description: Cell differentiation processes are achieved through a continuum of
    hierarchical intermediate cell-states that might be captured by single-cell RNA
    seq. Existing computational approaches for the assessment of cell-state hierarchies
    from single-cell data might be formalized under a general workflow composed of
    i) a metric to assess cell-to-cell similarities (combined or not with a dimensionality
    reduction step), and ii) a graph-building algorithm (optionally making use of
    a cells-clustering step). Sincell R package implements a methodological toolbox
    allowing flexible workflows under such framework. Furthermore, Sincell contributes
    new algorithms to provide cell-state hierarchies with statistical support while
    accounting for stochastic factors in single-cell RNA seq. Graphical representations
    and functional association tests are provided to interpret hierarchies.
