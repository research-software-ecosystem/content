However, the lack of training data (i.e. annotated corpora) makes it difficult for machine learning-based named entity recognizers to be used in building practical information extraction systems. Results: This paper presents an active learning-like framework for reducing the human effort required to create named entity annotations in a corpus. In this framework, the annotation work is performed as an iterative and interactive process between the human annotator and a probabilistic named entity tagger. Unlike active learning, our framework aims to annotate all occurrences of the target named entities in the given corpus, so that the resulting annotations are free from the sampling bias which is inevitable in active learning approaches. Conclusion: We evaluate our framework by simulating the annotation process using two named entity corpora and show that our approach can reduce the number of sentences which need to be examined by the human annotator. The cost reduction achieved by the framework could be drastic when the target named entities are sparse. \u00a9 2008 Tsuruoka et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Tsuruoka Y."}, {"name": "Tsujii J."}, {"name": "Ananiadou S."}], "date": "2008-11-19T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yoshimasa Tsuruoka", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yoshimasa.tsuruoka@manchester.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:acela", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.nactem.ac.uk/acela/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Text annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3778"}, {"term": "Data handling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}, {"term": "Named-entity and concept recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3280"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool that aims to reduce the human effort required to produce a gold standard corpus of named entity (NE) annotations.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "acela", "additionDate": "2017-05-01T17:09:02Z", "name": "ACELA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.nactem.ac.uk/acela/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
