Typically, this search is performed using a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), also known as a position weight matrix. In this paper we analyze a set of eukaryotic transcription factor binding sites and show that there is extensive clustering of similar k-mers in eukaryotic motifs, owing to both functional and evolutionary constraints. The apparent limitations of probabilistic models in representing complex nucleotide dependencies lead us to a graph-based representation of motifs. When deciding whether a candidate k-mer is part of a motif or not, we base our decision not on how well the k-mer conforms to a model of the motif as a whole, but how similar it is to specific, known k-mers in the motif. We elucidate the reasons why we expect graph-based methods to perform well on motif data. Our MotifScan algorithm shows greatly improved performance over the prevalent PSSM-based method for the detection of eukaryotic motifs. \u00a9 2006 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 19, "authors": [{"name": "Naughton B.T."}, {"name": "Fratkin E."}, {"name": "Batzoglou S."}, {"name": "Brutlag D.L."}], "date": "2006-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://batzogloulab.stanford.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:motifscan", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://motifscan.stanford.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Motif scanning", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0239"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "MotifScan is a non-parametric DNA motif scanning algorithm.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/motifscan-dna-motif-scanning.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "motifscan", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:09:31Z", "name": "MotifScan", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
