description: For curve, surface and function fitting with an emphasis on splines,
  spatial data and spatial statistics. The major methods include cubic, and thin plate
  splines, Kriging and compact covariances for large data sets. The splines and Kriging
  methods are supported by functions that can determine the smoothing parameter (nugget
  and sill variance) and other covariance parameters by cross validation and also
  by restricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging there is an easy to use function that
  also estimates the correlation scale (range).  A major feature is that any covariance
  function implemented in R and following a simple fields format can be used for spatial
  prediction. There are also many useful functions for plotting and working with spatial
  data as images. This package also contains an implementation of sparse matrix methods
  for large spatial data sets and currently requires the sparse matrix (spam) package.
  Use help(fields) to get started and for an overview.  The fields source code is
  deliberately commented and provides useful explanations of numerical details in
  addition to the manual pages. The commented source code can be viewed by expanding
  the source code file (ending in tar.gz) and looking in the R subdirectory. Please
  cite fields along with its DOI in your publications!
