                "abstract": "IEEERecent advances in RNA-seq technology have made identification of expressed genes affordable, and thus boosting repaid development of transcriptomic studies. Transcriptome assembly, reconstructing all expressed transcripts from RNA-seq reads, is an essential step to understand genes, proteins, and cell functions. Transcriptome assembly remains a challenging problem due to complications in splicing variants, expression levels, uneven coverage and sequencing errors. Here, we formulate the transcriptome assembly problem as path extraction on splicing graphs (or assembly graphs), and propose a novel algorithm MultiTrans for path extraction using mixed integer linear programming. MultiTrans is able to take into consideration coverage constraints on vertices and edges, the number of paths and the paired-end information simultaneously. We benchmarked MultiTrans against two state-of-the-art transcriptome assemblers, TransLiG and rnaSPAdes. Experimental results show that MultiTrans generates more accurate transcripts compared to TransLiG (using the same splicing graphs) and rnaSPAdes (using the same assembly graphs).
