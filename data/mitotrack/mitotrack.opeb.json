Investigating the timing of transcriptional activation, which is a highly stochastic phenomenon, requires the analysis of large amounts of data. In order to perform automatic image analysis of transcriptional activation, we developed a software that segments and tracks both small and large objects, leading the user from raw data up to the results in their final form. RESULTS:MitoTrack is a user-friendly open-access integrated software that performs the specific dual task of reporting the precise timing of transcriptional activation while keeping lineage tree history for each nucleus of a living developing embryo.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:MitoTrack', 'RESULTS:MitoTrack'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31580394","name":"MitoTrack"}}
