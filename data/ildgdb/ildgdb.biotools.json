    "description": "A manually curated database of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and drug information for interstitial lung diseases.\n\nILDGDB is a manually curated database that provides comprehensive experimentally supported associations between genes and interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). The current version of ILDGDB incorporates 20 ILDs and over 600 genes obtained from 3000 articles in four species. The database consists of 5 sections: regulation of mRNA level (1082 entries, more than 450 genes), regulation of protein level (391 entries, more than 200 genes), variants (425 entries, more than 100 genes), drug information (35 entries, 29 genes) and knockout information (85 entries, 72 genes).",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020, The Author(s).Background: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), a diverse group of diffuse lung diseases, mainly affect the lung parenchyma. The low-throughput \u2018omics\u2019 technologies (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) and relative drug information have begun to reshaped our understanding of ILDs, whereas, these data are scattered among massive references and are difficult to be fully exploited. Therefore, we manually mined and summarized these data at a database (ILDGDB, http://ildgdb.org/) and will continue to update it in the future. Main body: The current version of ILDGDB incorporates 2018 entries representing 20 ILDs and over 600 genes obtained from over 3000 articles in four species. Each entry contains detailed information, including species, disease type, detailed description of gene (e.g. official symbol of gene), and the original reference etc. ILDGDB is free, and provides a user-friendly web page. Users can easily search for genes of interest, view their expression pattern and detailed information, manage genes sets and submit novel ILDs-gene association. Conclusion: The main principle behind ILDGDB\u2019s design is to provide an exploratory platform, with minimum filtering and interpretation, while making the presentation of the data very accessible, which will provide great help for researchers to decipher gene mechanisms and improve the prevention, diagnosis and therapy of ILDs.",
