Because their direct measurement is often infeasible, speciation modeling is widely adopted. Mercury (Hg) is a representative pollutant for which study of its speciation benefits from modeling. However, Hg speciation modeling is often hindered by a lack of reliable thermodynamic constants. Although computational chemistry (e.g., density functional theory [DFT]) can generate these constants, methods for directly coupling DFT and speciation modeling are not available. Here, we combine computational chemistry and continuum-scale modeling with curated online databases to ameliorate the problem of unreliable inputs to Hg speciation modeling. Our AQUA-MER databases and web server (https://aquamer.ornl.gov) provides direct speciation results by combining web-based interfaces to a speciation calculator, databases of thermodynamic constants, and a computational chemistry toolkit to estimate missing constants. Although Hg is presented as a concrete use case, AQUA-MER can also be readily applied to other elements. \u00a9 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",
