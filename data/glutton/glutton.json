Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation Many proteins are partially disordered in physiological conditions and only fold, fully or partially, upon binding. Their structural analysis is challenging because the accessible information, typically chemical shifts (CS) from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, are averages over broad ensembles of conformations. We aim to develop a database for the analysis of such data in terms of conformational distributions of the protein backbone rather than of individual high-resolution structures. Results Glutton is the largest available database linking CS and protein 3D structures (5270 entries organized in three levels) and is searchable via a python script. It generates statistical distributions of \u03c6-\u03c8 dihedral angles based on CS or vice versa. Such \u03c6-\u03c8 distributions are used to calculate structural ensembles of partially disordered proteins from their CS. For folded proteins, such ensembles are excellent starting points for further refinement with additional experimental restraints (structure determination) or computational methods (structure prediction).", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "He Y."}, {"name": "Nagpal S."}, {"name": "Sadqi M."}, {"name": "De Alba E."}, {"name": "Munoz V."}], "date": "2019-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Yi He", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yeeho2010@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:Glutton", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/YeeHo/Glutton", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure assignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0320"}, {"term": "Protein geometry calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0249"}, {"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-04T17:51:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for generating structural ensembles of partly disordered proteins from chemical shifts.", "toolType": ["Script"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/YeeHo/Glutton/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}], "biotoolsID": "Glutton", "additionDate": "2019-07-04T17:51:45Z", "name": "Glutton", "license": "Unlicense", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/YeeHo/Glutton/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
