Features and user interface", "abstract": "Although two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) computer analysis software packages have existed ever since 2-DE technology was developed, it is only now that the hardware and software technology allows large-scale studies to be performed on low-cost personal computers or workstations, and that setting up a 2-DE computer analysis system in a small laboratory is no longer considered a luxury. After a first attempt in the seventies and early eighties to develop 2-DE analysis software systems on hardware that had poor or even no graphical capabilities, followed in the late eighties by a wave of innovative software developments that were possible thanks to new graphical interface standards such as XWindows, a third generation of 2-DE analysis software packages has now come to maturity. It can be run on a variety of low-cost, general-purpose personal computers, thus making the purchase of a 2-DE analysis system easily attainable for even the smallest laboratory that is involved in proteome research. Melanie II 2-D PAGE, developed at the University Hospital of Geneva, is such a third-generation software system for 2-DE analysis. Based on unique image processing algorithms, this user-friendly object-oriented software package runs on multiple platforms, including Unix, MS-Windows 95 and NT, and Power Macintosh. It provides efficient spot detection and quantitation, state-of-the-art image comparison, statistical data analysis facilities, and is Internet-ready. Linked to proteome databases such as those available on the World Wide Web, it represents a valuable tool for the 'Virtual Lab' of the post-genome area.", "citationCount": 131, "authors": [{"name": "Appel R.D."}, {"name": "Palagi P.M."}, {"name": "Walther D."}, {"name": "Vargas J.R."}, {"name": "Sanchez J.-C."}, {"name": "Ravier F."}, {"name": "Pasquali C."}, {"name": "Hochstrasser D.F."}], "date": "1997-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Electrophoresis"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "melanie-support@isb-sib.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:melanie", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["8"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://world-2dpage.expasy.org/melanie/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "2D PAGE image", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0942"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Image analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3443"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-06-26T10:27:21Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Offers a unique and flexible interface for the comprehensive visualization, exploration and analysis of 2D gel data.
