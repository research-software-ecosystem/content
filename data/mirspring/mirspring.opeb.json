In this article, we present miRNA Sequence Profiling (miRspring) (http://mirspring.victorchang.edu.au), a software solution that creates a small portable research document that visualizes, calculates and reports on the complexities of miRNA processing. We designed an index-compression algorithm that allows the miRspring document to reproduce a complete miRNA sequence data set while retaining a small file size (typically <3 MB). Through analysis of 73 public data sets, we demonstrate miRspring's features in assessing quality parameters, miRNA cluster expression levels and miRNA processing. Additionally, we report on a new class of miRNA variants, which we term seed-isomiRs, identified through the novel visualization tools of the miRspring document. Further investigation identified that ∼30% of human miRBase entries are likely to have a seed-isomiR. We believe that miRspring will be a highly useful research tool that will enhance the analysis of miRNA data sets and thus increase our understanding of miRNA biology. © 2013 The Author(s).","authors":["Humphreys D.T.","Suter C.M."],"cit_count":22,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkt485","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"MiRspring: A compact standalone research tool for analyzing miRNA-seq data","type":"Primary","year":"2013-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mirspring","biotoolsID":"mirspring","description":"The product of this pipeline creates a miRspring document, which essentiallyis a small HTML javascript file.
