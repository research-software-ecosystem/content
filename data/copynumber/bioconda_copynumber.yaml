description: Penalized least squares regression is applied to fit piecewise constant
  curves to copy number data to locate genomic regions of constant copy number. Procedures
  are available for individual segmentation of each sample, joint segmentation of
  several samples and joint segmentation of the two data tracks from SNP-arrays. Several
  plotting functions are available for visualization of the data and the segmentation
  results.
