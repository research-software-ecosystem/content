    "description": "The TRAX Light-Rail Train Air Quality Observation Project.\n\n- Department of Atmospheric Sciences.\n\nDepartment of Atmospheric Sciences.\n\nCollege of Mines and Earth Sciences.\n\nMonitoring Air Quality Along UTA TRAX Lines.\n\nWe have partnered with UTA TRAX to deploy sensors onboard TRAX light rail train cars to observe variations in pollutants (ozone and particulate matter, PM2.5) and greenhouse gases (methane and carbon dioxide) across the Salt Lake Valley. A pilot project began in 2014 that is now supported by the Utah Division of Air Quality to observe and visualize pollutant concentrations continuously on light rail cars on all three TRAX lines (Red, Green, and Blue). From the data collected, we are able to detect distinct spatial patterns and temporal variations year-round.\n\nEXAMPLE CASES outside nowDATA ACCESS/DOWNLOADPUBLICATIONS & NEWS.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TRAX Observation', 'TRAX Light-Rail Train Air Quality', 'TRAX Light-Rail', 'TRAX Light-Rail Train Air'",
