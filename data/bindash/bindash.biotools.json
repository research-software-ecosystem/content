In the near future, we may need to estimate pairwise distances between millions of genomes. Even with the use of cloud computing, very few softwares can perform such estimation. Results: The multi-threaded software BinDash can perform such estimation using only a typical personal laptop. BinDash implemented b-bit one-permutation rolling MinHash with optimal densification, an existing data-mining technique. BinDash empirically outperforms the state-of-the- A rt software in terms of precision, compression ratio, memory usage and runtime according to our evaluation. Our evaluation is performed with a Dell Inspiron 157 559 Notebook on all bacterial genomes in RefSeq.",
