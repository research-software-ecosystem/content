                "abstract": "Developments of the PDB-REDO procedure that combine re-refinement and rebuilding within a unique decision-making framework to improve structures in the PDB are presented. PDB-REDO uses a variety of existing and custom-built software modules to choose an optimal refinement protocol (e.g. anisotropic, isotropic or overall B-factor refinement, TLS model) and to optimize the geometry versus data-refinement weights. Next, it proceeds to rebuild side chains and peptide planes before a final optimization round. PDB-REDO works fully automatically without the need for intervention by a crystallographic expert. The pipeline was tested on 12 000 PDB entries and the great majority of the test cases improved both in terms of crystallographic criteria such as R free and in terms of widely accepted geometric validation criteria. It is concluded that PDB-REDO is useful to update the otherwise static structures in the PDB to modern crystallographic standards. The publically available PDB-REDO database provides better model statistics and contributes to better refinement and validation targets. \u00a9 International Union of Crystallography 2012.",

However, the coordinates in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) have not all been obtained using the latest experimental and computational methods. In this study a method is presented for automated re-refinement of existing structure models in the PDB. A large-scale benchmark with 16 807 PDB entries showed that they can be improved in terms of fit to the deposited experimental X-ray data as well as in terms of geometric quality. The re-refinement protocol uses TLS models to describe concerted atom movement. The resulting structure models are made available through the PDB-REDO databank (http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/pdb-redo/). Grid computing techniques were used to overcome the computational requirements of this endeavour. \u00a9 2009 International Union of Crystallography.",

Automated gradient refinement is an effective method to achieve this goal, but real-space intervention is most often required in order to adequately address problems detected by structure-validation software. In order to improve the existing protocol, automated re-refinement was combined with structure validation and difference-density peak analysis to produce a catalogue of problems in PDB entries that are amenable to automatic correction. It is shown that re-refinement can be effective in producing improvements, which are often associated with the systematic use of the TLS parameterization of B factors, even for relatively new and high-resolution PDB entries, while the accompanying manual or semi-manual map analysis and fitting steps show good prospects for eventual automation. It is proposed that the potential for simultaneous improvements in methods and in re-refinement results be further encouraged by broadening the scope of depositions to include refinement metadata and ultimately primary rather than reduced X-ray data.",

Inherent protein flexibility, poor or low-resolution diffraction data or poorly defined electron-density maps often inhibit the building of complete structural models during X-ray structure determination. However, recent advances in crystallographic refinement and model building often allow completion of previously missing parts. This paper presents algorithms that identify regions missing in a certain model but present in homologous structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and 'graft' these regions of interest. These new regions are refined and validated in a fully automated procedure. Including these developments in the PDB-REDO pipeline has enabled the building of 24 962 missing loops in the PDB. The models and the automated procedures are publicly available through the PDB-REDO databank and webserver. More complete protein structure models enable a higher quality public archive but also a better understanding of protein function, better comparison between homologous structures and more complete data mining in structural bioinformatics projects.",

Crystallographic structure models in the PDB (more than 100,000 entries) are optimized against the crystal diffraction data and geometrical restraints. This process of crystallographic refinement typically ignored hydrogen bond (H-bond) distances as a source of information. However, H-bond restraints can improve structures at low resolution where diffraction data are limited. To improve low-resolution structure refinement, we present methods for deriving H-bond information either globally from well-refined high-resolution structures from the PDB-REDO databank, or specifically from on-the-fly constructed sets of homologous high-resolution structures. Refinement incorporating HOmology DErived Restraints (HODER), improves geometrical quality and the fit to the diffraction data for many low-resolution structures. To make these improvements readily available to the general public, we applied our new algorithms to all crystallographic structures in the PDB: using massively parallel computing, we constructed a new instance of the PDB-REDO databank (https://pdb-redo.eu). This resource is useful for researchers to gain insight on individual structures, on specific protein families (as we demonstrate with examples), and on general features of protein structure using data mining approaches on a uniformly treated dataset.",

These structures, some >30 years old, were constructed with methods of their era. With PDB_REDO, we aim to automatically optimize these structures to better fit their corresponding experimental data, passing the benefits of new methods in crystallography on to a wide base of non-crystallographer structure users. Results: We developed new algorithms to allow automatic rebuilding and remodeling of main chain peptide bonds and side chains in crystallographic electron density maps, and incorporated these and further enhancements in the PDB_REDO procedure. Applying the updated PDB_REDO to the oldest, but also to some of the newest models in the PDB, corrects existing modeling errors and brings these models to a higher quality, as judged by standard validation methods. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.

Today, many aspects of protein structures are understood better than 10 years ago, and combined with improved software and more computing power, the automated PDB-REDO procedure can significantly improve about 85% of all X-ray structures ever deposited in the PDB. We review structure validation, structure improvement, and a series of validation resources and facilities that give access to improved PDB files and to reports on the quality of the original and the improved structures. Post-deposition optimisation generally leads to improved protein structures and a series of examples will illustrate how that, in turn, leads to improved or even novel biological insights.",

All rights reserved.N-Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications and is implicated in, for example, protein folding and interaction with ligands and receptors. N-Glycosylation trees are complex structures of linked carbohydrate residues attached to asparagine residues. While carbohydrates are typically modeled in protein structures, they are often incomplete or have the wrong chemistry. Here, new tools are presented to automatically rebuild existing glycosylation trees, to extend them where possible, and to add new glycosylation trees if they are missing from the model. The method has been incorporated in the PDB-REDO pipeline and has been applied to build or rebuild 16 452 carbohydrate residues in 11 651 glycosylation trees in 4498 structure models, and is also available from the PDB-REDO web server. With better modeling of N-glycosylation, the biological function of this important modification can be better and more easily understood.",
