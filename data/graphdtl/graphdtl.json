One of the issues with reconciliation approaches is that an exponential number of optimal scenarios is possible. The resulting complexity is masked by the fact that a majority of reconciliation software pick up a random optimal solution that is returned to the end-user. However, the alternative solutions should not be ignored since they tell different stories that parsimony considers as viable as the output solution. In this paper, we describe a polynomial space and time algorithm to build a minimum reconciliation graph-a graph that summarizes the set of all most parsimonious reconciliations. Amongst numerous applications, it is shown how this graph allows counting the number of non-equivalent most parsimonious reconciliations. \u00a9 2013 Imperial College Press.", "citationCount": 25, "authors": [{"name": "Scornavacca C."}, {"name": "Paprotny W."}, {"name": "Berry V."}, {"name": "Ranwez V."}], "date": "2013-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "C\u00e9line Scornavacca", "url": "http://www.ibc-montpellier.fr/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:graphdtl", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/MBB/subsection/downloads.php?section=all&from_sft=0&nb_sft=100#sft_accordion65", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Phylogenetic tree comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0325"}, {"term": "Phylogenetic tree analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0324"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The first method to infer supports for evolutionary events based on their frequencies in the set of equally parsimonious reconciliations\nGiven a , this program computes", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/graphdtl-graph-reconciliation-for-species-tree-s-and-gene-tree-g.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "graphdtl", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:45:38Z", "name": "GraphDTL", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://celinescornavacca.wordpress.com/software/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
