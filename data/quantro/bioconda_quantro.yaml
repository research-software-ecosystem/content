description: A data-driven test for the assumptions of quantile normalization using
  raw data such as objects that inherit eSets (e.g. ExpressionSet, MethylSet). Group
  level information about each sample (such as Tumor / Normal status) must also be
  provided because the test assesses if there are global differences in the distributions
  between the user-defined groups.
