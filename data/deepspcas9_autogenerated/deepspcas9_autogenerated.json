    "description": "deep learning-based model with high generalization performance.\n\nWe evaluated SpCas9 activities at 12,832 target sequences using a high-throughput approach based on a human cell library containing single-guide RNA-encoding and target sequence pairs. Deep learning-based training on this large dataset of SpCas9-induced indel frequencies led to the development of a SpCas9 activity-predicting model named DeepSpCas9. When tested against independently generated datasets (our own and those published by other groups), DeepSpCas9 showed high generalization performance. DeepSpCas9 is available at http: deepcrispr.info DeepSpCas9.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/DeepSpCas9.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SpCas9 activity prediction DeepSpCas9'",
