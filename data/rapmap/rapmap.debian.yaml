  description: rapid sensitive and accurate DNA read mapping via quasi-mapping
  long_description: " RapMap is a testing ground for ideas in quasi-mapping / (lightweight\
    \ /\n pseudo) transcriptome alignment. That means that, at this point, it is\n\
    \ somewhat experimental. The develop branch will have the latest\n improvements\
    \ and additions, but is not guaranteed to be stable between\n commits. Breaking\
    \ changes to the master branch will be accompanied by a\n tag to the version before\
    \ the breaking change. Currently, RapMap is a\n stand-alone quasi-mapper that\
    \ can be used with other tools. It is also\n being used as part of Sailfish and\
    \ Salmon. Eventually, the hope is to\n create and stabilize an API so that it\
    \ can be used as a library from\n other tools.\n .\n Quasi-mapping / (lightweight\
    \ / pseudo)-alignment is the term that is\n used here for the type of information\
    \ required for certain tasks (e.g.\n transcript quantification) that is less \"\
    heavyweight\" than what is\n provided by traditional alignment. For example, one\
    \ may only need to\n know the transcripts / contigs to which a read aligns and,\
    \ perhaps, the\n position within those transcripts rather than the optimal alignment\
    \ and\n base-for-base CIGAR string that aligns the read and substring of the\n\
    \ transcript. For details on RapMap (quasi-mapping in particular), please\n check\
    \ out the associated paper. Note: RapMap implements both quasi-\n mapping and\
    \ pseudo-alignment (originally introduced in Bray et al.\n 2016), these two are\
    \ not the same thing. They are distinct concepts, and\n RapMap simply happens\
    \ to implement algorithms for computing both.\n"
