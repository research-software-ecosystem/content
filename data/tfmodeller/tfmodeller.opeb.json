Some of these interactions have been experimentally described at atomic scale, but the molecular details of many others remain to be discovered. TFmodeller exploits the current knowledge about protein-DNA interfaces contained in the Protein Data Bank and uses it to model similar interfaces related by homology. Results are emailed to the user and include an evolutionary contact matrix, a schematic representation of the putative binding interface and atomic coordinates of the modelled complex. The library of complexes used by TFmodeller is updated on a weekly basis and is available for download. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press.
