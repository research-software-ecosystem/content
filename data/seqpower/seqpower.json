Power analysis and sample size estimation for sequence-based RV association studies are challenging because of the necessity to realistically model the underlying allelic architecture of complex diseases within a suitable analytical framework to assess the performance of a variety of RV association methods in an unbiased manner. Summary: We developed SEQPower, a software package to perform statistical power analysis for sequence-based association data under a variety of genetic variant and disease phenotype models. It aids epidemiologists in determining the best study design, sample size and statistical tests for sequence-based association studies. It also provides biostatisticians with a platform to fairly compare RV association methods and to validate and assess novel association tests. \u00a9 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Wang G.T."}, {"name": "Li B."}, {"name": "Lyn Santos-Cortez R.P."}, {"name": "Peng B."}, {"name": "Leal S.M."}], "date": "2014-08-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://github.com/gaow/SEQPower/issues", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "gaow@uchicago.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:seqpower", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.org/spower/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A tool that provides statistical power analysis and sample size estimation for sequence-based association studies.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/seqpower-3-14159-power-analysis-for-sequence-based-association-studies.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "seqpower", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:59:27Z", "name": "SEQPower", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinformatics.org/spower/docs", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
