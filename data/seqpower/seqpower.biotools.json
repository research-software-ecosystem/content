                "abstract": "Motivation: Statistical methods have been developed to test for complex trait rare variant (RV) associations, in which variants are aggregated across a region, which is typically a gene. Power analysis and sample size estimation for sequence-based RV association studies are challenging because of the necessity to realistically model the underlying allelic architecture of complex diseases within a suitable analytical framework to assess the performance of a variety of RV association methods in an unbiased manner. Summary: We developed SEQPower, a software package to perform statistical power analysis for sequence-based association data under a variety of genetic variant and disease phenotype models. It aids epidemiologists in determining the best study design, sample size and statistical tests for sequence-based association studies. It also provides biostatisticians with a platform to fairly compare RV association methods and to validate and assess novel association tests. \u00a9 The Author 2014.",
