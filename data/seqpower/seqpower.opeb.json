Power analysis and sample size estimation for sequence-based RV association studies are challenging because of the necessity to realistically model the underlying allelic architecture of complex diseases within a suitable analytical framework to assess the performance of a variety of RV association methods in an unbiased manner. Summary: We developed SEQPower, a software package to perform statistical power analysis for sequence-based association data under a variety of genetic variant and disease phenotype models. It aids epidemiologists in determining the best study design, sample size and statistical tests for sequence-based association studies. It also provides biostatisticians with a platform to fairly compare RV association methods and to validate and assess novel association tests. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Wang G.T.","Li B.","Lyn Santos-Cortez R.P.","Peng B.","Leal S.M."],"cit_count":6,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24778108","title":"Power analysis and sample size estimation for sequence-based association studies","year":"2014-08-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:seqpower","biotoolsID":"seqpower","description":"A tool that provides statistical power analysis and sample size estimation for sequence-based association studies.","homepage":"http://bioinformatics.org/spower/","name":"SEQPower"}}
