However, the therapy is time-consuming and requires high expertise. To facilitate the treatment, we reveal an algorithm for the automated generation of patient individual NAM devices for neonates with bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) and present results of software validation. METHODS:The algorithm was implemented utilizing Python 2.7 and Blender 2.78a based on 17 digitized (3D-scanning) impressions of maxillae with BCLP",
