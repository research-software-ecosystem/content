Affymetrix GeneChip arrays are the most popular. In this technology each gene is typically represented by a set of 11-20 pairs of probes. In order to obtain expression measures it is necessary to summarize the probe level data. Using two extensive spike-in studies and a dilution study, we developed a set of tools for assessing the effectiveness of expression measures. We found that the performance of the current version of the default expression measure provided by Affymetrix Microarray Suite can be significantly improved by the use of probe level summaries derived from empirically motivated statistical models. In particular, improvements in the ability to detect differentially expressed genes are demonstrated.", "citationCount": 3565, "authors": [{"name": "Irizarry R.A."}, {"name": "Bolstad B.M."}, {"name": "Collin F."}, {"name": "Cope L.M."}, {"name": "Hobbs B."}, {"name": "Speed T.P."}], "date": "2003-02-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/biostatistics/4.2.249", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Primary", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Exploration, normalization, and summaries of high density oligonucleotide array probe level data.", "abstract": "In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.", "citationCount": 7023, "authors": [{"name": "Irizarry R.A."}, {"name": "Hobbs B."}, {"name": "Collin F."}, {"name": "Beazer-Barclay Y.D."}, {"name": "Antonellis K.J."}, {"name": "Scherf U."}, {"name": "Speed T.P."}], "date": "2003-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Biostatistics (Oxford, England)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bmbolstad.com/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": [], "name": "Terrence Speed", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5403-7998", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "terry@wehi.edu.au"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rmaexpress", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.1.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Microarray data analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-16T12:49:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Compute gene expression summary values for Affymetrix Genechip\u00ae data using the Robust Multichip Average expression summary and carry out quality assessment using probe-level metrics.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/rmaexpress-1-0-5-generate-rma-expression-measures-affy-data.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "rmaexpress", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:11:46Z", "name": "RMAExpress", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/RMAExpress_UsersGuide.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
