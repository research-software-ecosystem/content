    "description": "Identifying Common Genes, Cell Types and Brain Regions Between Diseases of the Nervous System.\n\nBackground: Diseases of the nervous system are widely considered to be caused by genetic mutations, and they have been shown to share pathogenic genes. Discovering the shared mechanisms of these diseases is useful for designing common treatments. Method: In this study, by reviewing 518 articles published after 2007 on 20 diseases of the nervous system, we compiled data on 1607 mutations occurring in 365 genes, totals that are 1.9 and 3.2 times larger than those collected in the Clinvar database, respectively. A combination with the Clinvar data gives 2434 pathogenic mutations and 424 genes. Using this information, we measured the genetic similarities between the diseases according to the number of genes causing two diseases simultaneously. Further detection was carried out on the similarity between diseases in terms of cell types.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Clinvar', 'DMN'",
