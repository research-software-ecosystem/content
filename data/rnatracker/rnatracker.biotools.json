    "description": "Prediction of mRNA subcellular localization using deep recurrent neural networks | RNATracker is a deep learning approach to learn mRNA subcellular localization patterns and to infer its outcome. It operates on the cDNA of the longest isoformic protein-coding transcript of a gene with or without its corresponding secondary structure annnotations. The learning targets are fractions/percentage of the transcripts being localized to a fixed set of subcellular compartments of interest",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Messenger RNA subcellular localization mechanisms play a crucial role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. This trafficking is mediated by trans-acting RNA-binding proteins interacting with cis-regulatory elements called zipcodes. While new sequencing-based technologies allow the high-throughput identification of RNAs localized to specific subcellular compartments, the precise mechanisms at play, and their dependency on specific sequence elements, remain poorly understood. Results: We introduce RNATracker, a novel deep neural network built to predict, from their sequence alone, the distributions of mRNA transcripts over a predefined set of subcellular compartments. RNATracker integrates several state-of-the-art deep learning techniques (e.g. CNN, LSTM and attention layers) and can make use of both sequence and secondary structure information. We report on a variety of evaluations showing RNATracker's strong predictive power, which is significantly superior to a variety of baseline predictors. Despite its complexity, several aspects of the model can be isolated to yield valuable, testable mechanistic hypotheses, and to locate candidate zipcode sequences within transcripts.",
