summary: near-optimal RNA-Seq quantification
description: >
   Kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts from
   RNA-Seq data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput
   sequencing reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for
   rapidly determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the
   need for alignment. On benchmarks with standard RNA-Seq data, kallisto
   can quantify 30 million human reads in less than 3 minutes on a Mac
   desktop computer using only the read sequences and a transcriptome index
   that itself takes less than 10 minutes to build. Pseudoalignment of
   reads preserves the key information needed for quantification, and
   kallisto is therefore not only fast, but also as accurate than existing
   quantification tools. In fact, because the pseudoalignment procedure is
   robust to errors in the reads, in many benchmarks kallisto significantly
   outperforms existing tools.
