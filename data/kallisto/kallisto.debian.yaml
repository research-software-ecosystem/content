  description: near-optimal RNA-Seq quantification
  long_description: " Kallisto is a program for quantifying abundances of transcripts\
    \ from\n RNA-Seq data, or more generally of target sequences using high-throughput\n\
    \ sequencing reads. It is based on the novel idea of pseudoalignment for\n rapidly\
    \ determining the compatibility of reads with targets, without the\n need for\
    \ alignment. On benchmarks with standard RNA-Seq data, kallisto\n can quantify\
    \ 30 million human reads in less than 3 minutes on a Mac\n desktop computer using\
    \ only the read sequences and a transcriptome index\n that itself takes less than\
    \ 10 minutes to build. Pseudoalignment of\n reads preserves the key information\
    \ needed for quantification, and\n kallisto is therefore not only fast, but also\
    \ as accurate than existing\n quantification tools. In fact, because the pseudoalignment\
    \ procedure is\n robust to errors in the reads, in many benchmarks kallisto significantly\n\
    \ outperforms existing tools.\n"
