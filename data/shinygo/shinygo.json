    "description": "a graphical enrichment tool for animals and plants.\n\nMOTIVATION:Gene lists are routinely produced from various genome-wide studies. Enrichment analysis can link these gene lists with underlying molecular pathways and functional categories such as gene ontology (GO) and other databases. RESULTS:To complement existing tools, we developed ShinyGO based on a large annotation database derived from Ensembl and STRING-db for 59 plant, 256 animal, 115 archaeal, and 1678 bacterial species. ShinyGO's novel features include graphical visualization of enrichment results and gene characteristics, and application program interface (API) access to KEGG and STRING for the retrieval of pathway diagrams and protein-protein interaction networks. ShinyGO is an intuitive, graphical web application that can help researchers gain actionable insights from gene lists. AVAILABILITY:http: ge-lab.org go. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
