Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Tag density plots are very important to intuitively reveal biological phenomena from capture-based sequencing data by visualizing the normalized read depth in a region. Results: We have developed iTagPlot to compute tag density across functional features in parallel using multicores and a grid engine and to interactively explore it in a graphical user interface. It allows us to stratify features by defining groups based on biological function and measurement, summary statistics and unsupervised clustering.","authors":["Kim S.-H.","Ezenwoye O.","Cho H.-G.","Robertson K.D.","Choi J.-H."],"cit_count":0,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25792550","title":"ITagPlot: An accurate computation and interactive drawing tool for tag density plot","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:itagplot","biotoolsID":"itagplot","description":"Tool to accurately compute and interactively visualize tag density (read coverage)from genomic sequencing data.","homepage":"http://sourceforge.net/projects/itagplot/","name":"iTagPlot"}}
