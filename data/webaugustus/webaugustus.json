Gene finding programs have achieved relatively high accuracy on short genomic sequences but do not perform well on longer sequences with an unknown number of genes in them. Here existing programs tend to predict many false exons. Results: We have developed a new program, AUGUSTUS, for the ab initio prediction of protein coding genes in eukaryotic genomes. The program is based on a Hidden Markov Model and integrates a number of known methods and submodels. It employs a new way of modeling intron lengths. We use a new donor splice site model, a new model for a short region directly upstream of the donor splice site model that takes the reading frame into account and apply a method that allows better GC-content dependent parameter estimation. AUGUSTUS predicts on longer sequences far more human and drosophila genes accurately than the ab initio gene prediction programs we compared it with, while at the same time being more specific.

The web server allows the user to impose constraints on the predicted gene structure. A constraint can specify the position of a splice site, a translation initiation site or a stop codon. Furthermore, it is possible to specify the position of known exons and intervals that are known to be exonic or intronic sequence. The number of constraints is arbitrary and constraints can be combined in order to pin down larger parts of the predicted gene structure. The result then is the most likely gene structure that complies with all given user constraints, if such a gene structure exists. The specification of constraints is useful when part of the gene structure is known, e.g. by expressed sequence tag or protein sequence alignments, or if the user wants to change the default prediction.
