about:
  description: The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes and
    a set of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists
    in R. Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like objects
    as concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a few low-level concrete
    subclasses of general interest (e.g. DataFrame, Rle, Factor, and Hits) are implemented
    in the S4Vectors package itself (many more are implemented in the IRanges package
    and in other Bioconductor infrastructure packages).
