biotools_id: s4vectors
description: The S4Vectors package defines the Vector and List virtual classes and
  a set of generic functions that extend the semantic of ordinary vectors and lists
  in R. Package developers can easily implement vector-like or list-like objects as
  concrete subclasses of Vector or List. In addition, a few low-level concrete subclasses
  of general interest (e.g. DataFrame, Rle, and Hits) are implemented in the S4Vectors
  package itself (many more are implemented in the IRanges package and in other Bioconductor
  infrastructure packages).
