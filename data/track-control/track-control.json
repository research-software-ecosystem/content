    "description": "automatic video-based real-time closed-loop behavioral control toolbox.\n\nAbstract Approaches of optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity have boosted our understanding of the functional architecture of brain circuits underlying various behaviors. In the meantime, rapid development in computer vision greatly accelerates the automation of behavioral analysis. Real-time and event-triggered interference is often necessary for establishing a tight correlation between neuronal activity and behavioral outcome. However, it is time consuming and easily causes variations when performed manually by experimenters. Here, we describe our Track-Control toolbox, a fully automated system with real-time object detection and low latency closed-loop hardware feedback.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
