A site distribution is the probability distribution of used amino acids at a specific site in the alignment. Consequently, site distributions are are points in 20-dimensional space with elements summing up to 1.0.\n\nEmpirical distribution mixture models assume that evolution occurs along a species tree according to a mixture of amino acid substitution models.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'UDM', 'across-site', 'IQ-TREE' (bio.tools/iq-tree), 'Phylobayes'","homepage":"https://github.com/dschrempf/edcluster","name":"EDCluster"}}
