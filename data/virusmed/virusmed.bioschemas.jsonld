Like Google maps organizes and annotates points of interest on the planet, virus-M-E-D (Metal binding sites, antigenic Epitopes, and Drug binding sites) recognizes the relative locations of individual hotspots of viral proteins, and depicts a collection of maps upon which newly-characterized functional sites can be marked as they are being discovered. While we define drug as small molecule compounds collected by the DrugBank database, other small molecules binders observed in complex viral protein structures were also cataloged.",
