description: The package implements a method for normalising microarray intensities,
  and works for single- and multiple-color arrays. It can also be used for data from
  other technologies, as long as they have similar format. The method uses a robust
  variant of the maximum-likelihood estimator for an additive-multiplicative error
  model and affine calibration. The model incorporates data calibration step (a.k.a.
  normalization), a model for the dependence of the variance on the mean intensity
  and a variance stabilizing data transformation. Differences between transformed
  intensities are analogous to "normalized log-ratios". However, in contrast to the
  latter, their variance is independent of the mean, and they are usually more sensitive
  and specific in detecting differential transcription.
