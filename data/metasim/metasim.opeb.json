Next-generation sequencing technologies are producing a rapid increase of environmental data in public databases. There is great need for specialized software solutions and statistical methods for dealing with complex metagenome data sets. Methodology/Principal Findings: To facilitate the development and improvement of metagenomic tools and the planning of metagenomic projects, we introduce a sequencing simulator called MetaSim. Our software can be used to generate collections of synthetic reads that reflect the diverse taxonomical composition of typical metagenome data sets. Based on a database of given genomes, the program allows the user to design a metagenome by specifying the number of genomes present at different levels of the NCBI taxonomy, and then to collect reads from the metagenome using a simulation of a number of different sequencing technologies. A population sampler optionally produces evolved sequences based on source genomes and a given evolutionary tree. Conclusions/Significance: MetaSim allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software. © 2008 Richter et al.","authors":["Richter D.C.","Ott F.","Auch A.F.","Schmid R.","Huson D.H."],"cit_count":285,"journal":"PLoS ONE","pmid":"18841204","title":"MetaSim - A sequencing simulator for genomics and metagenomics","year":"2008-10-08"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:metasim","biotoolsID":"metasim","description":"The software can be used to generate collections of synthetic reads.","homepage":"http://www-ab.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/software/metasim","name":"MetaSim"}}
