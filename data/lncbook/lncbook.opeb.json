However, these lncRNAs are poorly annotated compared to protein-coding genes, posing great challenges for a better understanding of their functional significance and elucidating their complex functioning molecular mechanisms. Here we employ both community and expert curation to yield a comprehensive collection of human lncRNAs and their annotations. Specifically, LncRNAWiki (http://lncrna.big.ac.cn/index.php/Main_Page) uses a wiki-based community curation model, thus showing great promise in dealing with the flood of biological knowledge, while LncBook (http://bigd.big.ac.cn/lncbook) is an expert curation–based database that provides a complement to LncRNAWiki. LncBook features a comprehensive collection of human lncRNAs and a systematic curation of lncRNAs by multi-omics data integration, functional annotation, and disease association. These protocols provide step-by-step instructions on how to browse and search a specific lncRNA and how to obtain a range of related information including expression, methylation, variation, function, and disease association. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","authors":["Ma L.","Cao J.","Liu L.","Li Z.","Shireen H.","Pervaiz N.","Batool F.","Raza R.Z.","Zou D.","Bao Y.","Abbasi A.A.","Zhang Z."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1002/CPBI.82","journal":"Current Protocols in Bioinformatics","pmid":"31524988","title":"Community Curation and Expert Curation of Human Long Noncoding RNAs with LncRNAWiki and LncBook","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:LncBook","biotoolsID":"LncBook","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/3CDB (BIG.AC.CN) | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Main_Page', 'LncRNAWiki' | Community Curation and Expert Curation of Human Long Noncoding RNAs with LncRNAWiki and LncBook | LncBook a curated knowledgebase of human long non-coding RNAs | To facilitate overall investigation of various RNAs, a comprehensive RNA reference dataset was created, including lncRNA annotations from LncBook and other RNAs’annotations derived from GENCODE v31","homepage":"http://bigd.big.ac.cn/lncbook","name":"LncBook"}}
