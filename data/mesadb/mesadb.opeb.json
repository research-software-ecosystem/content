The database primarily comprises mature microRNA sequences and their target data, along with selected human, mouse and zebrafish expression data sets. mESAdb analysis modules allow (i) mining of microRNA expression data sets for subsets of microRNAs selected manually or by motif; (ii) pair-wise multivariate analysis of expression data sets within and between taxa; and (iii) association of microRNA subsets with annotation databases, HUGE Navigator, KEGG and GO. The use of existing and customized R packages facilitates future addition of data sets and analysis tools. Furthermore, the ability to upload and analyze user-specified data sets makes mESAdb an interactive and expandable analysis tool for microRNA sequence and expression data. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Kaya K.D.","Karakulah G.","Yakicier C.M.","Acar A.C.","Konu O."],"cit_count":30,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21177657","title":"MESAdb: MicroRNA expression and sequence analysis database","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mesadb","biotoolsID":"mesadb","description":"microRNA expression and sequence analysis database is a database for the multivariate analysis of sequences and expression of microRNAs from multiple taxa.
