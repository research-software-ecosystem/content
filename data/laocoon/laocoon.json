    "description": "a tool for high-throughput automated cell counting | High-throughput image analysis for automatic cell counting | Inspired by the seer from ancient Greek/Roman mythology, Laoco\u00f6n, this package synthesizes different packages and methods available in the field of computer vision to create an automatic and efficient means of counting the number of cells in fluorescently stained Fucci cells | The only way that we can get these quantitative analyses is by actually counting the cells | To put it briefly, Fucci cells are stained with certain fluorescent proteins where a certain color corresponds with a certain part of the cell cycle",
