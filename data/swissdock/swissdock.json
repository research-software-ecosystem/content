The prediction of such interactions at the molecular level, by so-called docking software, is a non-trivial task. Docking programs have a wide range of applications ranging from protein engineering to drug design. This article presents SwissDock, a web server dedicated to the docking of small molecules on target proteins. It is based on the EADock DSS engine, combined with setup scripts for curating common problems and for preparing both the target protein and the ligand input files. An efficient Ajax/HTML interface was designed and implemented so that scientists can easily submit dockings and retrieve the predicted complexes. For automated docking tasks, a programmatic SOAP interface has been set up and template programs can be downloaded in Perl, Python and PHP. The web site also provides an access to a database of manually curated complexes, based on the Ligand Protein Database. A wiki and a forum are available to the community to promote interactions between users. The SwissDock web site is available online at http://www.swissdock.ch. We believe it constitutes a step toward generalizing the use of docking tools beyond the traditional molecular modeling community. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 445, "authors": [{"name": "Grosdidier A."}, {"name": "Zoete V."}, {"name": "Michielin O."}], "date": "2011-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.swissdock.ch/pages/feedback", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Olivier.Michielin@isb-sib.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:swissdock", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.swissdock.ch/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Structure visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0570"}, {"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}, {"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:40:36Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Protein ligand docking server, accessible via the ExPASy web server, and based on EADock DSS.
