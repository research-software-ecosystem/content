Therefore, we introduce WinBioinfTools, an open source toolkit containing a number of bioinformatics tools running under Windows High Performance Computing Server 2008. The current version contains three programs for biological sequence analysis: 1) CoCoNUT for pairwise genome comparison, 2) WinBLAST for biological database search, and 3) WinPSA for global pairwise sequence alignment. We show how the Linux/Unix components of these programs were ported to run underWindows.We also demonstrate by experiments the advantage of using a computer cluster compared to a single machine, highlighting the benefits of using the Windows HPC Cluster 2008. Furthermore, we compare the performance of WinBioinfTools on the Windows- and Linux Cluster. © 2009 IEEE.","authors":["Mohamed H.","Abouelhoda M."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1109/CLUSTR.2009.5289141","journal":"Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing, ICCC","title":"WinBioinfTools: Bioinformatics tools for windows cluster","type":"Primary","year":"2009-12-21"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:winbioinftools","biotoolsID":"winbioinftools","description":"Bioinformatics Tools for Windows Cluster provides: 1) CoCoNUT for pairwise genome comparison, 2) parallel BLAST for biological database search, and 3) parallel global pairwise sequence alignment  running over Windows Cluster running Windows HPC server 2008.","homepage":"http://winbioinftools.codeplex.com/","name":"WinBioinfTools","version":["1.0"]}}
