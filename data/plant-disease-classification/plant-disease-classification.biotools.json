    "description": "A Matlab code to classify the type of disease using SVM. A Matlab code is written to classify the type of disease affected leaf. Here I have considered two different types of diseases, i.e 'Anthranose' & 'Blackspot'. Segmentation of the disease affected area was performed by K means clustering. Over 13 different statistical and texture based features are extracted.",
