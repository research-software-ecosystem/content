      "sc:description": "It is used for fast and efficient eQTL mapping in homozygous inbred populations with binary allele calls. It exploits the discrete nature and structure of the measured single nucleotide polymorphisms. SNPs are organized into a Hamming distance-based tree. Its tree can be used to perform both single marker mapping and haplotype association mapping over an m-SNP window. These performance enhancements also permit permutation-based significance testing.",
