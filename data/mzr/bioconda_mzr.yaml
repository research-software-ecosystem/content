description: mzR provides a unified API to the common file formats and parsers available
  for mass spectrometry data. It comes with a wrapper for the ISB random access parser
  for mass spectrometry mzXML, mzData and mzML files. The package contains the original
  code written by the ISB, and a subset of the proteowizard library for mzML and mzIdentML.
  The netCDF reading code has previously been used in XCMS.
