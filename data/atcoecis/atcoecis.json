This guilt-by-association principle can be applied to define modular gene programs, identify cis-regulatory elements, or predict gene functions for unknown genes based on their coexpression neighborhood. We evaluated the potential to use Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment of a gene's coexpression neighborhood as a tool to predict its function but found overall low sensitivity scores (13%-34%). This indicates that for many functional categories, coexpression alone performs poorly to infer known biological gene functions. However, integration of cis-regulatory elements shows that 46% of the gene coexpression neighborhoods are enriched for one or more motifs, providing a valuable complementary source to functionally annotate genes. Through the integration of coexpression data, GO annotations, and a set of known cis-regulatory elements combined with a novel set of evolutionarily conserved plant motifs, we could link many genes and motifs to specific biological functions. Application of our coexpression framework extended with cis-regulatory element analysis on transcriptome data from the cell cycle-related transcription factor OBP1 yielded several coexpressed modules associated with specific cis-regulatory elements. Moreover, our analysis strongly suggests a feed-forward regulatory interaction between OBP1 and the E2F pathway. The ATCOECIS resource (http:// bioinformatics.psb. ugent.be/ATCOECIS/) makes it possible to query coexpression data and GO and cis-regulatory element annotations and to submit user-defined gene sets for motif analysis, providing an access point to unravel the regulatory code underlying transcriptional control in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). \u00a9 2009 American Society of Plant Biologists.", "citationCount": 139, "authors": [{"name": "Vandepoele K."}, {"name": "Quimbaya M."}, {"name": "Casneuf T."}, {"name": "De Veylder L."}, {"name": "Van Peer Y.D."}], "date": "2009-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Plant Physiology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "PSB", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Klaas Vandepoele", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "klaas.vandepoele@psb.vib-ugent.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:atcoecis", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/ATCOECIS/", "function": [{"note": "Cis-regulatory element analysis of Arabidopsis genes", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Identifier", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0842"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0313"}, {"term": "Transcriptional regulatory element prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0438"}, {"term": "Gene to pathway mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0533"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence accession (nucleic acid)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1097"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Identify coexpressed genes or gene coexpression neighborhoods associated with cis-regulatory motifs or GO categories.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "atcoecis", "additionDate": "2016-01-31T16:33:44Z", "name": "ATCOECIS", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/ATCOECIS/faq.htpl", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
