To assist in understanding the flexible protein-ligand interactions, we constructed the Pocketome, an encyclopedia of about one thousand experimentally solved conformational ensembles of druggable binding sites in proteins, grouped by location and consistent chain/cofactor composition. The multiplicity of pockets within the ensembles adds an extra, fourth dimension to the Pocketome entry data. Within each ensemble, the pockets were carefully classified by the degree of their pairwise similarity and compatibility with different ligands. The core of the Pocketome is derived regularly and automatically from the current releases of the Protein Data Bank and the Uniprot Knowledgebase; this core is complemented by entries built from manually provided seed ligand locations. The Pocketome website (www.pocketome.org) allows searching for the sites of interest, analysis of conformational clusters, important residues, binding compatibility matrices and interactive visualization of the ensembles using the ActiveICM web browser plugin. The Pocketome collection can be used to build multi-conformational docking and 3D activity models as well as to design cross-docking and virtual ligand screening benchmarks. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.", "citationCount": 75, "authors": [{"name": "Kufareva I."}, {"name": "Ilatovskiy A.V."}, {"name": "Abagyan R."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "pocketome@ucsd.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Irina Kufareva", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ikufareva@ucsd.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pocketome", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.pocketome.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}, {"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}, {"term": "Residue distance calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2950"}, {"term": "Protein-ligand docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0482"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "To assist in understanding the flexible protein-ligand interactions, we constructed this tool, an encyclopedia of about one thousand experimentally solved conformational ensembles of druggable binding sites in proteins, grouped by location and consistent chain/cofactor composition.
