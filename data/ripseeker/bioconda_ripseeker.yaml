description: Infer and discriminate RIP peaks from RIP-seq alignments using two-state
  HMM with negative binomial emission probability. While RIPSeeker is specifically
  tailored for RIP-seq data analysis, it also provides a suite of bioinformatics tools
  integrated within this self-contained software package comprehensively addressing
  issues ranging from post-alignments processing to visualization and annotation.
