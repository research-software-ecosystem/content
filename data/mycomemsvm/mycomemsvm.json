Its membrane proteins play a critical role for multidrug-resistance and its tenacious survival ability. Knowing the types of membrane proteins will provide novel insights into understanding their functions and facilitate drug target discovery. In this study, a novel method was developed for predicting mycobacterial membrane protein and their types by using over-represented tripeptides. A total of 295 non-membrane proteins and 274 membrane proteins were collected to evaluate the performance of proposed method. The results of jackknife cross-validation test show that our method achieves an overall accuracy of 93.0% in discriminating between mycobacterial membrane proteins and mycobacterial non-membrane proteins and an overall accuracy of 93.1% in classifying mycobacterial membrane protein types. By comparing with other methods, the proposed method showed excellent predictive performance. Based on the proposed method, we built a predictor, called MycoMemSVM, which is freely available at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/MycoMemSVM. It is anticipated that MycoMemSVM will become a useful tool for the annotation of mycobacterial membrane proteins and the development of anti-mycobacterium drug design. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier B.V.", "citationCount": 63, "authors": [{"name": "Ding C."}, {"name": "Yuan L.-F."}, {"name": "Guo S.-H."}, {"name": "Lin H."}, {"name": "Chen W."}], "date": "2012-11-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Proteomics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Hao Lin", "url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hlin@uestc.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mycomemsvm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/MycoMemSVM", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Transmembrane protein prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0269"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A sequence-based predictor for identifying mycobacterial membrane proteins and their types.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/mycomemsvm-identification-of-mycobacterial-membrane-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "mycomemsvm", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:52:08Z", "name": "MycoMemSVM", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/MycoMem/readme", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
