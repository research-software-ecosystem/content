The analysis of MD trajectories comprises the biophysical characterization of membrane properties or the study of protein-lipid interactions and dynamics. However, there is a lack of automated tools to analyse MD simulations of complex membrane or membrane-protein systems. Here we present MEMBPLUGIN, a plugin for the Visual Molecular Dynamics package that provides algorithms to measure a host of essential biophysical properties in simulated membranes. MEMBPLUGIN features are accessible both through a user-friendly graphical interface and as command-line procedures to be invoked in analysis scripts. © The Author 2014.","authors":["Guixa-Gonzalez R.","Rodriguez-Espigares I.","Ramirez-Anguita J.M.","Carrio-Gaspar P.","Martinez-Seara H.","Giorgino T.","Selent J."],"cit_count":53,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btu037","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"MEMBPLUGIN: Studying membrane complexity in VMD","type":"Primary","year":"2014-05-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:membplugin","biotoolsID":"membplugin","description":"Membrane analysis tool for molecular-dynamics simulations.
