However, many of these programs are compared inadequately to other programs. In most cases, only a small portion of the genome is used to evaluate the program, which is not a realistic setting for whole genome annotation projects. In addition, a common evaluation design to properly compare PPPs is still lacking. Results: We present a large-scale benchmarking study of 17 state-of-the-art PPPs. A multi-faceted evaluation strategy is proposed that can be used as a gold standard for promoter prediction evaluation, allowing authors of promoter prediction software to compare their method to existing methods in a proper way. This evaluation strategy is subsequently used to compare the chosen promoter predictors, and an in-depth analysis on predictive performance, promoter class specificity, overlap between predictors and positional bias of the predictions is conducted. © 2009 The Author(s).","authors":["Abeel T.","Van de Peer Y.","Saeys Y."],"cit_count":45,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btp191","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Toward a gold standard for promoter prediction evaluation","type":"Primary","year":"2009-06-09"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ep3","biotoolsID":"ep3","description":"Identification of the core region of a eukaryotic gene promoter.","homepage":"http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/software/details/EP3","name":"EP3","version":["1"]}}
