However, many of these programs are compared inadequately to other programs. In most cases, only a small portion of the genome is used to evaluate the program, which is not a realistic setting for whole genome annotation projects. In addition, a common evaluation design to properly compare PPPs is still lacking. Results: We present a large-scale benchmarking study of 17 state-of-the-art PPPs. A multi-faceted evaluation strategy is proposed that can be used as a gold standard for promoter prediction evaluation, allowing authors of promoter prediction software to compare their method to existing methods in a proper way. This evaluation strategy is subsequently used to compare the chosen promoter predictors, and an in-depth analysis on predictive performance, promoter class specificity, overlap between predictors and positional bias of the predictions is conducted. \u00a9 2009 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 45, "authors": [{"name": "Abeel T."}, {"name": "Van de Peer Y."}, {"name": "Saeys Y."}], "date": "2009-06-09T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ugent.be", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "yves.vandepeer@psb.vib-ugent.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ep3", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/software/details/EP3", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Genome identifier", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2749"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Promoter prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0440"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence motif (nucleic acid)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2070"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Identification of the core region of a eukaryotic gene promoter.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "ep3", "additionDate": "2016-05-17T10:18:48Z", "name": "EP3", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/ep3/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
