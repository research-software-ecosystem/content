However, accurate interpretation of the spectra in terms of identities and abundances of metabolites can be challenging, in particular in crowded regions with heavy peak overlap. Although a number of computational approaches for this task have recently been proposed, they are not entirely satisfactory in either accuracy or extent of automation. Results: We introduce a probabilistic approach Bayesian Quantification (BQuant), for fully automated database-based identification and quantification of metabolites in local regions of 1H NMR spectra. The approach represents the spectra as mixtures of reference profiles from a database, and infers the identities and the abundances of metabolites by Bayesian model selection. We show using a simulated dataset, a spike-in experiment and a metabolomic investigation of plasma samples that BQuant outperforms the available automated alternatives in accuracy for both identification and quantification. \u00a9 The Author 2011.
