Despite successes in these studies, much of the heritability remains unexplained due to lack of power and low resolution. High-density genotyping arrays can now screen more than 5 million genetic markers. As a result, multiple comparison has become an important issue especially in the era of next-generation sequencing. We propose to use a two-stage maximal segmental score procedure (MSS) which uses region-specific empirical P-values to identify genomic segments most likely harboring the disease gene. We develop scoring systems based on Fisher's P-value combining method to convert locus-specific significance levels into region-specific scores. Through simulations, our result indicated that MSS increased the power to detect genetic association as compared with conventional methods provided type I error was at 5%. We demonstrated the application of MSS on a publicly available case-control dataset of Parkinson's disease and replicated the findings in the literature. MSS provides an efficient exploratory tool for high-density association data in the current era of next-generation sequencing.
