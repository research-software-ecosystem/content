description: "Bayesian inference of phylogeny is based upon a quantity called the\
  \ posterior probability distribution of trees, which is the probability of a tree\
  \ conditioned on the observations. The conditioning is accomplished using Bayes's\
  \ theorem. The posterior probability distribution of trees is impossible to calculate\
  \ analytically; instead, MrBayes uses a simulation technique called Markov chain\
  \ Monte Carlo (or MCMC) to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees.\n"
