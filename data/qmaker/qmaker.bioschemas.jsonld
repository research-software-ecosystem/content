      "sc:description": "Fast and accurate method to estimate empirical models of protein evolution.\n\nAmino acid substitution models play a crucial role in phylogenetic analyses. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed to estimate amino acid substitution models, however, they are typically complicated and slow. In this paper, we propose QMaker, a new ML method to estimate a general time-reversible Q matrix from a large protein dataset consisting of multiple sequence alignments. QMaker combines an efficient ML tree search algorithm, a model selection for handling the model heterogeneity among alignments, and the consideration of rate mixture models among sites",
