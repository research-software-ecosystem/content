description: FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is a very fast and accurate
  software tool to merge paired-end reads from next-generation sequencing experiments.
  FLASH is designed to merge pairs of reads when the original DNA fragments are shorter
  than twice the length of reads. The resulting longer reads can significantly improve
  genome assemblies. They can also improve transcriptome assembly when FLASH is used
  to merge RNA-seq data.
