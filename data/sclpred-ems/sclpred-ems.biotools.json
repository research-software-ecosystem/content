For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: The subcellular location of a protein can provide useful information for protein function prediction and drug design. Experimentally determining the subcellular location of a protein is an expensive and time-consuming task. Therefore, various computer-based tools have been developed, mostly using machine learning algorithms, to predict the subcellular location of proteins. Results: Here, we present a neural network-based algorithm for protein subcellular location prediction. We introduce SCLpred-EMS a subcellular localization predictor powered by an ensemble of Deep N-to-1 Convolutional Neural Networks. SCLpred-EMS predicts the subcellular location of a protein into two classes, the endomembrane system and secretory pathway versus all others, with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.75-0.86 outperforming the other state-of-the-art web servers we tested.
