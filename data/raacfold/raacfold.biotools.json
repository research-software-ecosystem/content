                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Protein structure exhibits greater complexity and diversity than DNA structure, and usually affects the interpretation of the function, interactions and biological annotations. Reduced amino acid alphabets (Raaa) exhibit a powerful ability to decrease protein complexity and identify functional conserved regions, which motivated us to create RaacFold. The RaacFold provides 687 reduced amino acid clusters (Raac) based on 58 reduction methods and offers three analysis tools: Protein Analysis, Align Analysis, and Multi Analysis. The Protein Analysis and Align Analysis provide reduced representations of sequence-structure according to physicochemical similarities and computational biology strategies. With the simplified representations, the protein structure can be viewed more concise and clearer to capture biological insight than the unreduced structure. Thus, the design of artificial protein will be more convenient, and redundant interference is avoided. In addition, Multi Analysis allows users to explore biophysical variation and conservation in the evolution of protein structure and function. This supplies important information for the identification and exploration of the nonhomologous functions of paralogs. Simultaneously, RaacFold provides powerful 2D and 3D rendering performance with advanced parameters for sequences, structures, and related annotations.
