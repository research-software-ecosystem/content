                "abstract": "Many new databases aiming at genes and proteins are developed as more and more species are sequenced. It becomes tedious job to navigate among different data resources, map various IDs, and collect and analyze separate biological knowledge. Current popular databases include Entrez Gene, UniProt, Gene Ontology, EMBL, OMIM, PubMed, KEGG, etc. Based on NCBI and UniProt, BioIDMapper can facilitate cross-referencing between different databases, integrate various ID systems and provide a full practical view from the gene, mRNA and functional level regarding one list of specific IDs. It also provides a graphical managing platform to subset biological IDs, connect to external resources, and summarize mapping results. The package and user documentation are free available at CRAN, the R project's repository of packages, at http://cran.r-project.org/web/ packages/BioIDMapper or http://sourceforge.net/projects/bioidmapper/files. \u00a92010 IEEE.",
