  "sc:description": "This tool annotates a histone modification ChIP-seq peak input file with functionally important genomic features (e.g., genes associated with peaks) based on optimization calculations. It extends the boundaries of every gene in a genome by some distance in DNA base pairs, incorporating cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as enhancers and promoters, as well as downstream elements that are important to the function of the gene relative to an epigenetic histone modification ChIP-seq dataset.",
