description: 'This R package provides tools for the statistical analysis of integrative
  genomic data that involve some combination of: genotypes, high-dimensional intermediate
  traits (e.g., gene expression, protein abundance), and higher-order traits (phenotypes).
  The package includes functions to: (1) construct global linkage maps between genetic
  markers and gene expression; (2) analyze multiple-locus linkage (epistasis) for
  gene expression; (3) quantify the proportion of genome-wide variation explained
  by each locus and identify eQTL hotspots; (4) estimate pair-wise causal gene regulatory
  probabilities and construct gene regulatory networks; and (5) identify causal genes
  for a quantitative trait of interest.'
