description: PhILR is short for Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform. This package
  provides functions for the analysis of compositional data (e.g., data representing
  proportions of different variables/parts). Specifically this package allows analysis
  of compositional data where the parts can be related through a phylogenetic tree
  (as is common in microbiota survey data) and makes available the Isometric Log Ratio
  transform built from the phylogenetic tree and utilizing a weighted reference measure.
