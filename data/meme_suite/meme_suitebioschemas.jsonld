Motifs with/without gaps may be discovered, searched for in DNA and protein databases, compared to other motifs and analyzed for putative function by association with gene ontology terms. MEME is a tool designed for discovering and searching for DNA motifs such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) or protein domains.",
