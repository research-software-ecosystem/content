To perform human activity monitoring, people must be detected and the analysis has to be done according to the information relative to the environment and the context. Available multi-camera datasets furnish videos with few (or none) information of the environment where the network was deployed. The proposed dataset provides multi-camera multi-space video sets along with the complete contextual information of the environment. The dataset regroups 11 video sets (composed of 62 single videos) recorded using 6 indoor cameras deployed on multiple spaces","homepage":"http://wisenet.checksem.fr/#/dataset","name":"WiseNET"}}
