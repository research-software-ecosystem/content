      "sc:description": "An indoor multi-camera multi-space dataset with contextual information and annotations for people detection and tracking.\n\nNowadays, camera networks are part of our every-day life environments, consequently, they represent a massive source of information for monitoring human activities and to propose new services to the building users. To perform human activity monitoring, people must be detected and the analysis has to be done according to the information relative to the environment and the context. Available multi-camera datasets furnish videos with few (or none) information of the environment where the network was deployed. The proposed dataset provides multi-camera multi-space video sets along with the complete contextual information of the environment. The dataset regroups 11 video sets (composed of 62 single videos) recorded using 6 indoor cameras deployed on multiple spaces",
