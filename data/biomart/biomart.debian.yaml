summary: GNU R Interface to BioMart databases (Ensembl, COSMIC, Wormbase and Gramene)
description: >
   In recent years a wealth of biological data has become available in
   public data repositories. Easy access to these valuable data resources
   and firm integration with data analysis is needed for comprehensive
   bioinformatics data analysis. biomaRt provides an interface to a growing
   collection of databases implementing the BioMart software suite
   (http://www.biomart.org). The package enables retrieval of large amounts
   of data in a uniform way without the need to know the underlying
   database schemas or write complex SQL queries. Examples of BioMart
   databases are Ensembl, COSMIC, Uniprot, HGNC, Gramene, Wormbase and
   dbSNP mapped to Ensembl. These major databases give biomaRt users direct
   access to a diverse set of data and enable a wide range of powerful
   online queries from gene annotation to database mining.
