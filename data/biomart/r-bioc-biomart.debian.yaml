  description: GNU R Interface to BioMart databases (Ensembl, COSMIC, Wormbase and
    Gramene)
  long_description: " In recent years a wealth of biological data has become available\
    \ in\n public data repositories. Easy access to these valuable data resources\n\
    \ and firm integration with data analysis is needed for comprehensive\n bioinformatics\
    \ data analysis. biomaRt provides an interface to a growing\n collection of databases\
    \ implementing the BioMart software suite\n (http://www.biomart.org). The package\
    \ enables retrieval of large amounts\n of data in a uniform way without the need\
    \ to know the underlying\n database schemas or write complex SQL queries. Examples\
    \ of BioMart\n databases are Ensembl, COSMIC, Uniprot, HGNC, Gramene, Wormbase\
    \ and\n dbSNP mapped to Ensembl. These major databases give biomaRt users direct\n\
    \ access to a diverse set of data and enable a wide range of powerful\n online\
    \ queries from gene annotation to database mining.\n"
