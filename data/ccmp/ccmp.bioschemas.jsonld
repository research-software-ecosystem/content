      "sc:description": "Software-as-a-service approach for fully-automated microbiome profiling | Microbiome profiling holds great promise for the development of novel disease biomarkers and therapeutics. Next-generation sequencing is currently the preferred method for microbiome data collection and multiple standardized tools, packages, and pipelines have been developed for the purpose of raw data processing and microbial annotation. However, these currently available pipelines come with entry-level barriers such as high-performance hardware, software installation, and sequential command-line scripting that often deter end-users. We thus created Cloud Computing for Microbiome Profiling (CCMP, https: ccmp.usc.edu), a public cloud-based web tool which combines the analytical power of current microbiome analysis platforms with a user-friendly interface",
