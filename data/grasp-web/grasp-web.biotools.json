Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Proteins are essential macromolecules for the maintenance of living systems. Many of them perform their function by interacting with other molecules in regions called binding sites. The identification and characterization of these regions are of fundamental importance to determine protein function, being a fundamental step in processes such as drug design and discovery. However, identifying such binding regions is not trivial due to the drawbacks of experimental methods, which are costly and time-consuming. Here we propose GRaSP-web, a web server that uses GRaSP (Graph-based Residue neighborhood Strategy to Predict binding sites), a residue-centric method based on graphs that uses machine learning to predict putative ligand binding site residues. The method outperformed 6 state-of-the-art residue-centric methods (MCC of 0.61). Also, GRaSP-web is scalable as it takes 10-20 seconds to predict binding sites for a protein complex (the state-of-the-art residue-centric method takes 2-5h on the average). It proved to be consistent in predicting binding sites for bound/unbound structures (MCC 0.61 for both) and for a large dataset of multi-chain proteins (4500 entries, MCC 0.61). GRaSPWeb is freely available at https://grasp.ufv.br.",
