      "sc:description": "Clusters of Colocalized Sequences.\n\nAbstract 0.1 Motivation Potential transcription factor (TF) complexes may be identified by testing whether the binding sequences of individual TF proteins form clusters with each other. These clusters may also indicate TF inhibition due to competitive occupancy of enhancer regions. Genome annotation data containing the coordinates of enhancer sequences is highly accessible via position-weight matrix tools. 0.2 Results An algorithm called CCSeq (Clusters of Colocalized Sequences) was developed for identifying clusters of sequences along a one-dimensional line, such as a chromosome, given genome annotation files and a cut-off distance as inputs.",
