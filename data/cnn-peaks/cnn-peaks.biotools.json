                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020, The Author(s).ChIP-seq is one of the core experimental resources available to understand genome-wide epigenetic interactions and identify the functional elements associated with diseases. The analysis of ChIP-seq data is important but poses a difficult computational challenge, due to the presence of irregular noise and bias on various levels. Although many peak-calling methods have been developed, the current computational tools still require, in some cases, human manual inspection using data visualization. However, the huge volumes of ChIP-seq data make it almost impossible for human researchers to manually uncover all the peaks. Recently developed convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are capable of achieving human-like classification accuracy, can be applied to this challenging problem. In this study, we design a novel supervised learning approach for identifying ChIP-seq peaks using CNNs, and integrate it into a software pipeline called CNN-Peaks. We use data labeled by human researchers who annotate the presence or absence of peaks in some genomic segments, as training data for our model. The trained model is then applied to predict peaks in previously unseen genomic segments from multiple ChIP-seq datasets including benchmark datasets commonly used for validation of peak calling methods. We observe a performance superior to that of previous methods.",
