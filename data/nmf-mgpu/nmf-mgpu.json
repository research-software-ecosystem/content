However, the computing time required to process large data matrices may become impractical, even for a parallel application running on a multiprocessors cluster. Results: NMF-mGPU is based on CUDA(Compute Unified Device Architecture), the NVIDIA's framework for GPU computing. On devices with low memory available, large input matrices are blockwise transferred from the system's main memory to the GPU's memory, and processed accordingly. In addition, NMF-mGPU has been explicitly optimized for the different CUDA architectures. Finally, platforms with multiple GPUs can be synchronized through MPI(Message Passing Interface). In a four-GPU system, this implementation is about 120 times faster than a single conventional processor, and more than four times faster than a single GPU device (i.e., a super-linear speedup). Conclusions: Applications of GPUs in Bioinformatics are getting more and more attention due to their outstanding performance when compared to traditional processors. In addition, their relatively low price represents a highly cost-effective alternative to conventional clusters. In life sciences, this results in an excellent opportunity to facilitate the daily work of bioinformaticians that are trying to extract biological meaning out of hundreds of gigabytes of experimental information. NMF-mGPU can be used \"out of the box\" by researchers with little or no expertise in GPU programming in a variety of platforms, such as PCs, laptops, or high-end GPU clusters.
