summary: Efficient sequence alignment of full genomes
description: >
   MUMmer is a system for rapidly aligning entire genomes, whether
   in complete or draft form. For example, MUMmer 3.0 can find all
   20-basepair or longer exact matches between a pair of 5-megabase genomes
   in 13.7 seconds, using 78 MB of memory, on a 2.4 GHz Linux desktop
   computer. MUMmer can also align incomplete genomes; it handles the 100s
   or 1000s of contigs from a shotgun sequencing project with ease, and
   will align them to another set of contigs or a genome using the NUCmer
   program included with the system. If the species are too divergent for
   DNA sequence alignment to detect similarity, then the PROmer program
   can generate alignments based upon the six-frame translations of both
   input sequences.
