As genome-wide data for mammalian systems are being generated, it is critical to develop network inference methods that can handle tens of thousands of genes efficiently, provide a systematic framework for the integration of multiple data sources, and yield robust, accurate and compact gene-to-gene relationships.Results: We developed and applied ScanBMA, a Bayesian inference method that incorporates external information to improve the accuracy of the inferred network. In particular, we developed a new strategy to efficiently search the model space, applied data transformations to reduce the effect of spurious relationships, and adopted the g-prior to guide the search for candidate regulators. Our method is highly computationally efficient, thus addressing the scalability issue with network inference. The method is implemented as the ScanBMA function in the networkBMA Bioconductor software package.Conclusions: We compared ScanBMA to other popular methods using time series yeast data as well as time-series simulated data from the DREAM competition. We found that ScanBMA produced more compact networks with a greater proportion of true positives than the competing methods. Specifically, ScanBMA generally produced more favorable areas under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall curves than other regression-based methods and mutual-information based methods. In addition, ScanBMA is competitive with other network inference methods in terms of running time. \u00a9 2014 Young et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 45, "authors": [{"name": "Young W.C."}, {"name": "Raftery A.E."}, {"name": "Yeung K.Y."}], "date": "2014-04-17T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ka Yee Yeung", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kayee@u.washington.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:networkbma", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.12.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/networkBMA.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Gene expression data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2603"}, "format": [{"term": "Matrix format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3033"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "RNA-seq time series data analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3565"}, {"term": "Pathway or network visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3083"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Plot", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2884"}, "format": [{"term": "Image format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3547"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Image", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2968"}, "format": [{"term": "Image format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3547"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An extension of Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) for network construction using time series gene expression data.
