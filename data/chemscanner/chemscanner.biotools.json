This can facilitate the reuse of chemical information embedded into diverse documents used as standard storage and communication instrument in chemical sciences (e.g. for student's theses, PhD theses, or publications). The extracted information is processed to reactions, molecules, as well as additional text and values and can be accessed via the ChemScanner UI. ChemScanner supports the export to Excel and CML, the direct import of the extracted data to the Open Source ELN Chemotion or the use via \"copy and paste\" of selected information. The software was designed with a focus on the processing of documents with embedded molecular structure information as CDX or CDXML as these are the most common file formats for chemical drawings. The project aims to support the chemists in their efforts to re-use chemistry research data by providing them missing tools for an automated assembly of reaction data.",
