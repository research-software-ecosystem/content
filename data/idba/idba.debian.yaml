description: "IDBA stands for iterative de Bruijn graph assembler. In computational\
  \ sequence biology, an assembler solves the puzzle coming from large sequencing\
  \ machines that feature many gigabytes of short reads from a large genome. . This\
  \ package provides several flavours of the IDBA assembler, as they all share the\
  \ same source tree but serve different purposes and evolved over time. . IDBA is\
  \ the basic iterative de Bruijn graph assembler for second-generation sequencing\
  \ reads. IDBA-UD, an extension of IDBA, is designed to utilize paired-end reads\
  \ to assemble low-depth regions and use progressive depth on contigs to reduce errors\
  \ in high-depth regions. It is a generic purpose assembler and especially good for\
  \ single-cell and metagenomic sequencing data. IDBA-Hybrid is another update version\
  \ of IDBA-UD, which can make use of a similar reference genome to improve assembly\
  \ result. IDBA-Tran is an iterative de Bruijn graph assembler for RNA-Seq data.\n"
