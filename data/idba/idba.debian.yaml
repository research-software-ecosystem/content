description: IDBA stands for iterative de Bruijn graph assembler. In computational
  sequence biology, an assembler solves the puzzle coming from large sequencing machines
  that feature many gigabytes of short reads from a large genome. . This package provides
  several flavours of the IDBA assembler, as they all share the same source tree but
  serve different purposes and evolved over time. . IDBA is the basic iterative de
  Bruijn graph assembler for second-generation sequencing reads. IDBA-UD, an extension
  of IDBA, is designed to utilize paired-end reads to assemble low-depth regions and
  use progressive depth on contigs to reduce errors in high-depth regions. It is a
  generic purpose assembler and especially good for single-cell and metagenomic sequencing
  data. IDBA-Hybrid is another update version of IDBA-UD, which can make use of a
  similar reference genome to improve assembly result. IDBA-Tran is an iterative de
  Bruijn graph assembler for RNA-Seq data.
