summary: iterative De Bruijn Graph short read assemblers
description: >
   IDBA stands for iterative de Bruijn graph assembler. In computational
   sequence biology, an assembler solves the puzzle coming from large
   sequencing machines that feature many gigabytes of short reads from a
   large genome.
   .
   This package provides several flavours of the IDBA assembler, as they all
   share the same source tree but serve different purposes and evolved over time.
   .
   IDBA is the basic iterative de Bruijn graph assembler for
   second-generation sequencing reads. IDBA-UD, an extension of IDBA,
   is designed to utilize paired-end reads to assemble low-depth regions
   and use progressive depth on contigs to reduce errors in high-depth
   regions. It is a generic purpose assembler and especially good for
   single-cell and metagenomic sequencing data. IDBA-Hybrid is another
   update version of IDBA-UD, which can make use of a similar reference
   genome to improve assembly result. IDBA-Tran is an iterative de Bruijn
   graph assembler for RNA-Seq data.
version: 1.1.3
