However, its use remains usually limited to technically inclined users due to the technical challenges of preparing, launching, and analyzing calculations. In this context, we have developed CalcUS, an open-source platform to streamline quantum chemistry studies. Its objective is to democratize access to computational chemistry by providing a user-friendly web interface to simplify running and analyzing quantum mechanical calculations. It is freely available, expandable, and customizable. It promotes connectivity to multiple software packages and algorithms, thus providing state-of-the-art techniques to all practitioners. We propose CalcUS as a standalone tool and infrastructure to support other open-source packages.",
