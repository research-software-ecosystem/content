This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Since 1817, cholera, caused by Vibrio cholerae, has been characterized by seven distinct pandemics. The ongoing seventh pandemic (7P) began in 1961. In this study, we developed a Multilevel Genome Typing (MGT) tool for classifying the V. cholerae species with a focus on the 7P. MGT is based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), but the concept has been expanded to include a series of MLST schemes that compare population structure from broad to fine resolutions. The V. cholerae MGT consists of eight levels, with the lowest, MGT1, composed of 7 loci and the highest, MGT8, consisting of the 7P core genome (3, 759 loci). We used MGT to analyze 5, 771 V. cholerae genomes. The genetic relationships revealed by lower MGT levels recapitulated previous findings of large-scale 7P transmission across the globe. Furthermore, the higher MGT levels provided an increased discriminatory power to differentiate subgroups within a national outbreak. Additionally, we demonstrated the usefulness of MGT for non-7P classification. In a large non-7P MGT1 type, MGT2 and MGT3 described continental and regional distributions, respectively. Finally, MGT described trends of 7P in virulence, and MGT2 to MGT3 sequence types (STs) grouped isolates of the same ctxB, tcpA, and ctxB-tcpA genotypes and characterized their trends over the pandemic. MGT offers a range of resolutions for typing V. cholerae. The MGT nomenclature is stable, transferable, and directly comparable between investigations. The MGT database (https:// mgtdb.unsw.edu.au/) can accept and process newly submitted samples. MGT allows tracking of existing and new isolates and will be useful for understanding future spread of cholera.",
