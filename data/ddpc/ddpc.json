PC is relatively difficult to diagnose due to a lack of clear early symptoms. Extensive research of PC has led to the availability of a large amount of data on PC. Several hundred genes are implicated in different stages of PC, which may help in developing diagnostic methods or even cures. In spite of this accumulated information, effective diagnostics and treatments remain evasive. We have developed Dragon Database of Genes associated with Prostate Cancer (DDPC) as an integrated knowledgebase of genes experimentally verified as implicated in PC. DDPC is distinctive from other databases in that (i) it provides pre-compiled biomedical text-mining information on PC, which otherwise require tedious computational analyses, (ii) it integrates data on molecular interactions, pathways, gene ontologies, gene regulation at molecular level, predicted transcription factor binding sites on promoters of PC implicated genes and transcription factors that correspond to these binding sites and (iii) it contains DrugBank data on drugs associated with PC. We believe this resource will serve as a source of useful information for research on PC. DDPC is freely accessible for academic and non-profit users via http://apps.sanbi.ac.za/ddpc/ and http://cbrc .kaust.edu.sa/ddpc/. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 31, "authors": [{"name": "Maqungo M."}, {"name": "Kaur M."}, {"name": "Kwofie S.K."}, {"name": "Radovanovic A."}, {"name": "Schaefer U."}, {"name": "Schmeier S."}, {"name": "Oppon E."}, {"name": "Christoffels A."}, {"name": "Bajic V.B."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Vlad Bajic", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "vladimir.bajic@kaust.edu.sa"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ddpc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/ddpc/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2454"}, {"term": "Transcription factor binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0445"}, {"term": "Gene expression profiling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0314"}, {"term": "Promoter prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0440"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Dragon Database of Genes Implicated in Prostate Cancer is a knowledgebase of genes experimentally verified to be involved in prostate cancer (PC).\nDDPC provides gene-associated data such as protein annotation, molecular pathways, ontologies and transcription regulation.
