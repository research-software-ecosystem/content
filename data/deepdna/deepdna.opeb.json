The experiment has shown that out method deepDNA is able to learn sequence local features through a convolutional layer, and to learn higher level representations of long-term sequences dependencies through a long short-term memory network (LSTM) layer. We evaluated the learned genome sequences representations model on human mitochondrial genome sequences compressing tasks and achieved a satisfactory result.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DeepDNA available'","homepage":"https://github.com/rongjiewang/DeepDNA","name":"DeepDNA"}}
