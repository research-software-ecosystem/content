biotools_id: genomegraphs
description: Genomic data analyses requires integrated visualization of known genomic
  information and new experimental data. GenomeGraphs uses the biomaRt package to
  perform live annotation queries to Ensembl and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript
  structures in viewports of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic information
  plotted together with your data.  Another strength of GenomeGraphs is to plot different
  data types such as array CGH, gene expression, sequencing and other data, together
  in one plot using the same genome coordinate system.
