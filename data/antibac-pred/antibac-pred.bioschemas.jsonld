The process may be optimized using (Q)SAR methods based on the accumulated experimental data in the field.\n\nNowadays, data on antibacterial action of chemical compounds are well represented in public domain. ChEMBL database [2], for example, contains records on activity of chemical compounds against 1386 bacteria. We extracted bioactivity records on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chemical compounds from ChEMBL_24 and prepared them as follows:.\n\nantiBac-Pred allows user to predict the fact that chemical compound can inhibit the growth of one or more of 353 bacteria in concentration below the 10000 nM",
