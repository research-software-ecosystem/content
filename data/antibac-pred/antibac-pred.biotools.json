    "description": "A Web Application for Predicting Antibacterial Activity of Chemical Compounds.\n\nPredict Targets for Drawn Structure.\n\nDiscovery of novel antibacterial agents is the high-priority task because the existing therapy do not provide the necessary safety and sufficient long-term efficacy due to the emerging resistance [1]. The process may be optimized using (Q)SAR methods based on the accumulated experimental data in the field.\n\nNowadays, data on antibacterial action of chemical compounds are well represented in public domain. ChEMBL database [2], for example, contains records on activity of chemical compounds against 1386 bacteria. We extracted bioactivity records on minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of chemical compounds from ChEMBL_24 and prepared them as follows:.\n\nantiBac-Pred allows user to predict the fact that chemical compound can inhibit the growth of one or more of 353 bacteria in concentration below the 10000 nM",

Every new drug brings significant improvement to patients with bacterial infections, but prolonged usage of antibacterials leads to the emergence of resistant strains. Therefore, novel active structures with new modes of action are required. We describe a web application called AntiBac-Pred aimed to help users in the rational selection of the chemical compounds for experimental studies of antibacterial activity. This application is developed using antibacterial activity data available in ChEMBL and PASS software. It allows users to classify chemical structures of interest into growth inhibitors or noninhibitors of 353 different bacteria strains, including both resistant and nonresistant ones.",
