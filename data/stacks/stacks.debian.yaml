summary: pipeline for building loci from short-read DNA sequences
description: >
   Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences,
   such as those generated on the Illumina platform. Stacks was developed to work
   with restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq, for the purpose of
   building genetic maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography.
   .
   Note that this package installs Stacks such that all commands must be run as:
   $ stacks <cmdname> <args>
version: 2.41
