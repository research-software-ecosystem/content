It is designed to efficiently phase genomic data by linking sequencing reads across heterozygous sites, extending haplotype blocks, and incorporating pre-phased data when available.\n\nThe full paper detailing the methodology and validation of TinkerHap is available at bioRxiv\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.16.638517.",
