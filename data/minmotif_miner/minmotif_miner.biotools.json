Here we report the third release of the MnM database which has now grown 60-fold to approximately 300 000 minimotifs. Since short minimotifs are by their nature not very complex we also summarize a new set of false-positive filters and linear regression scoring that vastly enhance minimotif prediction accuracy on a test data set.
