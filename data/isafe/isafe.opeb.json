All rights reserved. Most approaches that capture signatures of selective sweeps in population genomics data do not identify the specific mutation favored by selection. We present iSAFE (for \"integrated selection of allele favored by evolution\"), a method that enables researchers to accurately pinpoint the favored mutation in a large region (â 1/45 Mbp) by using a statistic derived solely from population genetics signals. iSAFE does not require knowledge of demography, the phenotype under selection, or functional annotations of mutations.","authors":["Akbari A.","Vitti J.J.","Iranmehr A.","Bakhtiari M.","Sabeti P.C.","Mirarab S.","Bafna V."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4606","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Identifying the favored mutation in a positive selective sweep","year":"2018-04-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:isafe","biotoolsID":"isafe","description":"A program for identifying a favored mutation in positive selective sweep.
