description: A package for gene set analysis based on the variability of expressions
  as well as a method to detect Alternative Splicing Events . It implements DIfferential
  RAnk Conservation (DIRAC) and gene set Expression Variation Analysis (EVA) methods.
  For detecting Differentially Spliced genes, it provides an implementation of the
  Spliced-EVA (SEVA).
