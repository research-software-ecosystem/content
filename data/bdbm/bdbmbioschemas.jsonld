Using these tools you can perform several common tasks such as doing BLAST alignments, getting the open reading frames of the sequences in a Fasta file or changing the format of a Fasta file. All these task make use of several known tools such as EMBOSS, bedtools, and NCBI's BLAST, Splign and Compart.",
