description: RCAS is an automated system that provides dynamic genome annotations
  for custom input files that contain transcriptomic regions. Such transcriptomic
  regions could be, for instance, peak regions detected by CLIP-Seq analysis that
  detect protein-RNA interactions, RNA modifications (alias the epitranscriptome),
  CAGE-tag locations, or any other collection of target regions at the level of the
  transcriptome. RCAS is designed as a reporting tool for the functional analysis
  of RNA-binding sites detected by high-throughput experiments. It takes as input
  a BED format file containing the genomic coordinates of the RNA binding sites and
  a GTF file that contains the genomic annotation features usually provided by publicly
  available databases such as Ensembl and UCSC. RCAS performs overlap operations between
  the genomic coordinates of the RNA binding sites and the genomic annotation features
  and produces in-depth annotation summaries such as the distribution of binding sites
  with respect to gene features (exons, introns, 5'/3' UTR regions, exon-intron boundaries,
  promoter regions, and whole transcripts). Moreover, by detecting the collection
  of targeted transcripts, RCAS can carry out functional annotation tables for enriched
  gene sets (annotated by the Molecular Signatures Database) and GO terms. As one
  of the most important questions that arise during protein-RNA interaction analysis;
  RCAS has a module for detecting sequence motifs enriched in the targeted regions
  of the transcriptome. A full interactive report in HTML format can be generated
  that contains interactive figures and tables that are ready for publication purposes.
