description: A compendium of new geometries, coordinate systems, statistical  transformations,
  scales and fonts for 'ggplot2', including splines, 1d and 2d densities,  univariate
  average shifted histograms, a new map coordinate system based on the  'PROJ.4'-library
  along with geom_cartogram() that mimics the original functionality of  geom_map(),
  formatters for "bytes", a stat_stepribbon() function, increased 'plotly' compatibility
  and the 'StateFace' open source font 'ProPublica'. Further new  functionality includes
  lollipop charts, dumbbell charts, the ability to encircle points and coordinate-system-based
  text annotations.
