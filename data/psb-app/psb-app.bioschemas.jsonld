  "sc:description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PIDS-Score', 'liu-q', 'PIDS-Scores', 'Personalized' | Network-Based Matching of Patients and Targeted Therapies for Precision Oncology* | The extensive acquisition of high-throughput molecular profiling data across model systems (human tumors and cancer cell lines) and drug sensitivity data, makes precision oncology possible allowing clinicians to match the right drug to the right patient. Current supervised models for drug sensitivity prediction, often use cell lines as exemplars of patient tumors and for model training. However, these models are limited in their ability to accurately predict drug sensitivity of individual cancer patients to a large set of drugs, given the paucity of patient drug sensitivity data used for testing and high variability across different drugs. To address these challenges, we developed a multilayer network-based approach to impute individual patients’ responses to a large set of drugs",
