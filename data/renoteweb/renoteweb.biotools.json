                "abstract": "© 2022 Elsevier B.V.The reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing and the total time to perform this process has resulted in a significant increase in the deposit of biological information in public databases such as the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The production of large volumes of data per run has culminated in the need to develop algorithms capable of handling data with this new feature and assisting in analyses such as the assembly and annotation of prokaryotic genomes. Over the years, several pipelines and computational tools have been developed to automate this task and consequently reduce the total time to know the genetic content of a given organism, especially non-model organisms, collaborating with the identification of possible targets with biotechnological applicability. In the case of automatic annotation tools, the accuracy of the results is widely observed in the literature, however, this does not excludes the manual curation process, where the information inferred in the automatic process is verified and enriched by the curators. This task requires a time which is directly proportional to the number of gene products of the target organism under study. To assist in this process, we present the ReNoteWeb web tool, endowed with a simple and intuitive interface, to perform the assembly enhancement process, with the possibility of identifying the missing products in the original genomic sequence. In addition, ReNoteWeb is capable of performing the annotation process for all products, based on information obtained from highly accurate external databases. The engine responsible for performing the data processing was developed in JAVA and the web platform uses the resources of the Yii framework. The annotation produced by this platform aims to reduce the overall time in the manual curation process. Twenty-three organisms were used to validate the tool. The efficiency was verified by comparing the annotation of these same organisms available in the NCBI database and the annotation performed on the RAST platform. The tool is available at: http://biod.ufpa.br/renoteweb/.",
