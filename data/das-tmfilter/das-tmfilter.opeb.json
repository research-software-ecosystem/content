We propose a modification of the dense alignment surface (DAS) method that achieves a substantial decrease in the false positive error rate. Essentially, a sequence that includes possible transmembrane regions is compared in a second step with TM segments in a sequence library of documented transmembrane proteins. If the performance of the query sequence against the library of documented TM segment-containing sequences in this test is lower than an empirical threshold, it is classified as a non-transmembrane protein. The probability of false positive prediction for trusted TM region hits is expressed in terms of E-values. The modified DAS method, the DAS-TMfilter algorithm, has an unchanged high sensitivity for TM segments (∼95% detected in a learning set of 128 documented transmembrane proteins). At the same time, the selectivity measured over a non-redundant set of 526 soluble proteins with known 3D structure is ∼99%, mainly because a large number of falsely predicted single membrane-pass proteins are eliminated by the DAS-TMfilter algorithm.","authors":["Cserzo M.","Eisenhaber F.","Eisenhaber B.","Simon I."],"cit_count":112,"doi":"10.1093/protein/15.9.745","journal":"Protein Engineering","pmid":"12456873","title":"On filtering false positive transmembrane protein predictions","type":"Primary","year":"2002-09-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:das-tmfilter","biotoolsID":"das-tmfilter","description":"DAS (Dense Alignment Surface) is based on low-stringency dot-plots of the query sequence against a set of library sequences - non-homologous membrane proteins - using a previously derived, special scoring matrix.
