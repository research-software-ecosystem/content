  "sc:description": "DAS (Dense Alignment Surface) is based on low-stringency dot-plots of the query sequence against a set of library sequences - non-homologous membrane proteins - using a previously derived, special scoring matrix. The method provides a high precision hyrdophobicity profile for the query from which the location of the potential transmembrane segments can be obtained. The novelty of the DAS-TMfilter algorithm is a second prediction cycle to predict TM segments in the sequences of the TM-library.",
