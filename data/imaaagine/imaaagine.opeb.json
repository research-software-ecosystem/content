A minimal side chain description allows a variety of side chain orientations to exist within the pattern, and generic side chain types such as acid, base and hydroxyl-containing can be additionally deployed in the search query. Moreover, only a subset of distances between the side chains need be specified. We illustrate these capabilities in case studies involving arginine stacks, serine-acid group arrangements and multiple catalytic triad-like configurations.

Users can define an amino acid arrangment of 3 to 8 residues which will be converted into a search pattern. The search using the query is carried out against the PDB. 3D arrangements of amino acids in PDB structures that conform to the query will be returned to the user.","homepage":"http://mfrlab.org/grafss/imaaagine/","name":"IMAAAGINE"}}
