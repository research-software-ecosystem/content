DNA repair is thought to exist in all organisms that have an active metabolism, and repair systems are crucial for repairing many types of DNA damage. External damage includes (but is not limited to) ionizing (UV) radiation, tobacco smoke, and chemical alteration. Examples of internal damage are DNA copying errors, oxygen byproducts resulting from metabolism, and hydrolysis.",
