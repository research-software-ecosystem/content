Over the last 15 years, the GENCODE consortium has been producing reference quality gene annotations to provide this foundational resource. The GENCODE consortium includes both experimental and computational biology groups who work together to improve and extend theGENCODE gene annotation. Specifically, we generate primary data, create bioinformatics tools and provide analysis to support the work of expert manual gene annotators and automated gene annotation pipelines. In addition, manual and computational annotation workflows use any and all publicly available data and analysis, along with the research literature to identify and characterise gene loci to the highest standard. GENCODE gene annotations are accessible via the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers, the Ensembl FTP site, Ensembl Biomart, Ensembl Perl and REST APIs as well as https://www.gencodegenes.org.","authors":["Frankish A.","Diekhans M.","Ferreira A.-M.","Johnson R.","Jungreis I.","Loveland J.","Mudge J.M.","Sisu C.","Wright J.","Armstrong J.","Barnes I.","Berry A.","Bignell A.","Carbonell Sala S.","Chrast J.","Cunningham F.","Di Domenico T.","Donaldson S.","Fiddes I.T.","Garcia Giron C.","Gonzalez J.M.","Grego T.","Hardy M.","Hourlier T.","Hunt T.","Izuogu O.G.","Lagarde J.","Martin F.J.","Martinez L.","Mohanan S.","Muir P.","Navarro F.C.P.","Parker A.","Pei B.","Pozo F.","Ruffier M.","Schmitt B.M.","Stapleton E.","Suner M.-M.","Sycheva I.","Uszczynska-Ratajczak B.","Xu J.","Yates A.","Zerbino D.","Zhang Y.","Aken B.","Choudhary J.S.","Gerstein M.","Guigo R.","Hubbard T.J.P.","Kellis M.","Paten B.","Reymond A.","Tress M.L.","Flicek P."],"cit_count":17,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gky955","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"30357393","title":"GENCODE reference annotation for the human and mouse genomes","type":"Primary","year":"2019-01-08"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:GENCODE","biotoolsID":"GENCODE","description":"Consortium identifying and classifying all gene features in the human and mouse genomes with high accuracy based on biological evidence, and releasing these annotations for the benefit of biomedical research and genome interpretation.","homepage":"https://www.gencodegenes.org/","name":"GENCODE"}}
