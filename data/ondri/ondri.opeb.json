This heterogeneous cross-section of patients with complex neurodegenerative and neurovascular pathologies pose significant challenges for standard neuroimaging tools. To effectively quantify regional measures of normal and pathological brain tissue volumes, the ONDRI neuroimaging platform implemented a semi-automated MRI processing pipeline that was able to address many of the challenges resulting from this heterogeneity.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Ontario Neurodegenerative Disease Research Initiative'","homepage":"http://ondri.ca/","name":"ONDRI"}}
