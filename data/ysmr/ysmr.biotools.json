Video tracking of motile bacteria allows the monitoring of bacterial swimming behaviour and taxis on the level of individual cells, which is a prerequisite to study the underlying molecular mechanisms. Results: The open-source python program YSMR (Your Software for Motility Recognition) was designed to simultaneously track a large number of bacterial cells on standard computers from video files in various formats. In order to cope with the high number of tracked objects, we use a simple detection and tracking approach based on grey-value and position, followed by stringent selection against suspicious data points. The generated data can be used for statistical analyses either directly with YSMR or with external programs. Conclusion: In contrast to existing video tracking software, which either requires expensive computer hardware or only tracks a limited number of bacteria for a few seconds, YSMR is an open-source program which allows the 2-D tracking of several hundred objects over at least 5 minutes on standard computer hardware.
