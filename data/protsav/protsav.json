Quality assessment of predicted model structures of proteins is as important as the protein tertiary structure prediction. A highly efficient quality assessment of predicted model structures directs further research on function. Here we present a new server ProTSAV, capable of evaluating predicted model structures based on some popular online servers and standalone tools. ProTSAV furnishes the user with a single quality score in case of individual protein structure along with a graphical representation and ranking in case of multiple protein structure assessment. The server is validated on \u223c 64,446 protein structures including experimental structures from RCSB and predicted model structures for CASP targets and from public decoy sets. ProTSAV succeeds in predicting quality of protein structures with a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 98% on experimentally solved structures and achieves a specificity of 88%and a sensitivity of 91% on predicted protein structures of CASP11 targets under 2 \u00c5.The server overcomes the limitations of any single server/method and is seen to be robust in helping in quality assessment.
