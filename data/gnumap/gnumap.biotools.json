First, we have created an algorithm that probabilistically maps reads to repeat regions in the genome on a quantitative basis. Second, we have developed a probabilistic Needleman-Wunsch algorithm which utilizes _prb.txt and _int.txt files produced in the Solexa/Illumina pipeline to improve the mapping accuracy for lower quality reads and increase the amount of usable data produced in a given experiment. \u00a9 The Author 2009.
