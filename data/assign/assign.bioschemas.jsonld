  "sc:description": "Tool to evaluate the pathway deregulation/activation status in patient samples. It employs a Bayesian factor analysis approach to adapt predetermined pathway signatures derived from knowledge-based literatures or from perturbation experiments to the cell-/tissue-specific pathway signatures. The deregulation/activation level of each context-specific pathway is quantified to a score, which represents the extent to which a patient sample encompasses the pathway deregulation/activation signature.",
