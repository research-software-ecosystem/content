description: A set of wrappers for individual components of the SC3 package. Functions
  R packages are hard to call when building workflows outside of R, so this package
  adds a set of simple wrappers with robust argument parsing. Intermediate steps are
  currently mainly serialized R objects, but the ultimate objective is to have language-agnostic
  intermediate formats allowing composite workflows using a variety of software packages.
