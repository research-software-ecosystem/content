    "description": "A novel ensemble approach for accurate and robust cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomes | Abstract Background In recent years, the rapid development of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques enables the quantitative characterization of cell types at a single-cell resolution. With the explosive growth of the number of cells profiled in individual scRNA-seq experiments, there is a demand for novel computational methods for classifying newly-generated scRNA-seq data onto annotated labels. Although several methods have recently been proposed for the cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data, such limitations as inadequate accuracy, inferior robustness, and low stability greatly limit their wide applications. Results We propose a novel en semble approach, named EnClaSC, for accurate and robust cell-type cla ssification of s ingle- c ell transcriptomic data",
