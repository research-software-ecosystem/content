With the explosive growth of the number of cells profiled in individual scRNA-seq experiments, there is a demand for novel computational methods for classifying newly-generated scRNA-seq data onto annotated labels. Although several methods have recently been proposed for the cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data, such limitations as inadequate accuracy, inferior robustness, and low stability greatly limit their wide applications. Results: We propose a novel ensemble approach, named EnClaSC, for accurate and robust cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data. Through comprehensive validation experiments, we demonstrate that EnClaSC can not only be applied to the self-projection within a specific dataset and the cell-type classification across different datasets, but also scale up well to various data dimensionality and different data sparsity. We further illustrate the ability of EnClaSC to effectively make cross-species classification, which may shed light on the studies in correlation of different species. EnClaSC is freely available at https://github.com/xy-chen16/EnClaSC. Conclusions: EnClaSC enables highly accurate and robust cell-type classification of single-cell transcriptomic data via an ensemble learning method. We expect to see wide applications of our method to not only transcriptome studies, but also the classification of more general data.",
