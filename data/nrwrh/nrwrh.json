In this paper, the method of Network-based Random Walk with Restart on the Heterogeneous network (NRWRH) is developed to predict potential drug-target interactions on a large scale under the hypothesis that similar drugs often target similar target proteins and the framework of Random Walk. Compared with traditional supervised or semi-supervised methods, NRWRH makes full use of the tool of the network for data integration to predict drug-target associations. It integrates three different networks (protein-protein similarity network, drug-drug similarity network, and known drug-target interaction networks) into a heterogeneous network by known drug-target interactions and implements the random walk on this heterogeneous network. When applied to four classes of important drug-target interactions including enzymes, ion channels, GPCRs and nuclear receptors, NRWRH significantly improves previous methods in terms of cross-validation and potential drug-target interaction prediction. Excellent performance enables us to suggest a number of new potential drug-target interactions for drug development. \u00a9 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.", "citationCount": 179, "authors": [{"name": "Chen X."}, {"name": "Liu M.-X."}, {"name": "Yan G.-Y."}], "date": "2012-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Molecular BioSystems"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Xing Chen", "url": "http://www.aporc.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "xingchen@amss.ac.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:nrwrh", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://doc.aporc.org/wiki/NRWRH", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-11T19:02:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predict the potential target proteins of the given drug.
