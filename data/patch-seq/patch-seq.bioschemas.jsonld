At the Allen Institute we have optimized this technique to efficiently collect high-quality data. On this GitHub repo we provide links to the manuscript describing this optimized technique and associated data, a detailed protocol, Allen Institute manuscripts that have utilized this technique, and links to Allen Institute resources and software. In addition, this repo includes an R package of Patch-seq tools for quality control and cell typing of Patch-seq cells.",
