                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.Matrix-assisted laser desorption\u2013ionization mass spectrometry imaging in transmission-mode geometry (t-MALDI\u2013MSI) can provide molecular information with a pixel size of 1 \u00b5m and smaller, which makes this label-free method highly interesting for characterizing the chemical composition of tissues and cells on a (sub)cellular level. However, a major hindrance for wider use of the technology is the reduced ion abundance at small pixel sizes. Here we mitigate this problem by use of laser-induced post-ionization (MALDI-2) and by adapting a t-MALDI-2 ion source to an Orbitrap mass analyzer. We demonstrate the crucial sensitivity and accuracy boosts that are achieved with this combination by visualizing the distribution of numerous phospho- and glycolipids in mouse cerebellum and kidney slices, and in cultured Vero B4 cells. With brain tissue, a pixel size of 600 nm was achieved. Our method could constitute a valuable new tool for research in cell biology and biomedicine.",
