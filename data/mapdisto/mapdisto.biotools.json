    "description": "MAPDISTO is a program for mapping genetic markers in experimental segregating populations like backcross, doubled haploids, single-seed descent. Its specificity is to propose recombination fraction estimates in case of segregation distortion. It can (1) compute and draw genetic maps easily and quickly through a graphical interface; (2) facilitate the analysis of marker data showing segregation distortion due to differential viability of gametes or zygotes.",

Motivation: Genotyping by sequencing (GBS) generates datasets that are challenging to handle by current genetic mapping software with graphical interface. Geneticists need new user-friendly computer programs that can analyze GBS data on desktop computers. This requires improvements in computation efficiency, both in terms of speed and use of random-access memory (RAM). Results: MapDisto v.2.0 is a user-friendly computer program for construction of genetic linkage maps. It includes several new major features: (i) handling of very large genotyping datasets like the ones generated by GBS; (ii) direct importation and conversion of Variant Call Format (VCF) files; (iii) detection of linkage, i.e. construction of linkage groups in case of segregation distortion; (iv) data imputation on VCF files using a new approach, called LB-Impute. Features i to iv operate through inclusion of new Java modules that are used transparently by MapDisto; (v) QTL detection via a new R/qtl graphical interface.",
