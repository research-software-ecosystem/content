      "sc:description": "BREM-SC is an R package (with core functions jointDIMMSC and BREMSC) for joint clustering droplet-based scRNA-seq and CITE-seq data. jointDIMMSC is developed as a direct extension of DIMMSC, which assumes full indenpendency between single cell RNA and surface protein data. To take the correlation between two data sources into consideration, we further develop BREMSC, which uses random effects to incorporate the two data sources. This package can directly work on raw count data from droplet-based scRNA-seq and CITE-seq experiments without any data transformation, and it can provide clustering uncertainty for each cell.",
