Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.RNA-Seq is gradually becoming the standard tool for transcriptomic expression studies in biological research. Although considerable progress has been recorded in the development of statistical algorithms for the detection of differentially expressed genes using RNA-Seq data, the list of detected genes can differ significantly between algorithms. We present a new method (PANDORA) that combines multiple algorithms toward a summarized result, more efficiently reflecting true experimental outcomes. This is achieved through the systematic combination of several analysis algorithms, by weighting their outcomes according to their performance with realistically simulated data sets generated from real data. Results supported by the analysis of both simulated and real data from different organisms as well as correlation with PolII occupancy demonstrate that PANDORA improves the detection of differential expression. It accomplishes this by optimizing the tradeoff between standard performance measurements, such as precision and sensitivity.", "citationCount": 17, "authors": [{"name": "Moulos P."}, {"name": "Hatzis P."}], "date": "2015-02-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Panagiotis Moulos", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "moulos@fleming.gr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:metaseqr", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.16.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/metaseqR.html", "function": [{"note": "The output is a rich HTML report with various visualizations and links to text tab-delimited file downloads.", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Gene expression matrix", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_3112"}, "format": [{"term": "BAM", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2572"}, {"term": "DSV", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3751"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "RNA-Seq quantification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3800"}, {"term": "Differential gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3223"}, {"term": "Gene expression profiling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0314"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Gene expression matrix", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_3112"}, "format": [{"term": "HTML", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2331"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Provides an interface to several normalization and statistical testing packages for RNA-Seq gene expression data.
