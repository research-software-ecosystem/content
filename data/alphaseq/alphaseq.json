    "description": "Sequence Discovery With Deep Reinforcement Learning.\n\nSequences play an important role in many applications and systems. Discovering sequences with desired properties has long been an interesting intellectual pursuit. This article puts forth a new paradigm, AlphaSeq, to discover desired sequences algorithmically using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. AlphaSeq treats the sequence discovery problem as an episodic symbol-filling game, in which a player fills symbols in the vacant positions of a sequence set sequentially during an episode of the game. Each episode ends with a completely filled sequence set, upon which a reward is given based on the desirability of the sequence set. AlphaSeq models the game as a Markov decision process (MDP) and adapts the DRL framework of AlphaGo to solve the MDP. Sequences discovered improve progressively as AlphaSeq, starting as a novice, and learns to become an expert game player through many episodes of game playing.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
