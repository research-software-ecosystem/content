  "sc:description": "simNGS is software for simulating observations from Illumina sequencing machines using the statistical models behind the AYB base-calling software. By default, observations only incorporate noise due to sequencing and do not incorporate effects from more esoteric sources of noise that may be present in real data (“dust”, bubbles, merged clusters, sequence-heterogeneous clusters, etc). Many of these additional sources may optionally applied.",
