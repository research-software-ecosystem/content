      "sc:description": "ARBitR is an overlap aware genome assembly scaffolder for linked sequencing reads. It is used for merging and scaffolding an existing genome assembly. It takes a position sorted read alignment file in the bam/sam format with 10X Chromium barcodes in the BX tag, and if additionally provided with the genome fasta file used for mapping, it will sort and merge the provided contigs into scaffolds. A key functionality is the possibility to resolve links between contigs by overlap-layout-consensus (OLC) instead of indiscriminately inserting a gap between them.",
