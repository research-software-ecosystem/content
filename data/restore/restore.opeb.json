This often requires compilation of results from multiple samples. Quantitative integration of information between samples is complicated by variations in staining intensity and background fluorescence due to differences in fixation and staining between samples, and other technical artefacts that obscure biological variations. Failure to remove these unwanted artefacts will complicate downstream analysis and diminish the value of multiplexed imaging for clinical applications. Here, we describe a R obust int E n S i T y n OR malization m E thod ( RESTORE ) to compensate for unwanted variations in multiplexed imaging.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'obust'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/792770","name":"RESTORE"}}
