    "description": "UniReD is a Text Mining tool that collects high quality, manually annotated and non-redundant Human or Mouse proteins from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (reviewed). Using a combination of publications that are i. manually assigned to each protein by UniProt and ii.automatically calculated (as related documents) by PubMed, UniReD creates clusters of proteins that are putatively functionally related.",
