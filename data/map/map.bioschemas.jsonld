      "sc:description": "Model-based analysis of proteomic data to detect proteins with significant abundance changes.\n\nMAP (Model-based Analysis of Proteomic data), is designed to statistically compare the proteomic profiles generated from different biological samples using the isotope labeling based mass spectrometry (MS) technique and directly identify proteins with significant abundance changes. Unlike many existing tools for this purpose, it does not require parallel/additional technical replicates to fathom technical variations; instead, MAP uses a novel step-by-step regression analysis to directly model technical variations from the profiles under comparison. Therefore, experimental designs and their expenses can be simplified and reduced for more practices",
