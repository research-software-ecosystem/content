Glycans can be imported in GlycoCT condensed format, or else as IUPAC condensed names, and passed as substrates to the enzymes, which are modeled as regular-expression-based substitutions on strings. The resulting networks of reactions can be exported as SBML. The effects of knocking out different sets of enzyme activities can be compared. A method is provided for predicting the enzymes required to produce a given substrate, using an O-glycan from human gastric mucin as an example. The system has been adapted to other systems of glycosylation enzymes, and an application to ganglioside oligosaccharide synthesis is demonstrated. O-Glycologue is available at https://glycologue.org/o/.",
