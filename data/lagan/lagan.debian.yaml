summary: highly parametrizable pairwise global genome sequence aligner
description: >
   Lagan takes local alignments generated by CHAOS as anchors, and limits
   the search area of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm around these anchors.
   .
   Multi-LAGAN is a generalization of the pairwise algorithm to multiple
   sequence alignment.  M-LAGAN performs progressive pairwise alignments,
   guided by a user-specified phylogenetic tree. Alignments are aligned to
   other alignments using the sum-of-pairs metric.
