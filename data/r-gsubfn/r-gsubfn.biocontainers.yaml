description: gsubfn is like gsub but can take a replacement function or certain other
  objects instead of the replacement string. Matches and back references are input
  to the replacement function and  replaced by the function output.   gsubfn can be
  used to split strings  based on content rather than delimiters and for quasi-perl-style
  string  interpolation. The package also has facilities for translating formulas  to
  functions and allowing such formulas in function calls instead of  functions.  This
  can be used with R functions such as apply, sapply, lapply, optim, integrate, xyplot,
  Filter and any other function that  expects another function as an input argument
  or functions like cat or sql calls that may involve strings where substitution is
  desirable.
