description: "Sigma (\u201CSimple greedy multiple alignment\u201D) is an alignment\
  \ program. It's algorithm and scoring scheme are designed specifically for non-coding\
  \ DNA sequence. . It uses a strategy of seeking the best possible gapless local\
  \ alignments. This happens at each step making the best possible alignment consistent\
  \ with existing alignments. It scores the significance of the alignment based on\
  \ the lengths of the aligned fragments and a background model. These may be supplied\
  \ or estimated from an auxiliary file of intergenic DNA."
