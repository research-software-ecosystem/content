We therefore developed two methods for predicting (i) individual cell cycle TFs and (ii) synergistic TF pairs. The essential idea is that genes regulated by a cell cycle TF should have higher (lower, if it is a repressor) expression levels than genes not regulated by it during one or more phases of the cell cycle. This idea can also be used to identify synergistic interactions of TFs. Applying our methods to chromatin immunoprecipitation data and microarray data, we predict 50 cell cycle TFs and 80 synergistic TF pairs, including most known cell cycle TFs and synergistic TF pairs. Using these and published results, we describe the behaviors of 50 known or inferred cell cycle TFs in each cell cycle phase in terms of activation/repression and potential positive/negative interactions between TFs. In addition to the cell cycle, our methods are also applicable to other functions. \u00a9 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.", "citationCount": 79, "authors": [{"name": "Tsai H.-K."}, {"name": "Lu H.H.-S."}, {"name": "Li W.-H."}], "date": "2005-09-20T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bits.iis.sinica.edu.tw/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tfbsfinder", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bits.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~TFBSfinder/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "It is an identification method that utilizes several data sources.
