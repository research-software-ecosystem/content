A new metric for measuring the degree of conservation at a binding site across species and methods for clustering motifs and for inferring position weight matrices are proposed. For synthetic data and yeast cell cycle TFs, TFBSfinder identifies motifs that are highly similar to known consensuses. Moreover, TFBSfinder outperforms well-known methods.",
