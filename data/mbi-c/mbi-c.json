DESIGN:This was a population-based cohort study. SETTING:Participants were recruited from the Platform for Research Online to Investigate Genetics and Cognition in Aging study (https: www.protect-exeter.org.uk). PARTICIPANTS:A total of 5,742 participant-informant dyads participated in the study. MEASUREMENTS:Both participants and informants completed the MBI-C",

The factor structure of the MBI-C was evaluated by exploratory factor analysis.Results:The most common MBI-C items, as rated by self-reported and informants, related to affective dysregulation (mood/anxiety symptoms), being present in 34% and 38% of the sample, respectively. The least common items were those relating to abnormal thoughts and perception (psychotic symptoms) (present in 3% and 6% of the sample, respectively). Only weak correlations were observed between self-reported and informant-reported MBI-C responses. Exploratory factor analysis for both sets of respondent answers indicated that a five-factor solution for the MBI-C was appropriate, reflecting the hypothesized structure of the MBI-C.Conclusion:This is the largest and most detailed report on the frequency of MBI symptoms in a nondementia sample. The full spectrum of MBI symptoms was present in our sample, whether rated by self-reported or informant report. However, we show that the MBI-C performs differently in self-reported versus informant-reported situations, which may have important implications for the use of the questionnaire in clinic and research.",
