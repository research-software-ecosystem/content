                "abstract": "© 2017 The Author(s).CancerPDF (Cancer Peptidome Database of bioFluids) is a comprehensive database of endogenous peptides detected in the human biofluids. The peptidome patterns reflect the synthesis, processing and degradation of proteins in the tissue environment and therefore can act as a gold mine to probe the peptide-based cancer biomarkers. Although an extensive data on cancer peptidome has been generated in the recent years, lack of a comprehensive resource restrains the facility to query the growing community knowledge. We have developed the cancer peptidome resource named CancerPDF, to collect and compile all the endogenous peptides isolated from human biofluids in various cancer profiling studies. CancerPDF has 14,367 entries with 9,692 unique peptide sequences corresponding to 2,230 unique precursor proteins from 56 high-throughput studies for ~27 cancer conditions. We have provided an interactive interface to query the endogenous peptides along with the primary information such as m/z, precursor protein, the type of cancer and its regulation status in cancer. To add-on, many web-based tools have been incorporated, which comprise of search, browse and similarity identification modules. We consider that the CancerPDF will be an invaluable resource to unwind the potential of peptidome-based cancer biomarkers. The CancerPDF is available at the web address http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/cancerpdf/.",
