    "description": "R package for estimating epigenetic age from Illumina DNA methylation microarray data. THE WID_clocks function uses a methylation beta matrix and returns the WID general, epithelial and immune clocks. It also returns the WID-relative-epithelial-age (WID_rea) and WID-relative-immune-age (WID_ria) (âˆ†WID epithelial or WID immune and WID general clock). \nhttps://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02603-3",
