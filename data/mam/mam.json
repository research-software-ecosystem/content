                "abstract": "MaM is a software tool that processes and manipulates multiple alignments of genomic sequence. MaM computes the exact location of common repeat elements, exons and unique regions within aligned genomics sequences using a variety of user identified programs, databases and/or tables. The program can extract subalignments, corresponding to these various regions of DNA to be analyzed independently or in conjunction with other elements of genomic DNA. Graphical displays further allow an assessment of sequence variation throughout these different regions of the aligned sequence, providing separate displays for their repeat, non-repeat and coding portions of genomic DNA. The program should facilitate the phylogenetic analysis and processing of different portions of genomic sequence as part of large-scale sequencing efforts. MaM source code is freely available for non-commercial use at http:// compbio.cs.sfu.ca/MAM.htm; and the web interface WebMaM is hosted at http://atgc.lirmm.fr/mam. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.",
