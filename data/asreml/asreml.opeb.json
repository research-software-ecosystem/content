Three applications are described. The motivation for the algorithm was the estimation of variance components in the analysis of wheat variety means from 1,071 experiments representing 10 years and 60 locations in New South Wales. We also apply the algorithm to the analysis of designed experiments by incomplete block analysis and spatial analysis of field experiments.","authors":["Gilmour A.R.","Thompson R.","Cullis B.R."],"cit_count":484,"doi":"10.2307/2533274","journal":"Biometrics","title":"Average information REML: An efficient algorithm for variance parameter estimation in linear mixed models","type":"Primary","year":"1995-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:asreml","biotoolsID":"asreml","description":"Fits the general linear mixed model and estimates variance components by residual maximum likelihood (REML).","homepage":"https://asreml.org/","name":"ASReml"}}
