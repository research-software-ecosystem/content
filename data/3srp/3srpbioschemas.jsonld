      "sc:description": "A Snakemake-based pipeline for 3' sequencing RNA profiling data analysis.  This 3â€™ Digital gene expression sequencing technique allows a precise and low-cost transcriptome profiling.\n\nThe main steps of the pipeline are:\n- Samples demultiplexing transform the raw paired-end fastq files into a single-end fastq file for each sample.\n- Alignment on refseq reference transcriptome is performed using bwa.\n- Aligned reads are parsed and UMI are counted for each gene in each sample to create an expression matrix.\nIf secondary analysis has been asked (providing a comparisons file), the expression matrix is normalized and differentially expressed genes (DEG) are searched using deseq2.\n- If DEG are found, annotation is performed using the database GO and KEGG.\n- A report is provided listing the main quality controls performed and the results found.",
