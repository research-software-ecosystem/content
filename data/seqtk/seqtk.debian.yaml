summary: Fast and lightweight tool for processing sequences in the FASTA or FASTQ format
description: >
   Currently, seqtk supports quality based trimming with the phred
   algorithm, converting fastq to fasta, reverse complementing sequences,
   extracting or masking subsequences in regions given in a BED/name list
   file, and more.  It contains a subsampling module to sample exactly n
   sequences or a fraction of sequences.
   .
   Seqtk supports both fasta and fastq input files, which can be
   optionally gzip compressed.
