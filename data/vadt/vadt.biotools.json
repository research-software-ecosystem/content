    "description": "Investigation of allele specific expression in various tissues of broiler chickens using the detection tool VADT.\n\nCurrently the program is in beta-phase and a manuscript drafted for submission. Please feel free to use, but please cite the github for the time period until it is published.\n\nVADT performs various filtering steps of a VCF file before testing for ASE. The first filter performed is removing all variants that have been flagged as failing (FILTER column). Specifically the program looks for a \"PASS\" in the filter column to include that variant in further analysis. VADT removes all variants within a certain distance of an indel defined by the user. VADT also removes all variants with multiple reference and alternative alleles and variants with less than the minimum quality score defined by user.",

                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Differential abundance of allelic transcripts in a diploid organism, commonly referred to as allele specific expression (ASE), is a biologically significant phenomenon and can be examined using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from RNA-seq. Quantifying ASE aids in our ability to identify and understand cis-regulatory mechanisms that influence gene expression, and thereby assist in identifying causal mutations. This study examines ASE in breast muscle, abdominal fat, and liver of commercial broiler chickens using variants called from a large sub-set of the samples (n = 68). ASE analysis was performed using a custom software called VCF ASE Detection Tool (VADT), which detects ASE of biallelic SNPs using a binomial test. On average ~ 174,000 SNPs in each tissue passed our filtering criteria and were considered informative, of which ~ 24,000 (~ 14%) showed ASE. Of all ASE SNPs, only 3.7% exhibited ASE in all three tissues, with ~ 83% showing ASE specific to a single tissue. When ASE genes (genes containing ASE SNPs) were compared between tissues, the overlap among all three tissues increased to 20.1%. Our results indicate that ASE genes show tissue-specific enrichment patterns, but all three tissues showed enrichment for pathways involved in translation.",
