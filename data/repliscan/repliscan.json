Background: Replication timing experiments that use label incorporation and high throughput sequencing produce peaked data similar to ChIP-Seq experiments. However, the differences in experimental design, coverage density, and possible results make traditional ChIP-Seq analysis methods inappropriate for use with replication timing. Results: To accurately detect and classify regions of replication across the genome, we present Repliscan. Repliscan robustly normalizes, automatically removes outlying and uninformative data points, and classifies Repli-seq signals into discrete combinations of replication signatures. The quality control steps and self-fitting methods make Repliscan generally applicable and more robust than previous methods that classify regions based on thresholds. Conclusions: Repliscan is simple and effective to use on organisms with different genome sizes. Even with analysis window sizes as small as 1 kilobase, reliable profiles can be generated with as little as 2.4x coverage.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Zynda G.J."}, {"name": "Song J."}, {"name": "Concia L."}, {"name": "Wear E.E."}, {"name": "Hanley-Bowdoin L."}, {"name": "Thompson W.F."}, {"name": "Vaughn M.W."}], "date": "2017-08-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Matthew W.
