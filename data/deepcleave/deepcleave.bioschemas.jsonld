      "sc:description": "A deep learning predictor for caspase and matrix metalloprotease substrates and cleavage sites | Proteases are enzymes that cleave target substrate proteins by catalyzing the hydrolysis of peptide bonds between specific amino acids. While the functional proteolysis regulated by proteases plays a central role in the 'life and death' process of proteins, many of the corresponding substrates and their cleavage sites were not found yet. Availability of accurate predictors of the substrates and cleavage sites would facilitate understanding of proteases' functions and physiological roles. Deep learning is a promising approach for the development of accurate predictors of substrate cleavage events. RESULTS:We propose DeepCleave, the first deep learning-based predictor of protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites. DeepCleave uses protein substrate sequence data as input and employs convolutional neural networks with transfer learning to train accurate predictive models",
