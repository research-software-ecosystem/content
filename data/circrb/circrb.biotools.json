                "abstract": "© 2021, The Author(s).Background: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are widely expressed in cells and tissues and are involved in biological processes and human diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated that circRNAs can interact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which is considered an important aspect for investigating the function of circRNAs. Results: In this study, we design a slight variant of the capsule network, called circRB, to identify the sequence specificities of circRNAs binding to RBPs. In this model, the sequence features of circRNAs are extracted by convolution operations, and then, two dynamic routing algorithms in a capsule network are employed to discriminate between different binding sites by analysing the convolution features of binding sites. The experimental results show that the circRB method outperforms the existing computational methods. Afterwards, the trained models are applied to detect the sequence motifs on the seven circRNA-RBP bound sequence datasets and matched to known human RNA motifs. Some motifs on circular RNAs overlap with those on linear RNAs. Finally, we also predict binding sites on the reported full-length sequences of circRNAs interacting with RBPs, attempting to assist current studies. We hope that our model will contribute to better understanding the mechanisms of the interactions between RBPs and circRNAs. Conclusion: In view of the poor studies about the sequence specificities of circRNA-binding proteins, we designed a classification framework called circRB based on the capsule network. The results show that the circRB method is an effective method, and it achieves higher prediction accuracy than other methods.",
