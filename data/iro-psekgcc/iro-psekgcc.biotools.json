This task is of great significance in DNA sequence analysis. Because of its importance, some computational approaches have been introduced. Among these predictors, the iRO-3wPseKNC predictor is the first discriminative method that is able to correctly identify the entire replication origins. For further improving its predictive performance, we proposed the Pseudo k-tuple GC Composition (PsekGCC) approach to capture the \u201cGC asymmetry bias\u201d of yeast species by considering both the GC skew and the sequence order effects of k-tuple GC Composition (k-GCC) in this study. Based on PseKGCC, we proposed a new predictor called iRO-PsekGCC to identify the DNA replication origins. Rigorous jackknife test on two yeast species benchmark datasets (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris) indicated that iRO-PsekGCC outperformed iRO-3wPseKNC. It can be anticipated that iRO-PsekGCC will be a useful tool for DNA replication origin identification. Availability and implementation: The web-server for the iRO-PsekGCC predictor was established, and it can be accessed at http://bliulab.net/iRO-PsekGCC/.",
