Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Summary: DNA methylation is one of the most commonly studied epigenetic modifications due to its role in both disease and development. The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is a cost-effective way to profile >450 000 CpGs across the human genome, making it a popular platform for profiling DNA methylation. Here we introduce missMethyl, an R package with a suite of tools for performing normalization, removal of unwanted variation in differential methylation analysis, differential variability testing and gene set analysis for the 450K array. Availability and implementation: missMethyl is an R package available from the Bioconductor project at www.bioconductor.org.
