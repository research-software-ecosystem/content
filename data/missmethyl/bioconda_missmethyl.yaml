description: Normalisation and testing for differential variability and differential
  methylation for data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. The normalisation
  procedure is subset-quantile within-array normalisation (SWAN), which allows Infinium
  I and II type probes on a single array to be normalised together. The test for differential
  variability is based on an empirical Bayes version of Levene's test. Differential
  methylation testing is performed using RUV, which can adjust for systematic errors
  of unknown origin in high-dimensional data by using negative control probes. Gene
  ontology analysis is performed by taking into account the number of probes per gene
  on the array.
