    "description": "Normalisation and testing for differential variability and differential methylation for data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 array. The normalisation procedure is subset-quantile within-array normalisation (SWAN). The test for differential variability is based on an empirical Bayes version of Levene's test. Gene ontology analysis is performed by taking into account the number of probes per gene on the array.",

Summary: DNA methylation is one of the most commonly studied epigenetic modifications due to its role in both disease and development. The Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip is a cost-effective way to profile >450 000 CpGs across the human genome, making it a popular platform for profiling DNA methylation. Here we introduce missMethyl, an R package with a suite of tools for performing normalization, removal of unwanted variation in differential methylation analysis, differential variability testing and gene set analysis for the 450K array. Availability and implementation: missMethyl is an R package available from the Bioconductor project at www.bioconductor.org. Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
