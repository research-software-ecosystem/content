It integrates thousands of manually curated, well described public microarray and RNAseq experiments and nicely visualizes gene expression across different biological contexts such as diseases, drugs, tissues, cancers, cell lines or genotypes. The high diversity of curated experiments allows the tool to project your genes or your data against a broad spectrum of reference profiles and datasets.",
