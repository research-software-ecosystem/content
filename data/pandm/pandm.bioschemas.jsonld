      "sc:description": "Pan-cancer analysis of differential DNA methylation patterns.\n\nPan-cancer differential methylation (DM) analysis investigates aberrant DNA methylation patterns in multiple distinct cancer types. PanDM is a statistical model for such comprehensive study. By jointly modeling DNA methylation profiles from various cancer types, PanDM is able to learn the pan-cancer commonalities and differences of DM patterns. PanDM works on the summary statistics from the individual DM analyses for each cancer type. Thus, it can be easily integrated with existing DM calling methods. Furthermore, the same framework can also be applied to pan-cancer analyses of other functional genomic profiles, such as transcriptomes.",
