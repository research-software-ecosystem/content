The intensity variation related to radiation damage is approximated by log-linear functions of resolution and cumulative X - ray dose. Based on an accurate prediction of the basic characteristics of data yet to be collected, BEST establishes objective relationships between the accessible data completeness, resolution and signal-to-noise statistics that can be achieved in an experiment and designs an optimal plan for data collection.","authors":["Bourenkov G.P.","Popov A.N."],"cit_count":78,"journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section D: Biological Crystallography","pmid":"20382994","title":"Optimization of data collection taking radiation damage into account","year":"2010-04-19"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:best","biotoolsID":"best","description":"Program for optimal planning of X-ray data collection from protein crystals","homepage":"http://www.embl-hamburg.de/BEST/","name":"BEST"}}
