      "sc:description": "Metabolic Modeling of Streptococcus mutans Reveals Complex Nutrient Requirements of an Oral Pathogen.\n\nStreptococcus mutans is a Gram-positive bacterium that thrives under acidic conditions and is a primary cause of tooth decay (dental caries). To better understand the metabolism of S. mutans on a systematic level, we manually constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of the S. mutans type strain UA159. The model, called iSMU, contains 675 reactions involving 429 metabolites and the products of 493 genes. We validated iSMU by comparing simulations with growth experiments in defined medium. The model simulations matched experimental results for 17 of 18 carbon source utilization assays and 47 of 49 nutrient depletion assays. We also simulated the effects of single gene deletions. The model's predictions agreed with 78.1% and 84.4% of the gene essentiality predictions from two experimental data sets.",
