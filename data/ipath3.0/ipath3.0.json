It is freely available and open to everyone. Currently it is based on four KEGG global maps, which summarize up to 158 traditional KEGG pathway maps, 192 KEGG modules and other metabolic elements into one connected and manually curated metabolic network. Users can fully customize these networks and interactively explore them through its redesigned, fast and lightweight interface, which highlights general metabolic trends in multi-omics data. It also offers navigation at various levels of details to help users further investigate those trends and ultimately uncover novel biological insights. Support for multiple experimental conditions and time-series datasets, tools for generation of customization data, programmatic access, and a free user accounts system were introduced in this version to further streamline its workflow.",
