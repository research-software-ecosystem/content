    "description": "A Supervised Method to Detect Motifs From Annotated Groups in Alignments.\n\nMotifs from Annotated Groups in Alignments.\n\nMAGA is a new simpler way to infer information from alignments. Based on a regular procedure usually done visually by experts, it looks for group-conserved residues in an alignment. Provided an alignment in FASTA format and a way to group the sequences in it, MAGA seeks to access an unexplored layer of information difficult to appreciate visually when many sequences are aligned, even for a trained bioinformatician.",

But sometimes, it is interesting to study residue conservation at positions unconstrained by evolutionary rules. We present a supervised method to access a layer of information difficult to appreciate visually when many protein sequences are aligned. This new tool (MAGA; http://cbdm-01.zdv.uni-mainz.de/~munoz/maga/) locates positions in multiple sequence alignments differentially conserved in manually defined groups of sequences.",
