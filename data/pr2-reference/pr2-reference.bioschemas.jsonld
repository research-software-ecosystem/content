It aims to provide a reference database of carefully annotated 18S rRNA sequences using nine unique taxonomic fields (from domain to species). At present, it contains over 240,000 sequences. Although it focuses on protists, it also contains sequences from metazoa, fungi and plants as well a limited set of 16S sequences from plastids and bacteria. Several metadata fields are available for many sequences, including geo-localisation, whether it originates from a culture or a natural sample, host type etcâ€¦ The annotation of PR2 is performed by experts from each taxonomic groups.",
