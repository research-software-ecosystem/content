description: "cd-hit contains a number of programs designed to quickly group sequences.\
  \ cd-hit groups proteins into clusters that meet a user-defined similarity threshold.\
  \ cd-hit-est is similar to cd-hit, but designed to group nucleotide sequences (without\
  \ introns). cd-hit-est-2d is similar to cd-hit-2d but designed to compare two nucleotide\
  \ datasets. A number of other related programs are also in this package. Please\
  \ see the cd-hit user manual, also part of this package, for further information.\n"
