description: cd-hit contains a number of programs designed to quickly group sequences.
  cd-hit groups proteins into clusters that meet a user-defined similarity threshold.
  cd-hit-est is similar to cd-hit, but designed to group nucleotide sequences (without
  introns). cd-hit-est-2d is similar to cd-hit-2d but designed to compare two nucleotide
  datasets. A number of other related programs are also in this package. Please see
  the cd-hit user manual, also part of this package, for further information.
