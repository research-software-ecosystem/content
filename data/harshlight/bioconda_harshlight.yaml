description: The package is used to detect extended, diffuse and compact blemishes
  on microarray chips. Harshlight automatically marks the areas in a collection of
  chips (affybatch objects) and a corrected AffyBatch object is returned, in which
  the defected areas are substituted with NAs or the median of the values of the same
  probe in the other chips in the collection. The new version handle the substitute
  value as whole matrix to solve the memory problem.
