biotools_id: cancermutationanalysis
description: This package implements gene and gene-set level analysis methods for
  somatic mutation studies of cancer.  The gene-level methods distinguish between
  driver genes (which play an active role in tumorigenesis) and passenger genes (which
  are mutated in tumor samples, but have no role in tumorigenesis) and incorporate
  a two-stage study design.  The gene-set methods implement a patient-oriented approach,
  which calculates gene-set scores for each sample, then combines them across samples;
  a gene-oriented approach which uses the Wilcoxon test is also provided for comparison.
