  "sc:description": "This package implements gene and gene-set level analysis methods for somatic mutation studies of cancer. The gene-level methods distinguish between driver and passenger genes, and incorporate a two-stage study design. The gene-set methods implement a patient-oriented approach, which calculates gene-set scores for each sample, then combines them across samples; a gene-oriented approach which uses the Wilcoxon test is also provided for comparison.",
