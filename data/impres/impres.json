    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | development, application, feasibility and preliminary evaluation of the implementation science research development (ImpRes) tool and guide | BACKGROUND:Designing implementation research can be a complex and daunting task, especially for applied health researchers who have not received specialist training in implementation science. We developed the Implementation Science Research Development (ImpRes) tool and supplementary guide to address this challenge and provide researchers with a systematic approach to designing implementation research. METHODS:A multi-method and multi-stage approach was employed. An international, multidisciplinary expert panel engaged in an iterative brainstorming and consensus-building process to generate core domains of the ImpRes tool, representing core implementation science principles and concepts that researchers should consider when designing implementation research",
