The probabilities of physicochemical properties such as mass, accessible surface and radius of gyration are calculated. The purpose of this service is to provide rapid access to reliable 3D models of glycoproteins, which can subsequently be refined by using more elaborate simulations and validated by comparing the generated models with experimental data. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.",
