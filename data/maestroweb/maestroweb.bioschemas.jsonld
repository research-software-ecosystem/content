  "sc:description": "MAESTRO-web is web interface to MAESTRO, a Multi AgEnt STability pRedictiOn tool for calculating changes in unfolding free energy upon point mutation. MAESTRO is structure based, which means that the 3-d structure of the wild type is required. It is able to predict single- and multi-point in monomeric and multimeric proteins. In addition, MAESTROweb provides mutation sensitivity profiles, a scanner for the most (de)stabilizing mutations and potential S-S bonds sites.",
