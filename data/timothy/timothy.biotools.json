    "description": "Timothy is a novel large scale parallel computational model allowing 3-D simulations of cell colonies growing and interacting with variable environment in previously unavailable tissue scale.\nThe cells are modeled as individuals located in the lattice-free 3-D space. The model incorporates cellular environment modelled in a continuous manner, mathematical description based on partial differential equations is formulated for selected important components of the environment. Discrete and continuous formulations are efficiently coupled in one model and allow considerations on different scales: sub-cellular, cellular and tissue scale.\nHigh parallel scalability achieved allows simulation of up to 109 individual cells. This large scale computational approach allows for simulations to be carried out over realistic spatial scales up to 1cm in size i.e. the tissue scale.",

                "abstract": "© 2014 IEEE.Biological processes are inherently complex and involve many unknown relationships and mechanisms at different scales. Despite many efforts, researchers still can't explain all of the observed phenomena and, if necessary, make any desirable changes in the dynamics. Recently, it has become apparent that a research opportunity lies in complementing the traditional, heuristic experimental approach with mathematical modeling and computer simulations. Achieving a simulation scale that corresponds, for instance, to clinically detectable tumor sizes is still a huge challenge, however, this scale is necessary to understand and control complex biological processes. This article presents a novel, high-performance computational approach allowing simulations of 3D cell colony dynamics at a previously unavailable tissue scale. Due to its high parallel scalability, the method achieves simulation of cell colonies composed of 109 cells, which allows for describing tumor growth in its early clinical stage.",
