      "sc:description": "Efficient and Extensible Software to Construct an Anatomical Basis for a Physiologically Realistic Neural Network Model.\n\nPycabnn (Python tool for Constructing an Anatomical Basis of a Neural Network; pronounce it as \"pie cabin\") is a Python 3 package to aid building a physiologically realistic neural network model. Pycabnn is for setting up a structural basis of a model, such as placing neurons in space and determine their connectivity, based on anatomical constraints. It is primarily developed for a model of the granular layer in the cerebellar cortex [1]. However, we tried to make it as adaptable as possible to other circuit models.",
