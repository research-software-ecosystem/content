      "sc:description": "Taxonomy-aware, sequence similarity ranking reliably predicts phage-host relationships.\n\nA tool to predict prokaryotic hosts for phage (meta)genomic sequences. The tool uses information on sequence similarity between phage and bacteria genomes as well as sequence relatedness among bacteria.\n\n\nPhirbo estimates the phage-host relationship by comparing the content and order between phage and host ranked lists using Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) measure. Briefly, RBO fosters comparison of ranked lists of different lengths with heavier weights for matching the higher-ranking items. RBO ranges between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the lists are disjoint (have no items in common) and 1 means that the lists are identical in content and order.",
