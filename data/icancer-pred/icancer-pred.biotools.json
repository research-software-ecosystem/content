                "abstract": "© 2022 The AuthorsDNA methylation is an important epigenetics, which occurs in the early stages of tumor formation. And it also is of great significance to find the relationship between DNA methylation and cancer. This paper proposes a novel model, iCancer-Pred, to identify cancer and classify its types further. The datasets of DNA methylation information of 7 cancer types have been collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The coefficient of variation firstly is used to reduce the number of features, and then the elastic network is applied to select important features. Finally, a fully connected neural network is constructed with these selected features. In predicting seven types of cancers, iCancer-Pred has achieved an overall accuracy of over 97% accuracy with 5-fold cross-validation. For the convenience of the application, a user-friendly web server: http://bioinfo.jcu.edu.cn/cancer or http://121.36.221.79/cancer/ is available. And the source codes are freely available for download at https://github.com/Huerhu/iCancer-Pred.",
