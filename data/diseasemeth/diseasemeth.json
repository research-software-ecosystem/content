The integration and mining of DNA methylation data by methylation-specific PCR and genome-wide profiling technology could greatly assist the discovery of novel candidate disease biomarkers. However, this is difficult without a comprehensive DNA methylation repository of human diseases. Therefore, we have developed DiseaseMeth, a human disease methylation database (http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/diseasemeth). Its focus is the efficient storage and statistical analysis of DNA methylation data sets from various diseases. Experimental information from over 14 000 entries and 175 high-throughput data sets from a wide number of sources have been collected and incorporated into DiseaseMeth. The latest release incorporates the gene-centric methylation data of 72 human diseases from a variety of technologies and platforms. To facilitate data extraction, DiseaseMeth supports multiple search options such as gene ID and disease name. DiseaseMeth provides integrated gene methylation data based on cross-data set analysis for disease and normal samples. These can be used for in-depth identification of differentially methylated genes and the investigation of gene-disease relationship. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.
