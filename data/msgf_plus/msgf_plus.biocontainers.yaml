description: Ms-gf+ is a new ms/ms database search tool that is sensitive (it identifies
  more peptides than other database search tools and as many peptides as spectral
  library search tools) and universal (works well for diverse types of spectra, different
  configurations of ms instruments and different experimental protocols).
