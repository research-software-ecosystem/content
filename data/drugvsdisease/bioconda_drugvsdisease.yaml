biotools_id: drugvsdisease
description: This package generates ranked lists of differential gene expression for
  either disease or drug profiles. Input data can be downloaded from Array Express
  or GEO, or from local CEL files. Ranked lists of differential expression and associated
  p-values are calculated using Limma. Enrichment scores (Subramanian et al. PNAS
  2005) are calculated to a reference set of default drug or disease profiles, or
  a set of custom data supplied by the user. Network visualisation of significant
  scores are output in Cytoscape format.
