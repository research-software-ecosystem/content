The characters representing the sequence are stacked on top of each other for each position in the aligned sequences. The height of each letter is made proportional to Its frequency, and the letters are sorted so the most common one is on top. The height of the entire stack is then adjusted to signify the information content of the sequences at that position. From these 'sequence logos', one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content (measured In bits) at every position in a site or sequence. The logo displays both significant residues and subtle sequence patterns. © 1990 Oxford University Press.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: We extend the standard ‘Sequence Logo’method of Schneider and Stevens (Nucleic Acids Res., 18, 6097–6100, 1990) to incorporate prior frequencies on the bases, allow ft, r gaps in the alignments, and indicate the mutual information of base-paired regions in RNA. Results: Given an alignment of RNA sequences with the base pairings indicated, the program will calculate the information at each position. including the mutual information of the base pairs. and display the results in a ‘Structure Logo’. Alignments without base pairing can also be displayed in a ‘Sequence Logo’. but still allowing gaps and incorporating prior frequencies if desired. Availability: The code is available from, and an Internet server can be used to run the program at, http://www.cbs.dtu.dklgorodkin/appl/slogo.html.
