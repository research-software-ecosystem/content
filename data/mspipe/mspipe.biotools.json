                "abstract": "Background: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that is known to regulate gene expression. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is a powerful method for studying cytosine methylation in a whole genome. However, it is difficult to obtain methylation profiles using the WGBS raw reads and is necessary to be proficient in all types of bioinformatic tools for the study of DNA methylation. In addition, recent end-to-end pipelines for DNA methylation analyses are not sufficient for addressing those difficulties. Results: Here we present msPIPE, a pipeline for DNA methylation analyses with WGBS data seamlessly connecting all the required tasks ranging from data pre-processing to multiple downstream DNA methylation analyses. The msPIPE can generate various methylation profiles to analyze methylation patterns in the given sample, including statistical summaries and methylation levels. Also, the methylation levels in the functional regions of a genome are computed with proper annotation. The results of methylation profiles, hypomethylation, and differential methylation analysis are plotted in publication-quality figures. The msPIPE can be easily and conveniently used with a Docker image, which includes all dependent packages and software related to DNA methylation analyses. Conclusion: msPIPE is a new end-to-end pipeline designed for methylation calling, profiling, and various types of downstream DNA methylation analyses, leading to the creation of publication-quality figures. msPIPE allows researchers to process and analyze the WGBS data in an easy and convenient way. It is available at https://github.com/jkimlab/msPIPE and https://hub.docker.com/r/jkimlab/mspipe.",
