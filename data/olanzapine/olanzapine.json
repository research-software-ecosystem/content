    "description": "a review of recent olanzapine research.\n\nObjective: Based on a substantial literature, olanzapine appears to be one of the most efficacious antipsychotics marketed in the United States, with only clozapine clearly more advantageous. However, olanzapine is marred by an equally substantial literature demonstrating a metabolic burden of olanzapine, particularly for weight gain. With the publication of successful strategies to limit olanzapine induced weight gain, a reassessment of the clinical utility of olanzapine appears warranted. The purpose of this paper is to review recent evidence for olanzapine, highlighting use in both schizophrenia and other conditions, safety and supporting the use of olanzapine above 20 mg day, focusing on studies published since our previous reviews in 2008 and 2009.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'New discoveries old drug'",
