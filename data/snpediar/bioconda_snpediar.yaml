description: SNPediaR provides some tools for downloading and parsing data from the
  SNPedia web site <http://www.snpedia.com>. The implemented functions allow users
  to import the wiki text available in SNPedia pages and to extract the most relevant
  information out of them. If some information in the downloaded pages is not automatically
  processed by the library functions, users can easily implement their own parsers
  to access it in an efficient way.
