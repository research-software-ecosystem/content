Screening the random peptide libraries constructed with phage display or any other surface display technologies provides an efficient and convenient approach to acquire mimotopes. However, target-unrelated peptides creep into mimotopes from time to time through binding to contaminants or other components of the screening system. In this study, we present SAROTUP, a free web tool for scanning, reporting and excluding possible target-unrelated peptides from real mimotopes. Preliminary tests show that SAROTUP is efficient and capable of improving the accuracy of mimotope-based epitope mapping. It is also helpful for the development of mimotope-based diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. © 2010 Jian Huang et al.","authors":["Huang J.","Ru B.","Li S.","Lin H.","Guo F.-B."],"cit_count":55,"doi":"10.1155/2010/101932","journal":"Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology","title":"SAROTUP: Scanner and reporter of target-unrelated peptides","type":"Primary","year":"2010-05-06"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sarotup","biotoolsID":"sarotup","description":"Scan, report and exclude possible target-unrelated peptides from biopanning results.","homepage":"http://i.uestc.edu.cn/sarotup/index.html","name":"SAROTUP","version":["2.0"]}}
