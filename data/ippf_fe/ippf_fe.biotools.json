                "abstract": "The prediction of peptide and protein function is important for research and industrial applications, and many machine learning methods have been developed for this purpose. The existing models have encountered many challenges, including the lack of effective and comprehensive features and the limited applicability of each model. Here, we introduce an Integrated Peptide and Protein function prediction Framework based on Fused features and Ensemble models (IPPF-FE), which can accurately capture the relationship between features and labels. The results indicated that IPPF-FE outperformed existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on more than 8 different categories of peptide and protein tasks. In addition, t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding demonstrated the advantages of IPPF-FE. We anticipate that our method will become a versatile tool for peptide and protein prediction tasks and shed light on the future development of related models. The model is open source and available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/Luo-SynBioLab/ IPPF-FE.",
