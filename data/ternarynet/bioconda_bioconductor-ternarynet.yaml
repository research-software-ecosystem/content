about:
  description: 'Gene-regulatory network (GRN) modeling seeks to infer dependencies
    between genes and thereby provide insight into the regulatory relationships that
    exist within a cell. This package provides a computational Bayesian approach to
    GRN estimation from perturbation experiments using a ternary network model, in
    which gene expression is discretized into one of 3 states: up, unchanged, or down).
    The ternarynet package includes a parallel implementation of the replica exchange
    Monte Carlo algorithm for fitting network models, using MPI.'
