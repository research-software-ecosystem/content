description: Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with
  biological replication. Implements a range of statistical methodology based on the
  negative binomial distributions, including empirical Bayes estimation, exact tests,
  generalized linear models and quasi-likelihood tests. As well as RNA-seq, it be
  applied to differential signal analysis of other types of genomic data that produce
  counts, including ChIP-seq, Bisulfite-seq, SAGE and CAGE.
