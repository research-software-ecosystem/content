        "description": "a structure-based method to predict protein solubility and aggregation.\n\nSOLart is a fast and accurate method for predicting the protein solubility of a target protein whose experimental or modeled structure is available. It yields a scaled solubility score with values close to zero indicating aggregate-prone proteins, while values close to 130 designate soluble proteins.\n\nThe input information required by SOLart is the protein structure that is uploaded either manually by the user or automatically from the Protein Data Bank. Using the solubility-dependent potentials that we recently introduced and a few sequence-based features, SOLart computes the solubility score in a few minutes.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/aclame (ULB.AC.BE)",
