                "abstract": "\u00a9 Copyright \u00a9 2021 Cui, Cui, Gao, Jiang, Zang and Wang.Single-cell Assay Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) has been widely used in profiling genome-wide chromatin accessibility in thousands of individual cells. However, compared with single-cell RNA-seq, the peaks of scATAC-seq are much sparser due to the lower copy numbers (diploid in humans) and the inherent missing signals, which makes it more challenging to classify cell type based on specific expressed gene or other canonical markers. Here, we present svmATAC, a support vector machine (SVM)-based method for accurately identifying cell types in scATAC-seq datasets by enhancing peak signal strength and imputing signals through patterns of co-accessibility. We applied svmATAC to several scATAC-seq data from human immune cells, human hematopoietic system cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The benchmark results showed that svmATAC is free of literature-based markers and robust across datasets in different libraries and platforms.
