      "sc:description": "A web-based clinical trials tool for monitoring and predicting accrual for early-phase cancer studies | BACKGROUND:Monitoring subject recruitment is key to the success of a clinical trial. Accordingly, researchers have developed accrual-monitoring tools to support the design and conduct of trials. At an institutional level, delays in identifying studies with high risk of accrual failure can lead to inefficient and costly trials with little chances of meeting study objectives. Comprehensive accrual monitoring is necessary to the success of the research enterprise. METHODS:This article describes the design and implementation of the University of Kansas Cancer Center Accrual Prediction Program, a web-based platform was developed to support comprehensive accrual monitoring and prediction for all active clinical trials",
