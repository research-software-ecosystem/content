description: Genome segmentation with hidden Markov models has become a useful tool
  to annotate genomic elements, such as promoters and enhancers. STAN (genomic STate
  ANnotation) implements (bidirectional) hidden Markov models (HMMs) using a variety
  of different probability distributions, which can model a wide range of current
  genomic data (e.g. continuous, discrete, binary). STAN de novo learns and annotates
  the genome into a given number of 'genomic states'. The 'genomic states' may for
  instance reflect distinct genome-associated protein complexes (e.g. 'transcription
  states') or describe recurring patterns of chromatin features (referred to as 'chromatin
  states'). Unlike other tools, STAN also allows for the integration of strand-specific
  (e.g. RNA) and non-strand-specific data (e.g. ChIP).
