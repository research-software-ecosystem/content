Our studies of the H4 ARS and ARS3O7 have established the requirement for a DNA unwinding element (DUE), a broad easily-unwound sequence 3\u2032 to the essential consensus that likely facilitates opening of the origin. in this report, we examine the intrinsic ease of unwinding a variety of ARS elements using (1) a single-strand-specific nuclease to probe for DNA unwinding in a negatively-supercoiled piasmid, and (2) a computer program that calculates DNA helical stability from the nucleotide sequence. ARS elements that are associated with replication origins on chromosome III are nuclease hypersensitive, and the helical stability minima correctly predict the location and hierarchy of the hypersensitive sites. All well-studied ARS elements in which the essential consensus sequence has been identified by mutational analysis contain a 100-bp region of low helical stability immediately 3\u2032 to the consensus, as do ARS elements created by mutation within the prokaryotic M13 vector. The level of helical stability is, in all cases, below that of ARS3O7 derivatives inactivated by mutations in the DUE. Our findings indicate that the ease of DNA unwinding at the broad region directly 3\u2032 to the ARS consensus is a conserved property of yeast replication origins. \u00a9 1993 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 91, "authors": [{"name": "Natale D.A."}, {"name": "Umek R.M."}, {"name": "Kowalski D."}], "date": "1993-02-11T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "12824427", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "WEB-THERMODYN: Sequence analysis software for profiling DNA helical stability", "abstract": "WEB-THERMODYN analyzes DNA sequences and computes the DNA helical stability, i.e. the free energy required to unwind and separate the strands of the double helix.
