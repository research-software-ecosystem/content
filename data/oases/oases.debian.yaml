  description: de novo transcriptome assembler for very short reads
  long_description: " Oases is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed to produce\n\
    \ transcripts from short read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina,\n SOLiD,
    or 454 in the absence of any genomic assembly.  Oases uploads a\n preliminary
    assembly produced by Velvet, and clusters the contigs into\n small groups, called
    loci. It then exploits the paired-end read and long\n read information, when available,
    to construct transcript isoforms."
