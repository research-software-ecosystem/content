description: Oases is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed to produce transcripts
  from short read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina, SOLiD, or 454 in the
  absence of any genomic assembly. Oases uploads a preliminary assembly produced by
  Velvet, and clusters the contigs into small groups, called loci. It then exploits
  the paired-end read and long read information, when available, to construct transcript
  isoforms.
