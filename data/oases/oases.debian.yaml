summary: de novo transcriptome assembler for very short reads
description: >
   Oases is a de novo transcriptome assembler designed to produce
   transcripts from short read sequencing technologies, such as Illumina,
   SOLiD, or 454 in the absence of any genomic assembly.  Oases uploads a
   preliminary assembly produced by Velvet, and clusters the contigs into
   small groups, called loci. It then exploits the paired-end read and long
   read information, when available, to construct transcript isoforms.
