    "description": "an open-source platform for single-molecule FRET.\n\n(change this slider to rotate the smfBox).\n\nSingle molecule F\u00f6rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) can be used to obtain a unique level of information for dynamic processes involving biological molecules, as well as revealing structural information. The Craggs Lab of The University of Sheffield has developed an open-source microscopy platform for making smFRET measurements at a fraction of the price of typical commercial systems. The smfBox system can be built for around 40,000 GBP using commercially available parts and fabrication of a simple microscope body. It requires a relatively small footprint on an optics bench or optical breadboard. When complete can be used as a class 1 laser product; all beams are enclosed, and a mechanical shutter connected to the lid prevents laser light from entering the box when the lid is open",
