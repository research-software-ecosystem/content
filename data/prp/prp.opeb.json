Among these, the transcription factors, DNA and histone modifications, and post-transcriptional control by small RNAs like miRNAs serve as major regulators. An understanding of the integrative and spatio-temporal impact of these regulatory factors can provide better insights into the state of a 'cell system'. Yet, there are limited resources available to this effect. Therefore, we hereby report an integrative information portal (Plant Regulomics Portal; PRP) for plants for the first time.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Plant Regulomics Portal'","homepage":"https://scbb.ihbt.res.in/PRP","name":"PRP"}}
