      "sc:description": "PRP is a comprehensive integrated regulatory information and analysis portal for plant genomes.\n\nGene regulation is a highly complex and networked phenomenon where multiple tiers of control determine the cell state in a spatio-temporal manner. Among these, the transcription factors, DNA and histone modifications, and post-transcriptional control by small RNAs like miRNAs serve as major regulators. An understanding of the integrative and spatio-temporal impact of these regulatory factors can provide better insights into the state of a 'cell system'. Yet, there are limited resources available to this effect. Therefore, we hereby report an integrative information portal (Plant Regulomics Portal; PRP) for plants for the first time.",
