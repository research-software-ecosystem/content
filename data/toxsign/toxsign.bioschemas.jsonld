      "sc:description": "The TOXicogenomic sIgNature (TOXsIgN) is a cross-species resource that supports online submission, storage, and retrieval of TOXicogenomic sIgNatures. TOXsIgN aims at complementing existing resources by acting as a distribution hub for the community. One of its unique features is its ability to archive heterogeneous data. TOXsIgN thus allows users to upload lists of genes positively (overexpressed for transcriptomic assays) affected and negatively (underexpressed) affected from distinct –omics experiments (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, or epigenomics). It also provides users with a working environment containing a powerful search engine as well as bioinformatics/biostatistics modules that enable cross-species and cross-technology signature comparisons or enrichment analyses. TOXsIgN is thus intended to serve as a warehouse for toxicogenomics and predictive toxicology tools simultaneously based on and able to analyze the overall set of signatures deposited by the community.",
