      "sc:description": "a curated database for intrapatient tumor heterogeneity.\n\nCancerTracer is a manually curated and integrated database aims to help researchers to decipher tumor heterogeneity at individual patient level. It contains two types of tumor heterogeneity data: 1) Intra-tumor or Intra-metastatic heterogeneity: the presence of multiple subclones within a primary tumor or a single metastatic lesion; 2) Inter-metastatic heterogeneity: the presence of different subclones in different metastatic lesions of the same patient. Somatic mutations and copy number alterations are available in CancerTracer, since both of them are principal factors drive heterogeneity in cancer. The structured heterogeneity data enables researchers to identify trunk mutations in different cancer types and investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying intratumor heterogeneity",
