                "abstract": "The compartmental organization of mammalian genomes and its changes play important roles in distinct biological processes. Here, we introduce dcHiC, which utilizes a multivariate distance measure to identify significant changes in compartmentalization among multiple contact maps. Evaluating dcHiC on four collections of bulk and single-cell contact maps from in vitro mouse neural differentiation (n = 3), mouse hematopoiesis (n = 10), human LCLs (n = 20) and post-natal mouse brain development (n = 3 stages), we show its effectiveness and sensitivity in detecting biologically relevant changes, including those orthogonally validated. dcHiC reported regions with dynamically regulated genes associated with cell identity, along with correlated changes in chromatin states, subcompartments, replication timing and lamin association. With its efficient implementation, dcHiC enables high-resolution compartment analysis as well as standalone browser visualization, differential interaction identification and time-series clustering. dcHiC is an essential addition to the Hi-C analysis toolbox for the ever-growing number of bulk and single-cell contact maps.
