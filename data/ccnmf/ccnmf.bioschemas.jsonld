      "sc:description": "Coupled-Clone Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CCNMF) is a method for joint inference of clonal structure using paired Single-cell DNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data. The framework is based on optimizing an objective function that maximizes clone structure coherence between single-cell gene expression and copy number profiles, in which the two profiles are copuled by the dosage effect. The coupling dosage effect can be estimated a prior either by a linear regression model using publicly aviable paired RNA and DNA bulk sequencing data (TCGA), or by using an uninformative prior. The workflow in CCNMF is illustrated in the figure below.",
