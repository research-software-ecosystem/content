  description: Mixture of Isoforms model for RNA-Seq isoform quantitation (Python
    3)
  long_description: " MISO (Mixture of Isoforms) is a probabilistic framework that\
    \ quantitates\n the expression level of alternatively spliced genes from RNA-Seq\n\
    \ data, and identifies differentially regulated isoforms or exons across\n samples.\
    \ By modeling the generative process by which reads are produced\n from isoforms\
    \ in RNA-Seq, the MISO model uses Bayesian inference to\n compute the probability\
    \ that a read originated from a particular isoform.\n .\n MISO uses the inferred\
    \ assignment of reads to isoforms to quantitate the\n abundances of the underlying\
    \ set of alternative mRNA isoforms. Confidence\n intervals over estimates can\
    \ be obtained, which quantify the reliability\n of the estimates.\n .\n This is\
    \ the Python 3 module."
