For PCR, after selection of the genome and introduction of primers, fragment size, DNA sequence and corresponding open reading frame (ORF) identity of the resulting PCR product is computed. Plasmids of sequenced species may be included in the analysis. Theoretical AFLP-PCR analyzes similar parameters, and includes a suggestion tool providing a list of commercial restriction enzyme pairs yielding up to 50 amplicons in the selected genome. Endonuclease restriction analysis of complete genomes and plasmids calculates the number of restriction sites for endonucleases in a given genome. If the number of fragments is 50 or fewer, pulsed field gel electrophoresis image and restriction maps are illustrated. Other tools that have been included in this site are ORF search by name and DNA to protein translation as well as restriction digestion of user-defined DNA sequences. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Bikandi J.","Millan R.S.","Rementeria A.","Garaizar J."],"cit_count":189,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"14752001","title":"In silico analysis of complete bacterial genomes: PCR, AFLP-PCR and endonuclease restriction","year":"2004-03-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:insilicosimmolbioexpt","biotoolsID":"insilicosimmolbioexpt","description":"Provides tools for theoretical PCR amplification, AFLP-PCR and PFGE with all up-to-date public complete bacterial genomes (300+ genomes available).","homepage":"http://insilico.ehu.es/","name":"In silico simulation of molbio experiments"}}
