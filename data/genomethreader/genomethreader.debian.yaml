  description: software tool to compute gene structure predictions
  long_description: " GenomeThreader is a software tool to compute gene structure\
    \ predictions.\n The gene structure predictions are calculated using a similarity-based\n\
    \ approach where additional cDNA/EST and/or protein sequences are used to\n predict\
    \ gene structures via spliced alignments. GenomeThreader was motivated\n by disabling\
    \ limitations in GeneSeqer, a popular gene prediction program\n which is widely\
    \ used for plant genome annotation.\n"
