biotools_id: qsea
description: qsea (quantitative sequencing enrichment analysis) was developed as the
  successor of the MEDIPS package for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation
  (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). However, qsea provides several
  functionalities for the analysis of other kinds of quantitative sequencing data
  (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) including calculation of differential
  enrichment between groups of samples.
