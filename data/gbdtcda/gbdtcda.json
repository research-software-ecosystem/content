    "description": "Predicting circRNA-disease Associations Based on Gradient Boosting Decision Tree with Multiple Biological Data Fusion.\n\nCircular RNA (circRNA) is a closed-loop structural non-coding RNA molecule which plays a significant role during the gene regulation processes. There are many previous studies shown that circRNAs can be regarded as the sponges of miRNAs. Thus, circRNA is also a key point for disease diagnosing, treating and inferring. However, traditional experimental approaches to verify the associations between the circRNA and disease are time-consuming and money-consuming. There are few computational models to predict potential circRNA-disease associations, which become our motivation to propose a new computational model.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CircR2Disease'",
