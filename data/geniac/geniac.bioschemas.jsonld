      "sc:description": "Geniac is an automatic configuration generator and Installer for nextflow pipelines. With the advent of high-throughput biotechnological platforms and their ever-growing capacity, life science has turned into a digitized, computational and data-intensive discipline. As a consequence, standard analysis with a bioinformatics pipeline in the context of routine production has become a challenge such that the data can be processed in real-time and delivered to the end-users as fast as possible. The usage of workflow management systems along with packaging systems and containerization technologies offer an opportunity to tackle this challenge. While very powerful, they can be used and combined in multiple ways thus increasing their usage complexity",
