biotools_id: lpsymphony
description: This package was derived from Rsymphony_0.1-17 from CRAN. These packages
  provide an R interface to SYMPHONY, an open-source linear programming solver written
  in C++. The main difference between this package and Rsymphony is that it includes
  the solver source code (SYMPHONY version 5.6), while Rsymphony expects to find header
  and library files on the users' system. Thus the intention of lpsymphony is to provide
  an easy to install interface to SYMPHONY. For Windows, precompiled DLLs are included
  in this package.
