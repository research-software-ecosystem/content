Pathway Commons provides a web-based interface that enables biologists to browse and search a comprehensive collection of pathways from multiple sources represented in a common language, a download site that provides integrated bulk sets of pathway information in standard or convenient formats and a web service that software developers can use to conveniently query and access all data. Database providers can share their pathway data via a common repository. Pathways include biochemical reactions, complex assembly, transport and catalysis events and physical interactions involving proteins, DNA, RNA, small molecules and complexes. Pathway Commons aims to collect and integrate all public pathway data available in standard formats. Pathway Commons currently contains data from nine databases with over 1400 pathways and 687 000 interactions and will be continually expanded and updated. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Cerami E.G.","Gross B.E.","Demir E.","Rodchenkov I.","Babur O.","Anwar N.","Schultz N.","Bader G.D.","Sander C."],"cit_count":515,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21071392","title":"Pathway Commons, a web resource for biological pathway data","type":"Primary","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:PathwayCommons_SPARQL_endpoint","biotoolsID":"PathwayCommons_SPARQL_endpoint","description":"Pathway Commons aims to collect and disseminate biological pathway and interaction data. Data is collected from partner databases and is represented in the BioPAX standard.
