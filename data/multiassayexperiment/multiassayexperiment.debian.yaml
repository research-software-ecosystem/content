description: "MultiAssayExperiment harmonizes data management of multiple assays performed\
  \ on an overlapping set of specimens. It provides a familiar Bioconductor user experience\
  \ by extending concepts from SummarizedExperiment, supporting an open-ended mix\
  \ of standard data classes for individual assays, and allowing subsetting by genomic\
  \ ranges or rownames.\n"
