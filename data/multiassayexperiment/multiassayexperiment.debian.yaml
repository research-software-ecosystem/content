summary: Software for integrating multi-omics experiments in BioConductor
description: >
   MultiAssayExperiment harmonizes data management of
   multiple assays performed on an overlapping set of specimens. It provides a
   familiar Bioconductor user experience by extending concepts from
   SummarizedExperiment, supporting an open-ended mix of standard data classes
   for individual assays, and allowing subsetting by genomic ranges or rownames.
