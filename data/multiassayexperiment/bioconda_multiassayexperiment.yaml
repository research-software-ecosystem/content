description: MultiAssayExperiment harmonizes data management of multiple experimental
  assays performed on an overlapping set of specimens. It provides a familiar Bioconductor
  user experience by extending concepts from SummarizedExperiment, supporting an open-ended
  mix of standard data classes for individual assays, and allowing subsetting by genomic
  ranges or rownames. Facilities are provided for reshaping data into wide and long
  formats for adaptability to graphing and downstream analysis.
