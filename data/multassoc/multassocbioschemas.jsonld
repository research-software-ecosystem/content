  "sc:description": "MultAssoc is a MATLAB software package for test of association of a disease with a group of SNPs after accounting for their interaction with another group of SNPs or environmental exposures. In addition to implementing two standard logistic regression based tests, the package implements a novel method, called TukAssoc, that uses the Tukey’s 1 d.f. model for interaction between two groups of covariates.",
