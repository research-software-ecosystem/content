description: Tests whether a set of counts fit a given expected ratio. For example,
  a genetic cross might be expected to produce four types in the relative frequencies
  of 9:3:3:1. To see whether a set of observed counts fits this expectation, one can
  examine all possible outcomes with xmulti() or a random sample of them with xmonte()
  and find the probability of an observation deviating from the expectation by at
  least as much as the observed. As a measure of deviation from the expected, one
  can use the log-likelihood ratio, the multinomial probability, or the classic chi-square
  statistic. A histogram of the test statistic can also be plotted and compared with
  the asymptotic curve.
