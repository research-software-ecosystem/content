Accurately measuring epigenetic marks such as 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) at the single-nucleotide level, requires combining data from DNA processing methods including traditional (BS), oxidative (oxBS) or Tet-Assisted (TAB) bisulfite conversion. We introduce the R package MLML2R, which provides maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) of 5-mC and 5-hmC proportions. While all other available R packages provide 5-mC and 5-hmC MLEs only for the oxBS+BS combination, MLML2R also provides MLE for TAB combinations. For combinations of any two of the methods, we derived the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm (PAVA) exact constrained MLE in analytical form. For the three methods combination, we implemented both the iterative method by Qu et al. [Qu, J., M. Zhou, Q. Song, E. E. Hong and A. D. Smith (2013): \"Mlml: Consistent simultaneous estimates of dna methylation and hydroxymethylation,\" Bioinformatics, 29, 2645-2646.], and also a novel non iterative approximation using Lagrange multipliers. The newly proposed non iterative solutions greatly decrease computational time, common bottlenecks when processing high-throughput data. The MLML2R package is flexible as it takes as input both, preprocessed intensities from Infinium Methylation arrays and counts from Next Generation Sequencing technologies.
