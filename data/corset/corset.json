Next generation sequencing has made it possible to perform differential gene expression studies in non-model organisms. For these studies, the need for a reference genome is circumvented by performing de novo assembly on the RNA-seq data. However, transcriptome assembly produces a multitude of contigs, which must be clustered into genes prior to differential gene expression detection. Here we present Corset, a method that hierarchically clusters contigs using shared reads and expression, then summarizes read counts to clusters, ready for statistical testing. Using a range of metrics, we demonstrate that Corset out-performs alternative methods.", "citationCount": 77, "authors": [{"name": "Davidson N.M."}, {"name": "Oshlack A."}], "date": "2014-07-26T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "unimelb.edu.au", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Australia", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "nadia.davidson@mcri.edu.au"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:corset", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/Oshlack/Corset/wiki", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2945"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Command-line software program to go from a de novo transcriptome assembly to gene-level counts.
