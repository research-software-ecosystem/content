    "description": "Command-line software program to go from a de novo transcriptome assembly to gene-level counts. This software takes a set of reads that have been multi-mapped to the transcriptome and hierarchically clusters the transcripts based on the proportion of shared reads and expression patterns. It will report the clusters and gene-level counts for each sample, which are easily tested for differential expression with count based tools such as edgeR and DESeq.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2014 Davidson and Oshlack; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.Next generation sequencing has made it possible to perform differential gene expression studies in non-model organisms. For these studies, the need for a reference genome is circumvented by performing de novo assembly on the RNA-seq data. However, transcriptome assembly produces a multitude of contigs, which must be clustered into genes prior to differential gene expression detection. Here we present Corset, a method that hierarchically clusters contigs using shared reads and expression, then summarizes read counts to clusters, ready for statistical testing. Using a range of metrics, we demonstrate that Corset out-performs alternative methods.",
