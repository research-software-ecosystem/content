This software takes a set of reads that have been multi-mapped to the transcriptome and hierarchically clusters the transcripts based on the proportion of shared reads and expression patterns. It will report the clusters and gene-level counts for each sample, which are easily tested for differential expression with count based tools such as edgeR and DESeq.",
