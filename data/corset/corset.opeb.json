Next generation sequencing has made it possible to perform differential gene expression studies in non-model organisms. For these studies, the need for a reference genome is circumvented by performing de novo assembly on the RNA-seq data. However, transcriptome assembly produces a multitude of contigs, which must be clustered into genes prior to differential gene expression detection. Here we present Corset, a method that hierarchically clusters contigs using shared reads and expression, then summarizes read counts to clusters, ready for statistical testing. Using a range of metrics, we demonstrate that Corset out-performs alternative methods.","authors":["Davidson N.M.","Oshlack A."],"cit_count":77,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-014-0410-6","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"Corset: Enabling differential gene expression analysis for de novo assembled transcriptomes","type":"Primary","year":"2014-07-26"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:corset","biotoolsID":"corset","description":"Command-line software program to go from a de novo transcriptome assembly to gene-level counts. This software takes a set of reads that have been multi-mapped to the transcriptome and hierarchically clusters the transcripts based on the proportion of shared reads and expression patterns. It will report the clusters and gene-level counts for each sample, which are easily tested for differential expression with count based tools such as edgeR and DESeq.","homepage":"https://github.com/Oshlack/Corset/wiki","name":"Corset","version":["1"]}}
