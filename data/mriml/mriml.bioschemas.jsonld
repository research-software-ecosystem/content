      "sc:description": "We introduce a new R package ‘MrIML’ (Multi-response Interpretable Machine Learning). MrIML provides a powerful and interpretable framework that enables users to harness recent advances in machine learning to map multi-locus genomic relationships, to identify loci of interest for future landscape genetics studies and to gain new insights into adaptation across environmental gradients. Relationships between genetic change and environment are often non-linear, interactive and autocorrelated. Our package helps capture this complexity and offers functions that construct, fit and conduct inference on a wide range of highly flexible models that are routinely used for single-locus landscape genetics studies but are rarely extended to estimate response functions for multiple loci",
