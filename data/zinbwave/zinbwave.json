Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful high-throughput technique that enables researchers to measure genome-wide transcription levels at the resolution of single cells. Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.", "citationCount": 21, "authors": [{"name": "Risso D."}, {"name": "Perraudeau F."}, {"name": "Gribkova S."}, {"name": "Dudoit S."}, {"name": "Vert J.-P."}], "date": "2018-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Communications"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Davide Risso", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "risso.davide@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:zinbwave", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/zinbwave.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2945"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Implements a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model that can be used to provide a low-dimensional representations of single-cell RNA-seq data.
