At present, most ChIP-seq analysis tools adopt the command line, which lacks user-friendly interfaces. Although some web services with graphical interfaces have been developed for ChIP-seq analysis, these sites cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of ChIP-seq from raw data to downstream analysis. Results: In this study, we develop a web service for the whole process of ChIP-Seq Analysis (CSA), which covers mapping, quality control, peak calling, and downstream analysis. In addition, CSA provides a customization function for users to define their own workflows. And the visualization of mapping, peak calling, motif finding, and pathway analysis results are also provided in CSA. For the different types of ChIP-seq datasets, CSA can provide the corresponding tool to perform the analysis. Moreover, CSA can detect differences in ChIP signals between ChIP samples and controls to identify absolute binding sites. Conclusions: The two case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of CSA, which can complete the whole procedure of ChIP-seq analysis. CSA provides a web interface for users, and implements the visualization of every analysis step. The website of CSA is available at http://CompuBio.csu.edu.cn",
