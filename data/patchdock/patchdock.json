The method is based on local shape feature matching, avoiding the exhaustive search of the 6D transformation space. Our experiments at CAPRI rounds 1 and 2 show that although the method does not perform an exhaustive search of the 6D transformation space, the \"correct\" solution is never lost. However, such a solution might rank low for large proteins, because there are alternatives with significantly larger geometrically compatible interfaces. In many cases this problem can be resolved by successful a priori focusing on the vicinity of potential binding sites as well as the extension of the technique to flexible (hinge-bent) docking. This is demonstrated in the experiments performed as a lesson from our CAPRI experience. \u00a9 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "citationCount": 181, "authors": [{"name": "Schneidman-Duhovny D."}, {"name": "Inbar Y."}, {"name": "Polak V."}, {"name": "Shatsky M."}, {"name": "Halperin I."}, {"name": "Benyamini H."}, {"name": "Barzilai A."}, {"name": "Dror O."}, {"name": "Haspel N."}, {"name": "Nussinov R."}, {"name": "Wolfson H.J."}], "date": "2003-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proteins: Structure, Function and Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "PatchDock Administrator", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "duhovka@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:patchdock", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/PatchDock/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein-ligand docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0482"}, {"term": "Protein structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2487"}, {"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}, {"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}, {"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-11-01T12:56:34Z", "otherID": [], "description": "PatchDock is an algorithm for molecular docking.
