Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Osteochondrosis dissecans (OCD) is a degenerative disease of the cartilage leading to osseous fragments in the joints. It is important in horse breeding both from an animal welfare and an economic perspective. To study adequate breeding strategies to reduce OCD prevalence, a lifelike simulation of the breeding program of German Warmblood horses was performed with the R package MoBPS. We simulated complex breeding schemes of riding horses with different selection steps and realistic age structure, mimicking the German situation. As an example, osseous fragments in fetlock and hock joints were considered. Different scenarios, either using threshold selection, index selection or genomic index selection, respectively, were compared regarding their impact on health and performance traits. A rigorous threshold selection as well as the integration of OCD in a selection index at the stage of stallion licensing and chosen frequency of use in breeding cases on a selection index that includes breeding values for OCD traits performed best on a comparable level. Simply integrating OCD in this breeding value was less effective in terms of OCD reduction. Scenarios with a higher reduction of OCD also showed a slightly reduced improvement in the riding horse performance traits.",
