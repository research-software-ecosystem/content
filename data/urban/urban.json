    "description": "Annually Modelling Built-settlements between Remotely-sensed Observations Using Relative Changes in Subnational Populations and Lights at Night.\n\nMapping settlement extents at the annual time step has a wide variety of applications in demography, public health, sustainable development, and many other fields. Recently, while more multitemporal urban feature or human settlement datasets have become available, issues still exist in remotely-sensed imagery due to coverage, adverse atmospheric conditions, and expenses involved in producing such feature sets. These challenges make it difficult to increase temporal coverage while maintaining high fidelity in the spatial resolution. Here we demonstrate an interpolative and flexible modeling framework for producing annual built-settlement extents.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'interpolative', 'dasymetric', 'remotely-sensed', 'remotely-sensed imagery'",
