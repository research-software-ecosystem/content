The tool should enhance consistent reporting of pharmacist patient care interventions. Tool use in pharmacist-patient care intervention reporting may increase: (1) likelihood for inclusion in higher order analyses and (2) successful replication. METHODS:Adhering to principles of the Equator Network, a modified Delphi approach was used. An expert group identified guidance need, conducted a thorough literature search confirming need, developed a comprehensive list of potential elements, refined the list via multiple rounds, finalized language and structure, and published the checklist",
