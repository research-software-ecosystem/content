Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) is revolutionizing cell biology since it enables fast, high-resolution extended imaging in three dimensions combined with a drastic reduction in photo-toxicity and bleaching. However, analysis of such datasets still remains a major challenge. Results: Automated tracking of kinetochores, the protein complex facilitating and controlling microtubule attachment of the chromosomes within the mitotic spindle, provides quantitative assessment of chromosome dynamics in mitosis. Here, we extend existing open-source kinetochore tracking software (KiT) to track (and pair) kinetochores throughout prometaphase to anaphase in LLSM data. One of the key improvements is a regularization term in the objective function to enforce biological information about the number of kinetochores in a human mitotic cell, as well as improved diagnostic tools. This software provides quantitative insights into how kinetochores robustly ensure congression and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis.",

Published by Oxford University Press.During mitosis, chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle via large protein complexes called kinetochores. The motion of kinetochores throughout mitosis is intricate and automated quantitative tracking of their motion has already revealed many surprising facets of their behaviour. Here, we present 'KiT' (Kinetochore Tracking) - an easy-to-use, open-source software package for tracking kinetochores from live-cell fluorescent movies. KiT supports 2D, 3D and multi-colour movies, quantification of fluorescence, integrated deconvolution, parallel execution and multiple algorithms for particle localization. Availability and implementation: KiT is free, open-source software implemented in MATLAB and runs on all MATLAB supported platforms. KiT can be downloaded as a package from http://www.mechanochemistry.org/mcainsh/software.php. The source repository is available at https://bitbucket.org/jarmond/kit and under continuing development.",
