                "abstract": "Knowledge of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is critical to understanding the important biological functions of RNAs. Although various structure prediction models have been developed, the high-accuracy predictions of RNA 3D structures are still limited to the RNAs with short lengths or with simple topology. In this work, we proposed a new model, namely FebRNA, for building RNA 3D structures through fragment assembly based on coarse-grained (CG) fragment ensembles. Specifically, FebRNA is composed of four processes: establishing the library of different types of non-redundant CG fragment ensembles regardless of the sequences, building CG 3D structure ensemble through fragment assembly, identifying top-scored CG structures through a specific CG scoring function, and rebuilding the all-atom structures from the top-scored CG ones. Extensive examination against different types of RNA structures indicates that FebRNA consistently gives the reliable predictions on RNA 3D structures, including pseudoknots, three-way junctions, four-way and five-way junctions, and RNAs in the RNA-Puzzles. FebRNA is available on the Web site: https://github.com/Tan-group/FebRNA.",
