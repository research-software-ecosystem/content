description: 'MicrobeGPS is a bioinformatics tool for the analysis of metagenomic
  sequencing data. The goal is to profile the composition of metagenomic communities
  as accurately as possible and present the results to the user in a convenient manner.
  One main focus is reliability: the tool calculates quality metrics for the estimated
  candidates and allows the user to identify false candidates easily.'
