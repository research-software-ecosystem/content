summary: explorative taxonomic profiling tool for metagenomic data
description: >
   MicrobeGPS is a bioinformatics tool for the analysis of metagenomic
   sequencing data. The goal is to profile the composition of metagenomic
   communities as accurately as possible and present the results to the
   user in a convenient manner. One main focus is reliability: the tool
   calculates quality metrics for the estimated candidates and allows the
   user to identify false candidates easily.
