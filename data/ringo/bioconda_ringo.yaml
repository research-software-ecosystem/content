description: The package Ringo facilitates the primary analysis of ChIP-chip data.
  The main functionalities of the package are data read-in, quality assessment, data
  visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip.
  The package has functions to deal with two-color oligonucleotide microarrays from
  NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains more general functions for
  ChIP-chip data analysis, given that the data is supplied as RGList (raw) or ExpressionSet
  (pre- processed). The package employs functions from various other packages of the
  Bioconductor project and provides additional ChIP-chip-specific and NimbleGen-specific
  functionalities.
