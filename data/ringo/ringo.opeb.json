Its main functionalities are data read-in, quality assessment, data visualisation and identification of genomic regions showing enrichment in ChIP-chip. It has functions to deal with two-color nucleotide microarrays from NimbleGen used in ChIP-chip projects, but also contains more general functions for ChIP-chip data analysis, given that the data is supplied as RGList or ExpressionSet. It employs functions from various other packages.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Ringo.html","name":"Ringo","version":["1.38.0"]}}
