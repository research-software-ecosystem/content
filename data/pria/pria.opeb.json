Here, we propose a novel Polymerization Retardation Isothermal Amplification (PRIA) strategy to directly amplify the minute differences between epigenetic bases and others by arranging DNA polymerase to repetitively pass large electron-withdrawing groups tagged 5mC-oxides","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31418020","name":"PRIA"}}
