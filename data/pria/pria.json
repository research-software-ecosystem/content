    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Polymerization Retardation Isothermal Amplification', '5hmC', '5hmC 5fC', '5fC' | a strategy enables sensitively quantify genome-wide 5-methylcytosine oxides rapidly on handy instruments with nanoscale sample input | The current methods for quantifying genome-wide 5-methylcytosine (5mC) oxides are still scarce, mostly restricted with two limitations: assay sensitivity is seriously compromised with cost, assay time and sample input; epigenetic information is irreproducible during polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification without bisulfite pretreatment. Here, we propose a novel Polymerization Retardation Isothermal Amplification (PRIA) strategy to directly amplify the minute differences between epigenetic bases and others by arranging DNA polymerase to repetitively pass large electron-withdrawing groups tagged 5mC-oxides",
