FMAP stands for F FT-based M odeling of A tomistic P rotein-protein interactions. In FMAPB2, we express terms of the protein-protein inteaction energy as correlation functions, and evaluate them by FFT. These terms include steric repulsion, nonpolar attraction (in the form of a Lennard-Jones potential), and electrostatic interactions (in the form of a Debye-H&#252ckel potential)",
