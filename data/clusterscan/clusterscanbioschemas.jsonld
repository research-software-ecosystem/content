  "sc:description": "ClusterScan is a tool to search for genomic clusters starting from genomic feature locations and their annotations. It allows the user to scan an annotation file (BED format with locations of specific features such as gene, transcripts, regulatory regions or anything that can be mapped on a genome) and get clusters coordinates in output. In order to build annotated clusters, ClusterScan needs an additional two-columns file, storing the feature ids and the corresponding categorical information (such as Gene Ontology classes, KEGG, Pfam accessions, etc).",
