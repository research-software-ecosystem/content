                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The Author(s).Background: Histone post-translational modifications play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and are known to be associated with the phenotypic differences of different cell types. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to dissect the genes and pathways involved in such a phenotypic variation at the level of epigenetics. However, the existing comparative approaches are largely based on the differences, especially the absolute difference in the levels of individual histone modifications of genes under contrasting conditions. Thus, a method for measuring the overall change in the epigenetic circumstance of each gene underpinned by multiple types of histone modifications between cell types is lacking. Results: To address this challenge, we developed ICGEC, a new method for estimating the degree of epigenetic conservation of genes between two cell lines. Different from existing comparative methods, ICGEC provides a reliable score for measuring the relative change in the epigenetic context of corresponding gene between two conditions and simultaneously produces a score for each histone mark. The application of ICGEC to the human embryonic stem cell line H1 and four H1-derived cell lines with available epigenomic data for the same 16 types of histone modifications indicated high robustness and reliability of ICGEC. Furthermore, the analysis of the epigenetically dynamic and conserved genes which were defined based on the ICGEC output results demonstrated that ICGEC can deepen our understanding of the biological processes of cell differentiation to overcome the limitations of traditional expression analysis. Specifically, the ICGEC-derived differentiation-direction-specific genes were shown to have putative functions that are well-matched with cell identity. Additionally, H3K79me1 and H3K27ac were found to be the main histone marks accounting for whether an epigenetically dynamic gene was differentially expressed between two cell lines. Conclusions: The use of ICGEC creates a convenient and robust way to measure the overall epigenetic conservation of individual genes and marks between two conditions. Thus, it provides a basis for exploring the epigenotype-phenotype relationship. ICGEC can be deemed a state-of-the-art method tailored for comparative epigenomic analysis of changes in cell dynamics.",
