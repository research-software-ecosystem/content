                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020, The Author(s).In this work, we present an innovative and cost-effective approach to run ambulatory assessment (AA) studies on participants\u2019 smartphones via Telegram Messenger. Our approach works both for Android and iOS devices. The population of potential participants in a given country or region consists of all individuals who (a) are in possession of a smartphone, (b) are willing to install Telegram Messenger, and (c) live in an environment providing constant connection to the Internet. In our new approach to AA, participants are asked to subscribe to a Telegram chatbot that provides them with links to brief surveys at specified points in time in their everyday lives via short notifications. We developed a user-friendly Python script that allows for the flexible editing of the chatbot\u2019s settings, e.g., the number of surveys per day. All common survey software designed for mobile devices can be used to present surveys to participants. This means that data collection takes place exclusively via the selected survey software, not via Telegram. With our approach, AA studies can be carried out among iOS and Android users cost-effectively and reliably while data security is ensured. Initial data from a pilot study show that studies of this kind are feasible, and the procedure is accepted by participants.
