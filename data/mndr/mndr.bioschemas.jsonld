Here, we have updated the MNDR to version 3.1 by integrating experimentally supported and predicted ncRNA-disease associations curated from manual literatures and other resources. MNDR v3.1 currently contains more than one million ncRNA-disease entries, including 6,301 miRNAs, 39,880 lncRNAs, 20,256 circRNAs, 10,894 piRNAs and 521 snoRNAs with over 1,600 diseases, and an increase of species coverage to 11 mammals.",
