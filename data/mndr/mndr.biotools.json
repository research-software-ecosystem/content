    "description": "Mammal ncRNA-disease repository with increased coverage and annotation.\n\nMammalian ncRNA-Disease Repository.\n\nMNDR v3.1: Mammal NcRNA-Disease Repository.\n\nMNDR (Mammalian ncRNA-Disease Repository) is a database that curated associations between ncRNA and disease. Here, we have updated the MNDR to version 3.1 by integrating experimentally supported and predicted ncRNA-disease associations curated from manual literatures and other resources. MNDR v3.1 currently contains more than one million ncRNA-disease entries, including 6,301 miRNAs, 39,880 lncRNAs, 20,256 circRNAs, 10,894 piRNAs and 521 snoRNAs with over 1,600 diseases, and an increase of species coverage to 11 mammals.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Many studies have indicated that non-coding RNA (ncRNA) dysfunction is closely related to numerous diseases. Recently, accumulated ncRNA-disease associations have made related databases insufficient to meet the demands of biomedical research. The constant updating of ncRNA-disease resources has become essential. Here, we have updated the mammal ncRNA-disease repository (MNDR, http://www.rna-society.org/mndr/) to version 3.0, containing more than one million entries, four-fold increment in data compared to the previous version. Experimental and predicted circRNA-disease associations have been integrated, increasing the number of categories of ncRNAs to five, and the number of mammalian species to 11. Moreover, ncRNA-disease related drug annotations and associations, as well as ncRNA subcellular localizations and interactions, were added. In addition, three ncRNA-disease (miRNA/lncRNA/circRNA) prediction tools were provided, and the website was also optimized, making it more practical and user-friendly. In summary, MNDR v3.0 will be a valuable resource for the investigation of disease mechanisms and clinical treatment strategies.",
