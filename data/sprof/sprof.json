    "description": "To Improve Protein Sequence Profile Prediction through Image Captioning on Pairwise Residue Distance Map.\n\nProtein sequence profile prediction aims to generate multiple sequences from structural information to advance the protein design. Protein sequence profile can be computationally predicted by energy-based method or fragment-based methods. By integrating these methods with neural networks, our previous method, SPIN2 has achieved a sequence recovery rate of 34%. However, SPIN2 employed only one dimensional (1D) structural properties that are not sufficient to represent 3D structures. In this study, we represented 3D structures by 2D maps of pairwise residue distances. and developed a new method (SPROF) to predict protein sequence profile based on an image captioning learning frame. To our best knowledge, this is the first method to employ 2D distance map for predicting protein properties.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'sequence profile', 'biomed', 'SPIN2'",
