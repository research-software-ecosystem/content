In its current state, the database employs an easy-to-use, searchable interface for obtaining detailed data on the 109 currentlyknown RNA modifications. Each entry provides the chemical structure, common name and symbol,elemental composition and mass, CA registry numbers and index name, phylogenetic source, type of RNA species in which it is found, and references to the first reported structure determination and synthesis. Though newly transferred in itsentirety to The RNA Institute, the RNAMDB continues to grow with two notable additions, agmatidine and8-methyladenosine, appended in the last year. The RNA Modification Database is staying up-to-date with significant improvements being prepared for inclusion within the next year and the following year. The expanded future role of The RNA Modification Database will be to serve as a primary information portal for researchers across the entire spectrum of RNA-related research. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.",
