description: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Data Portal provides a platform for researchers
  to search, download, and analyze data sets generated by TCGA. It contains clinical
  information, genomic characterization data, and high level sequence analysis of
  the tumor genomes. The key is to understand genomics to improve cancer care. RTCGA
  package offers download and integration of the variety and volume of TCGA data using
  patient barcode key, what enables easier data possession. This may have an benefcial
  infuence on impact on development of science and improvement of patients' treatment.
  Furthermore, RTCGA package transforms TCGA data to tidy form which is convenient
  to use.
