  "sc:description": "SAVoR webserver allows the user to visualize RNA-seq data and other genomic annotations on RNA secondary structures. SAVoR is designed to help researchers visualize sequencing data in the context of RNA secondary structures. Useful if you want to see the distribution of smRNA-seq reads along a microRNA precursor, how a set of SNPs might impact RNA structure, or in a control vs. treatment sequencing experiments you would like to see regions of enrichment along an RNA structure.",
