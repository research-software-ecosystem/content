Given a matrix of one-sided p-values, it uses meta-analytic methods to combine p-values for all genes annotated to each gene set, and then classify them as significantly more active, less active, or not significantly differentially active in each contrast of interest. With multiple contrasts of interest, each gene set is assigned to a profile of differential activity.",
