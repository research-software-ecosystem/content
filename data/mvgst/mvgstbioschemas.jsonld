  "sc:description": "Platform-independent tools to identify GO terms that are differentially active in multiple contrasts of interest. Given a matrix of one-sided p-values, it uses meta-analytic methods to combine p-values for all genes annotated to each gene set, and then classify them as significantly more active, less active, or not significantly differentially active in each contrast of interest. With multiple contrasts of interest, each gene set is assigned to a profile of differential activity.",
