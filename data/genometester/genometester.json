The eukaryotic genomes are particularly difficult to study due to abundant repeats. The speed of most existing primer evaluation programs is not sufficient for large-scale experiments. Results: In order to improve the efficiency and success rate of automatic primer/oligo design, we created a novel method which allows rapid masking of repeats in large sequence files, for example in eukaryotic genomes. It also allows the detection of all alternative binding sites of PCR primers and the prediction of PCR products. The new method was implemented in a collection of efficient programs, the GENOMEMASKER package. The performance of the programs was compared to other similar programs. We also modified the PRIMER3 program, to be able to design primers from lowercase-masked sequences. Conclusion: The GENO MEMASKER package is able to mask the entire human genome for non-unique primers within 6 hours and find locations of all binding sites for 10 000 designed primer pairs within 10 minutes. Additionally, it predicts all alternative PCR products from large genomes for given primer pairs. \u00a9 2006 Andreson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 24, "authors": [{"name": "Andreson R."}, {"name": "Reppo E."}, {"name": "Kaplinski L."}, {"name": "Remm M."}], "date": "2006-03-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ELIXIR-EE", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Reidar Andreson", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "reidar.andreson@ut.ee"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:genometester", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo.ut.ee/genometester", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "PCR primers", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1240"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Virtual PCR", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0307"}, {"term": "Sequence database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0338"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Nucleic acid features", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1276"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Analyse whether PCR primers have excessive number of binding sites in large genomes, how many PCR products would be amplified in the reaction and where are they located.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "genometester", "additionDate": "2015-01-22T11:13:21Z", "name": "GenomeTester", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinfo.ut.ee/genometester/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
