                "abstract": "With the growing number of experimentally resolved structures of macromolecular complexes, it becomes clear that the interactions that involve protein structures are mediated not only by the protein domains, but also by various non-structured regions, such as interdomain linkers, or terminal sequences. Here, we present DOMMINO (http:// dommino.org), a comprehensive database of macromolecular interactions that includes the interactions between protein domains, interdomain linkers, N- and C-terminal regions and protein peptides. The database complements SCOP domain annotations with domain predictions by SUPERFAMILY and is automatically updated every week. The database interface is designed to provide the user with a three-stage pipeline to study macromolecular interactions: (i) a flexible search that can include a PDB ID, type of interaction, SCOP family of interacting proteins, organism name, interaction keyword and a minimal threshold on the number of contact pairs; (ii) visualization of subunit interaction network, where the user can investigate the types of interactions within a macromolecular assembly; and (iii) visualization of an interface structure between any pair of the interacting subunits, where the user can highlight several different types of residues within the interfaces as well as study the structure of the corresponding binary complex of subunits. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.",
