A number of workflows and software packages have been created to process and analyze single-cell transcriptomic data. These packages allow users to take the vast dimensionality of the data generated in single-cell-based experiments and distill the data into novel insights. Unlike the transcriptomic field, there is a lack of options for software that allow for single-cell immune receptor profiling. Enabling users to easily combine mRNA and immune profiling, scRepertoire was built to process data derived from 10x Genomics Chromium Immune Profiling for both T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) enrichment workflows and subsequently interacts with a number of popular R packages for single-cell expression, such as Seurat. The scRepertoire R package and processed data are open source and available on GitHub and provides in-depth tutorials on the capability of the package.",
