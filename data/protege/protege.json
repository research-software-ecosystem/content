It contains several features to aid collaboration, including support for the discussion of issues, change notification and revision-based change tracking. WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 also features a simple user interface, which is geared towards editing the kinds of class descriptions and annotations that are prevalent throughout biomedical ontologies. Moreover, it is possible to configure the user interface using views that are optimized for editing Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) class descriptions and metadata. Some of these views are shown in the Supplementary Material and can be seen in WebProt\u00e9g\u00e9 itself by configuring the project as an OBO project. \u00a9 The Author 2014.",
