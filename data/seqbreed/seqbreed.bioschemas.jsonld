  "sc:description": "a python tool to evaluate genomic prediction in complex scenarios | SeqBreed.py is a python3 software to simulate populations under (genomic) selection. It inherits most of funcionality from SBVB (Perez-Enciso et al., 2017, https://github.com/miguelperezenciso/sbvb1) and pSBVB (Zingaretti et al. 2018, https://github.com/lauzingaretti/pSBVB) softwares but code has been completely rewritten. It is now much more user friendly and adds numerous new features such as easy selection implementation (BLUP, GBLUP, SSTEP), plots (PCA, GWAS)..",
