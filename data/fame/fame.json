While these are available, subsequently running or visualizing a model often relies on disjoint code, which adds additional actions to the analysis routine and, in our experience, renders these applications suboptimal for routine use by (systems) biologists.Results: The Flux Analysis and Modeling Environment (FAME) is the first web-based modeling tool that combines the tasks of creating, editing, running, and analyzing/visualizing stoichiometric models into a single program. Analysis results can be automatically superimposed on familiar KEGG-like maps. FAME is written in PHP and uses the Python-based PySCeS-CBM for its linear solving capabilities. It comes with a comprehensive manual and a quick-start tutorial, and can be accessed online at http://f-a-m-e.org/.Conclusions: With FAME, we present the community with an open source, user-friendly, web-based \"one stop shop\" for stoichiometric modeling. We expect the application will be of substantial use to investigators and educators alike. \u00a9 2012 Boele et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 38, "authors": [{"name": "Boele J."}, {"name": "Olivier B.G."}, {"name": "Teusink B."}], "date": "2012-01-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "j.boele@vu.nl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:fame", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://f-a-m-e.fame-vu.surf-hosted.nl/ajax/page1.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Modelling and simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2426"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Flux Analysis and Modeling Environment.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "fame", "additionDate": "2018-08-19T08:53:00Z", "name": "FAME", "license": "BSD-2-Clause", "documentation": [{"url": "http://f-a-m-e.fame-vu.surf-hosted.nl/ajax/files/manual.pdf", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
