Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Protein function prediction (PFP) is an automated function prediction method that predicts Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for a protein sequence using distantly related sequences and contextual associations of GO terms. Extended similarity group (ESG) is another GO prediction algorithm that makes predictions based on iterative sequence database searches. Here, we provide interactive web servers for the PFP and ESG algorithms that are equipped with an effective visualization of the GO predictions in a hierarchical topology.","authors":["Khan I.K.","Wei Q.","Chitale M.","Kihara D."],"cit_count":11,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25273111","title":"PFP/ESG: Automated protein function prediction servers enhanced with Gene Ontology visualization tool","year":"2015-01-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pfp-go","biotoolsID":"pfp-go","description":"Sequence similarity-based protein function prediction server designed to predict GO annotations for a query sequence beyond what can be found by conventional database search such as BLAST.","homepage":"http://kiharalab.org/web/pfp.php","name":"PFP"}}
