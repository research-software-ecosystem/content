description: "PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from\
  \ alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. It provides a wide range of\
  \ options that were designed to facilitate standard phylogenetic analyses. The main\
  \ strengths of PhyML lies in the large number of substitution models coupled to\
  \ various options to search the space of phylogenetic tree topologies, going from\
  \ very fast and efficient methods to slower but generally more accurate approaches.\
  \ It also implements two methods to evaluate branch supports in a sound statistical\
  \ framework (the non-parametric bootstrap and the approximate likelihood ratio test).\
  \ . PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets. In theory, alignments\
  \ with up to 4,000 sequences 2,000,000 character-long can be analyzed. In  practice\
  \ however, the amount of memory required to process a data set is proportional of\
  \ the product of the number of sequences by their length. Hence, a large number\
  \ of sequences can only be processed provided that they are short. Also, PhyML can\
  \ handle long sequences provided that they are not numerous. With most standard\
  \ personal computers, the \u201Ccomfort zone\u201D for PhyML generally lies around\
  \ 3 to 500 sequences less than 2,000 character long. . This package also includes\
  \ PhyTime.\n"
