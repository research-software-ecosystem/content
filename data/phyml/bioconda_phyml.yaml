description: "PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from\n\
  alignments of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The main strength of\nPhyML lies\
  \ in the large number of substitution models coupled to various\noptions to search\
  \ the space of phylogenetic tree topologies, going from\nvery fast and efficient\
  \ methods to slower but generally more accurate\napproaches. PhyML was designed\
  \ to process moderate to large data sets. In\ntheory, alignments with up to 4,000\
  \ sequences 2,000,000 character-long\ncan be processed. PhyML can process data sets\
  \ made of multiple genes and\nfit sophisticated substitution models with heterogeneous\
  \ components\nacross partition elements.\n"
