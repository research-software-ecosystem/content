  "sc:description": "A package based on the Genome Analysis Toolkit map-reduce framework for genotyping in bisulfite treated massively parallel sequencing on Illumina platform. It uses bayesian inference with either manually specified or automatically estimated methylation probabilities of different cytosine context(not only CpG, CHH, CHG in Bisulfite-seq, but also GCH et.al. in other bisulfite treated sequencing) to determine genotypes and methylation levels simultaneously.",
