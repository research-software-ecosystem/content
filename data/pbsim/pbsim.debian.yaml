summary: simulator for PacBio sequencing reads
description: >
   PacBio DNA sequencers produce two types of characteristic reads: CCS
   (short and low error rate) and CLR (long and high error rate), both of
   which could be useful for de novo assembly of genomes. PBSIM simulates
   those PacBio reads from a reference sequence by using either a model-based
   or sampling-based simulation. Simulated reads are useful, for example, when
   developing or evaluating sequence assemblers targeted at PacBio data.
