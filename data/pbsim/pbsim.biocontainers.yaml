description: 'Pacbio sequencers produced two types of characteristic reads: ccs (short
  and low error rate) and clr (long and high error rate), both of which could be useful
  for de novo assembly of genomes. this tool simulates those pacbio reads by using
  either a model-based or sampling-based simulation.'
