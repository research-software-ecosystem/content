This makes it possible to use the programs without having to download the code and get the programs to run. The results of all the programs are presented on a webpage and can easily be downloaded for further analysis. Additional measures are calculated for each program to make it easier to judge the individual predictions, and a consensus prediction taking all the programs into account is also calculated. This website is free and open to all users and there is no login requirement.
