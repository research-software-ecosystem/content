      "sc:description": "The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive tool that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets.\n\nBy integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the Open Targets consortium, the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases, phenotypes, and drugs, as well as their most relevant relationships.\n\nThe Platform is a freely available resource that is actively maintained with bi-monthly updates. The data can be accessed through an intuitive web user interface, an API, Google BigQuery, and a comprehensive set of datasets available for download in JSON and Parquet formats. The pipeline and infrastructure codebases that support the Platform are open-source and can be used to create a self-hosted private instance of the Platform with custom data.",
