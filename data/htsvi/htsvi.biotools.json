However, exploratory data analysis and integration of screening results has remained challenging due to the size of the data sets and the lack of user-friendly tools for interpretation and visualization of screening results. Here we present HTSvis, a web application to interactively visualize raw data, perform quality control and assess screening results from single to multi-channel measurements such as image-based screens. Per well aggregated raw and analyzed data of various assay types and scales can be loaded in a generic tabular format. Availability and implementation: HTSvis is distributed as an open-source R package, downloadable from https://github.com/boutroslab/HTSvis and can also be accessed at http://htsvis.dkfz.de.",
