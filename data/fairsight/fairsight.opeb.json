In response, researchers have made efforts to propose and implement fairness measures and algorithms, but those efforts have not been translated to the real-world practice of data-driven decision making. As such, there is still an urgent need to create a viable tool to facilitate fair decision making. We propose FairSight, a visual analytic system to address this need; it is designed to achieve different notions of fairness in ranking decisions through identifying the required actions - understanding, measuring, diagnosing and mitigating biases - that together lead to fairer decision making","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31425083","name":"FairSight"}}
