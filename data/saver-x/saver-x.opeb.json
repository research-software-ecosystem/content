Here, we show that transfer learning across datasets remarkably improves data quality. By coupling a deep autoencoder with a Bayesian model, SAVER-X extracts transferable gene−gene relationships across data from different labs, varying conditions and divergent species, to denoise new target datasets.","authors":["Wang J.","Agarwal D.","Huang M.","Hu G.","Zhou Z.","Ye C.","Zhang N.R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1038/S41592-019-0537-1","journal":"Nature Methods","pmid":"31471617","title":"Data denoising with transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics","year":"2019-09-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:SAVER-X","biotoolsID":"SAVER-X","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | Data denoising with transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics | R package for transfer learning of single-cell RNA-seq denoising | SAVER-X – Laboratory for single Cell data science | R package for transfer learning of scRNA-seq denoising.
