    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | Data denoising with transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics | R package for transfer learning of single-cell RNA-seq denoising | SAVER-X \u2013 Laboratory for single Cell data science | R package for transfer learning of scRNA-seq denoising. Take a look at our free SAVER-X web-server for the transfer learning online computation! We also encourage you to read our pre-print manucript for more information. You can also refer to our earlier denoising method SAVER | Laboratory for single Cell data science | Where Statistics, Biology and Computer Science Meet | Uploading Data is as Easy as 1-2-3: | Researchers can directly upload their data of UMI counts to the web portal as a (gene x cell) matrix stored in a .csv, .txt or .rds file. Our cloud service does not store the user\u2019s data or use it for any other purpose besides denoising | In most single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) studies, the data are extremely sparse and noisy, hindering downstream analyses",

Here, we show that transfer learning across datasets remarkably improves data quality. By coupling a deep autoencoder with a Bayesian model, SAVER-X extracts transferable gene\u2212gene relationships across data from different labs, varying conditions and divergent species, to denoise new target datasets.",
