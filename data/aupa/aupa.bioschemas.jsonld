      "sc:description": "Design a prototype for automated patient diagnosis in wireless sensor networks | It is indeed necessary to design of an elderly support mobile healthcare and monitoring system on wireless sensor network (WSN) for dynamic monitoring. It comes from the need for maintenance of healthcare among patients and elderly people that leads to the demand on change in traditional monitoring approaches among chronic disease patients and alert on acute events. In this paper, we propose a new automated patient diagnosis called automated patient diagnosis (AUPA) using ATmega microcontrollers over environmental sensors. AUPA monitors and aggregates data from patients through network connected over web server and mobile network. The scheme supports variable data management and route establishment. Data transfer is established using adaptive route discovery and management approaches",
