                "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern. The lack of innovations in antibiotic development has led to renewed interest in antibiotic adjuvants. However, there is no database to collect antibiotic adjuvants. Herein, we build a comprehensive database named Antibiotic Adjuvant DataBase (AADB) by manually collecting relevant literature. Specifically, AADB includes 3,035 combinations of antibiotics with adjuvants, covering 83 antibiotics, 226 adjuvants, and 325 bacterial strains. AADB provides user-friendly interfaces for searching and downloading. Users can easily obtain these datasets for further analysis. In addition, we also collected related datasets (e.g., chemogenomic and metabolomic data) and proposed a computational strategy to dissect these datasets. As a test case, we identified 10 candidates for minocycline, and 6 of 10 candidates are the known adjuvants that synergize with minocycline to inhibit the growth of E. coli BW25113. We hope that AADB can help users to identify effective antibiotic adjuvants. AADB is freely available at http://www.acdb.plus/AADB.",
