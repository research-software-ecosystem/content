      "sc:description": "A random forest method for prediction of N-Glycosylation sites in eukaryotic protein sequence.\n\nN-Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational mechanisms in eukaryotes. It plays a vital role in various biological processes such as protein folding, stability, immunogenicity of different proteins, cell signaling and protein targeting. N-glycosylation predominantly occurs in N-X-[S T] sequon where X is any amino acid other than proline. However, not all N-X-[S T] sequons in proteins are glycosylated. Therefore, accurate prediction of N-glycosylation sites is essential to understand N-glycosylation mechanism. We developed a random forest method, Nglyc, to predict N-glycosylation sites in eukaryotic protein sequences. The method used 315 features derived from a protein sequence and its sequence homologs. Training and testing was performed using a dataset containing 895 N-glycosylation sites and 853 non-glycosylated sites obtained from 846 PDB structures",
