  "sc:description": "Integrative Modeling Platform broad goal is to contribute to a comprehensive structural characterization of biomolecules ranging in size and complexity from small peptides to large macromolecular assemblies. Detailed structural characterization of assemblies is generally impossible by any single existing experimental or computational method. This barrier can be overcome by hybrid approaches that integrate data from diverse biochemical and biophysical experiments.",
