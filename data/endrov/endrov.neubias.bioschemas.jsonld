  "http://schema.org/description": "\r\nEndrov started development in 2007 by Johan Henriksson in the group of Thomas Bürglin group / Karolinska insitutet. At that time it was merely a tool to support the analysis of C. elegans embryogenesis. It was decided to not base it on ImageJ because little of it could be reused, many of the problems came from the core design. Since then the scope of Endrov has expanded to be useful for all image processing and be able to replace ImageJ.\r\n",
