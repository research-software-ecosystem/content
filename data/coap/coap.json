Designed and developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), it functions as an application layer protocol and benefits from reliable delivery and simple congestion control. It is implemented for request response message exchanges over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) to support the Internet of Things (IoT). CoAP also provides a basic congestion control mechanism. In dealing with its own congestion, it relies on a fixed interval retransmission timeout (RTO) and binary exponential backoff (BEB)",
