    "description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | an eXtreme Gradient Boosting based method for identifying pseudouridine sites | As one of the most popular post-transcriptional modifications, pseudouridine (\u03a8) participates in a series of biological processes. Therefore, the efficient detection of pseudouridine sites is very important in revealing its functions in biological processes. Although experimental techniques have been proposed for identifying \u03a8 sites at single-base resolution, they are still labor intensive and expensive. Recently, to fill the experimental method's gap, computational methods have been proposed for identifying \u03a8 sites. However, their performances are still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we proposed an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xgboost)-based method, called XG-PseU, to identify \u03a8 sites based on the optimal features obtained using the forward feature selection together with increment feature selection method",
