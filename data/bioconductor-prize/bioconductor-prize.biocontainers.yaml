description: This tool offers a novel approach to narrow down long lists of candidates
  by prioritizing them based on how well they meet the research goal. it organizes
  and analyzes complex decisions where multiple criteria are involved. the technique
  structures problems into a hierarchy of elements, and helps to specify numerical
  weights representing the relative importance of each element.
