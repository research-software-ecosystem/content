    "description": "Conducting multiple statistical tests increases the likelihood that a significant proportion of associations will be false positives, clouding real discoveries. Several strategies exist to overcome the problem of multiple hypothesis testing. Our multiple testing correction tool provides the five most frequently used adjustment tools to solve the problem of multiple hypothesis testing, including the Bonferroni, the Holm (step-down), the Hochberg (step-up) corrections, and allows to calculate the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and q-values.",
