    "description": "Multipletesting.com is a user-friendly online tool designed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing, helping researchers minimize false positives when performing numerous statistical tests. It supports five widely used correction methods—Bonferroni, Holm, Hochberg, FDR, and q-value—making it an essential resource for reliable data interpretation in life sciences.\n\nKey features include:\n•\tInput: simple list of p-values, total number of tests, and significance level (alpha)\n\n•\tOutput: adjusted p-values based on selected correction method\n•\tIntegrated calculators for each method with clear explanations and use-case examples\nIt is particularly valuable for genomic, transcriptomic, or other high-throughput studies where many tests are performed simultaneously.",
