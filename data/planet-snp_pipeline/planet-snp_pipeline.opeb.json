For the extraction of profitable information from bulk of data, machine learning (ML) could lead to development of accurate model based on the learning of prior information. We performed state of art, in-depth learning on six different plant species. Comparative evaluation of five different algorithms showed that Random Forest substantially outperformed in selection of potential SNPs, with markedly improved prediction accuracy via 10-fold cross validation technique and integrated in system known as PLANET-SNP. We present the accurate method to extract the potential SNPs with user specific customizable parameters. It will facilitate the identification of efficient and functional SNPs in most easy and intuitive way. PLANET-SNP pipeline is very flexible in terms of data input and output formats.
