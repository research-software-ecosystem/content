      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | PLants based ANnotation and Establishment of True SNP pipeline | Acute prediction of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) from high throughput sequencing data is a challenging problem, having potential to explore possible variation within plants species. For the extraction of profitable information from bulk of data, machine learning (ML) could lead to development of accurate model based on the learning of prior information. We performed state of art, in-depth learning on six different plant species. Comparative evaluation of five different algorithms showed that Random Forest substantially outperformed in selection of potential SNPs, with markedly improved prediction accuracy via 10-fold cross validation technique and integrated in system known as PLANET-SNP. We present the accurate method to extract the potential SNPs with user specific customizable parameters",
