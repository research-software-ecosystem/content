      "sc:description": "d-SEAMS is a collection of analysis tools for molecular simulations. It has been implemented as a High Performance Cluster enabled engine in C++, with extensions via the Lua scripting interface. The code sheds light on the structures from simulation trajectories, in terms of their topology and it has been tailored for the analysis of nucleating systems. The framework is meant to be interfaced to a large variety of external tools and software, including R and other libraries. It is also the first and at-present only scientific analysis tool to use reproducible builds via nix.",
