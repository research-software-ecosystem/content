description: 'MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial
  communities (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes and Viruses) from metagenomic shotgun
  sequencing data with species level resolution. From version 2.0, MetaPhlAn is also
  able to identify specific strains (in the not-so-frequent cases in which the sample
  contains a previously sequenced strains) and to track strains across samples for
  all species. . MetaPhlAn 2.0 relies on ~1M unique clade-specific marker genes (the
  marker information file can be found at usr/share/metaphlan2/utils/markers_info.txt.bz2)
  identified from ~17,000 reference genomes (~13,500 bacterial and archaeal, ~3,500
  viral, and ~110 eukaryotic), allowing: . * unambiguous taxonomic assignments; *
  accurate estimation of organismal relative abundance; * species-level resolution
  for bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and viruses; * strain identification and tracking
  * orders of magnitude speedups compared to existing methods. * metagenomic strain-level
  population genomics'
