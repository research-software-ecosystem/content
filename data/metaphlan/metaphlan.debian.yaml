description: "MetaPhlAn is a computational tool for profiling the composition of microbial\
  \ communities (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes and Viruses) from metagenomic shotgun\
  \ sequencing data with species level resolution. From version 2.0, MetaPhlAn is\
  \ also able to identify specific strains (in the not-so-frequent cases in which\
  \ the sample contains a previously sequenced strains) and to track strains across\
  \ samples for all species. . MetaPhlAn 2.0 relies on ~1M unique clade-specific marker\
  \ genes (the marker information file can be found at usr/share/metaphlan2/utils/markers_info.txt.bz2)\
  \ identified from ~17,000 reference genomes (~13,500 bacterial and archaeal, ~3,500\
  \ viral, and ~110 eukaryotic), allowing: .\n * unambiguous taxonomic assignments;\n\
  \ * accurate estimation of organismal relative abundance;\n * species-level resolution\
  \ for bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes and\n   viruses;\n * strain identification and\
  \ tracking\n * orders of magnitude speedups compared to existing methods.\n * metagenomic\
  \ strain-level population genomics\n"
