An adequate description of the structural units is an important step in objective protein structure classification, which to date is based on expert judgment in a number of cases. Explicit determination and description of structural units is more complicated for \u03b2-sheets than for \u03b1-helixes due to \u03b2-sheets variability both in composition and geometry. We have developed an algorithm that can significantly modify \u03b2-sheets detected by commonly used DSSP and Stride algorithms and represent the result as a \"\u03b2-sheet map,\" a table describing certain \u03b2-sheet features. In our approach, \u03b2-sheets (rather than \u03b2-strands) are considered as holistic objects. Both hydrogen bonds and geometrical restrains are explored for the determination of \u03b2-sheets. The algorithm is implemented in SheeP program. It was tested for prediction architectures of domains from 93 well-defined all-\u03b2 and \u03b1/\u03b2 SCOP protein domain families, and showed 93% of correct results. The Web-service allows to detect \u03b2-sheets in a given protein structure, visualize \u03b2-sheet maps, as well as input three-dimensional structures with highlighted \u03b2-sheets and their structural features. \u00a9 2012 Imperial College Press.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Aksianov E."}, {"name": "Alexeevski A."}], "date": "2012-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "evaksianov@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sheep", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://mouse.belozersky.msu.ru/~evgeniy/cgi-bin/proton/proton.php?subproj=sheep", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:44Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool displays schemes of \u03b2-sheet called, draws \u03b2-sheet maps.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/sheep-2-1-description-of-\u03b2-sheets-in-protein-3d-structures.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "sheep", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:01:25Z", "name": "SheeP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://mouse.belozersky.msu.ru/~evgeniy/cgi-bin/proton/proton.php?subproj=sheep", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
