                "abstract": "The description of a protein fold is a hard problem due to significant variability of main structural units, \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helixes, and their mutual arrangements. An adequate description of the structural units is an important step in objective protein structure classification, which to date is based on expert judgment in a number of cases. Explicit determination and description of structural units is more complicated for \u03b2-sheets than for \u03b1-helixes due to \u03b2-sheets variability both in composition and geometry. We have developed an algorithm that can significantly modify \u03b2-sheets detected by commonly used DSSP and Stride algorithms and represent the result as a \"\u03b2-sheet map,\" a table describing certain \u03b2-sheet features. In our approach, \u03b2-sheets (rather than \u03b2-strands) are considered as holistic objects. Both hydrogen bonds and geometrical restrains are explored for the determination of \u03b2-sheets. The algorithm is implemented in SheeP program. It was tested for prediction architectures of domains from 93 well-defined all-\u03b2 and \u03b1/\u03b2 SCOP protein domain families, and showed 93% of correct results. The Web-service allows to detect \u03b2-sheets in a given protein structure, visualize \u03b2-sheet maps, as well as input three-dimensional structures with highlighted \u03b2-sheets and their structural features. \u00a9 2012 Imperial College Press.",
