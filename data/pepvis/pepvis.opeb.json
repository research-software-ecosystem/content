Many of the FDA-approved peptides are currently available for therapeutic applications. In the current postgenomic era, high-throughput computational screening of drugs and peptides are highly exploited in peptide therapeutics for cost-effective and robustness. However, there is a paucity of efficient pipelines that automate virtual screening process of peptides through integration of open-source tools that are optimal to perform ensemble and flexible docking protocols. Hence, in this study, we developed a GUI-based pipeline named PepVis for automated script generation for large-scale peptide modeling and virtual screening. PepVis integrates Modpep and Gromacs for peptide structure modeling and optimization; AutoDock Vina, ZDOCK, and AutoDock CrankPep for virtual screening of peptides; ZRANK2 for rescoring of protein–peptide complexes, and FlexPepDock for flexible refinement of protein–peptide complexes. Benchmarking of ensemble docking through PepVis infers that ModPep + Vina to outperform ModPep + ZDock in terms of detecting near-natives from LEADS-PEP dataset. PepVis is built modular to incorporate many other docking algorithms in the future.
