  "sc:description": "Its modifications are related to the aim of simulating the evolution of protein sequences under the constraints of the information of a particular reconstructed phylogeny. It will allow simulations to take such information into account and some control on the simulated tree / branch lengths around an average value. Finally, a particular category of applications for such simulations is the search for the significant co-evolution of sites.",
