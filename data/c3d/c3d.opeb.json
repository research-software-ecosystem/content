Motivation The 3D genome architecture influences the regulation of genes by facilitating chromatin interactions between distal cis-regulatory elements and gene promoters. We implement Cross Cell-type Correlation based on DNA accessibility (C3D), a customizable computational tool that predicts chromatin interactions using an unsupervised algorithm that utilizes correlations in chromatin measurements, such as DNaseI hypersensitivity signals. Results C3D accurately predicts 32.7%, 18.3% and 24.1% of interactions, validated by ChIA-PET assays, between promoters and distal regions that overlie DNaseI hypersensitive sites in K562, MCF-7 and GM12878 cells, respectively.","authors":["Mehdi T.","Bailey S.D.","Guilhamon P.","Lupien M."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty717","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"C3D: A tool to predict 3D genomic interactions between cis-regulatory elements","type":"Primary","year":"2019-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:C3D","biotoolsID":"C3D","description":"Cross Cell-type Correlation in DNaseI hypersensitivity (C3D) - tool to predict 3D genomic interactions between cis-regulatory elements.","homepage":"https://github.com/LupienLab/C3D","name":"C3D"}}
