  "sc:description": "This tool integrates ChIP-seq data with differential expression summary data through a Bayesian framework. A key application is identifing the genes targeted by a transcription factor of interest (that is, we collect genes that are associated with a ChIP-seq peak, and analyze the differential expression under some perturbation related to that TF).",
