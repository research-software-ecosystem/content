Despite significant efforts, currently available \u03b2-transmembrane region predictors are still limited in terms of prediction accuracy, especially in precision. Here, we describe Pred\u03b2TM, a transmembrane region prediction algorithm for \u03b2-barrel proteins. Using amino acid pair frequency information in known \u03b2-transmembrane protein sequences, we have trained a support vector machine classifier to predict \u03b2-transmembrane segments. Position-specific amino acid preference data is incorporated in the final prediction. The predictor does not incorporate evolutionary profile information explicitly, but is based on sequence patterns generated implicitly by encoding the protein segments using amino acid adjacency matrix. With a benchmark set of 35 \u03b2-transmembrane proteins, Pred\u03b2TM shows a sensitivity and precision of 83.71% and 72.98%, respectively. The segment overlap score is 82.19%. In comparison with other state-of-art methods, Pred\u03b2TM provides a higher precision and segment overlap without compromising with sensitivity. Further, we applied Pred\u03b2TM to analyze the \u03b2-barrel membrane proteins without defined transmembrane regions and the uncharacterized protein sequences in eight bacterial genomes and predict possible \u03b2-transmembrane proteins.

A transmembrane protein bilitranslocase (TCDB 2.A.65) has long attracted attention because of its function as an organic anion carrier. It has also been identified as a potential membrane transporter for cellular uptake of several drugs and due to its implication in drug uptake, it is extremely important to advance the knowledge about its structure. However, at present, only the primary structure of bilitranslocase is known. In our work, transmembrane subunits of bilitranslocase were predicted by a previously developed chemometrics model and the stability of these polypeptide chains were studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Furthermore, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles were used as a model of cell membrane and herein we present a high-resolution 3D structure of an 18 amino acid residues long peptide corresponding to the third transmembrane part of bilitranslocase obtained by use of multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. It has been experimentally confirmed that one of the transmembrane segments of bilitranslocase has alpha helical structure with hydrophilic amino acid residues oriented towards one side, thus capable of forming a channel in the membrane. \u00a9 2012 Perdih et al.", "citationCount": 10, "authors": [{"name": "Perdih A."}, {"name": "Choudhury A."}, {"name": "Zuperl S."}, {"name": "Sikorska E."}, {"name": "Zhukov I."}, {"name": "Solmajer T."}, {"name": "Novic M."}], "date": "2012-06-20T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ELIXIR-SI-hackathon", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Marjana Novi\u010d", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "marjana.novic@ki.si"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:predtm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://transpred.ki.si", "function": [{"note": "Prediction of protein transmembrane domains The allowed input format is plain text or FASTA format. \nA correct protein sequence should contain only the one letter abbreviations of the 20 natural amino acids.
