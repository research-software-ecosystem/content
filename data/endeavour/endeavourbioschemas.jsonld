  "sc:description": "ENDEAVOUR is a computational approach to prioritize candidate genes for further study. Users input training genes already known to be involved in the process under study and the candidate genes to prioritize. The web server supports multiple species and integrates multiple genomic data to generate the final prioritization.  ENDEAVOUR has been benchmarked in silico and experimentally validated leading to the discovery of novel disease genes in several genetic diseases.",
