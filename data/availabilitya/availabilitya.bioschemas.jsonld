  "sc:description": "> LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TFARM' (bio.tools/tfarm), 'MOTIVATION:Genome' | Association rule mining to identify transcription factor interactions in genomic regions | MOTIVATION:Genome regulatory networks have different layers and ways to modulate cellular processes, such as cell differentiation, proliferation and adaptation to external stimuli. Transcription factors and other chromatin associated proteins act as combinatorial protein complexes that control gene transcription. Thus, identifying functional interaction networks among these proteins is a fundamental task to understand the genome regulation framework. RESULTS:We developed a novel approach to infer interactions among transcription factors in user selected genomic regions, by combining the computation of association rules and of a novel Importance Index on ChIP-seq data sets",
