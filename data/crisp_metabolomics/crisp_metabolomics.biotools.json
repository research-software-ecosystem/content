Overall, CRISP demonstrates good potential as a DL-based approach for the rapid analysis of 4-D GC × GC-TOFMS untargeted metabolite profiles by directly implementing contour images. CRISP is available at https://github.com/vivekmathema/GCxGC-CRISP. Two-dimensional gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC-TOFMS) provides a large amount of molecular information from biological samples. However, the lack of a comprehensive compound library or customizable bioinformatics tool is currently a challenge in GC × GC-TOFMS data analysis. We present an open-source deep learning (DL) software called contour regions of interest (ROI) identification, simulation and untargeted metabolomics profiler (CRISP). CRISP integrates multiple customizable deep neural network architectures for assisting the semi-automated identification of ROIs, contour synthesis, resolution enhancement and classification of GC × GC-TOFMS-based contour images. The approach includes the novel aggregate feature representative contour (AFRC) construction and stacked ROIs. This generates an unbiased contour image dataset that enhances the contrasting characteristics between different test groups and can be suitable for small sample sizes. The utility of the generative models and the accuracy and efficacy of the platform were demonstrated using a dataset of GC × GC-TOFMS contour images from patients with late-stage diabetic nephropathy and healthy control groups. CRISP successfully constructed AFRC images and identified over five ROIs to create a deepstacked dataset. The high fidelity, 512 × 512-pixels generative model was trained as a generator with a FrCrossed D sign",
