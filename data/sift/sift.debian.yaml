description: "SIFT is a sequence homology-based tool that sorts intolerant from tolerant\
  \ amino acid substitutions and predicts whether an amino acid substitution in a\
  \ protein will have a phenotypic effect. SIFT is based on the premise that protein\
  \ evolution is correlated with protein function. Positions important for function\
  \ should be conserved in an alignment of the protein family, whereas unimportant\
  \ positions should appear diverse in an alignment.\n"
