description: SIFT is a sequence homology-based tool that sorts intolerant from tolerant
  amino acid substitutions and predicts whether an amino acid substitution in a protein
  will have a phenotypic effect. SIFT is based on the premise that protein evolution
  is correlated with protein function. Positions important for function should be
  conserved in an alignment of the protein family, whereas unimportant positions should
  appear diverse in an alignment.
