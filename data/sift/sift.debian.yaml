  description: predicts if a substitution in a protein has a phenotypic effect
  long_description: " SIFT is a sequence homology-based tool that sorts intolerant
    from tolerant\n amino acid substitutions and predicts whether an amino acid substitution\n
    in a protein will have a phenotypic effect. SIFT is based on the premise\n that
    protein evolution is correlated with protein function. Positions\n important for
    function should be conserved in an alignment of the protein\n family, whereas
    unimportant positions should appear diverse in an alignment.\n"
