The parameters influencing laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as a tool for imaging elemental distribution in tissues are critically commented on in this work, and penile cancer tissue was used as a model. General aspects of LA-ICP-MS are discussed, and among them, issues regarding sample preparation and calibration. The optimization process of the following variables is described in detail in a step-by-step tutorial manner: laser intensity, laser frequency, laser resolution, ICP radiofrequency, nebulizer and auxiliary gas flow rates, and C isotopes as internal standards. Once the best condition is found for each variable, MATLAB software is used to generate two-dimensional images. Herein it is also explained how to use MATLAB software to generate tissue images using acquisition, exporting and data treatment parameters.","authors":["Pessoa G.D.S.","Capelo-Martinez J.L.","Fdez-Riverola F.","Lopez-Fernandez H.","Glez-Pena D.","Reboiro-Jato M.","Arruda M.A.Z."],"cit_count":12,"doi":"10.1039/C5JA00451A","journal":"Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry","title":"Laser ablation and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry focusing on bioimaging from elemental distribution using MatLab software: A practical guide","type":"Primary","year":"2016-04-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:la-images","biotoolsID":"la-images","description":"Open source application to generate 2D/3D bioimages of the elemental distribution of the elements present in a set from ICP-MS spectra.","homepage":"http://www.la-images.net","name":"LA-iMageS","version":["1.1.3"]}}
