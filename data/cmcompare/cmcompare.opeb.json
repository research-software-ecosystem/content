            "abstract": "A standard method for the identification of novel non-coding RNAs is homology search by covariance models. Covariance models are constructed for specific RNA families with common sequence and structure (e.g. transfer RNAs). Currently, there are models for 2208 families available from Rfam. Before being included into a database, a proposed family should be tested for specificity (finding only true homolog sequences), sensitivity (finding remote homologs) and uniqueness. The CMCompare webserver (CMCws) compares Infernal RNA family models to (i) identify models with poor specificity and (ii) explore the relationship between models. The CMCws provides options to compare new models against all existing models in the current Rfam database to avoid the construction of duplicate models for the same non-coding RNA family. In addition, the user can explore the relationship between two or more models, including whole sets of user-created family models. Visualization of family relationships provides help in evaluating candidates for clusters of biologically related families, called clans. The CMCws is freely available, without any login requirements, at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cmcws, and the underlying software is available under the GPL-3 license.",
