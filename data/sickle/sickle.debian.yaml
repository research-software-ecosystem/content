description: 'Most modern sequencing technologies produce reads that have deteriorating
  quality towards the 3''-end. Incorrectly called bases here negatively impact assembles,
  mapping, and downstream bioinformatics analyses. . Sickle is a tool that uses sliding
  windows along with quality and length thresholds to determine when quality is sufficiently
  low to trim the 3''-end of reads. It will also discard reads based upon the length
  threshold. It takes the quality values and slides a window across them whose length
  is 0.1 times the length of the read. If this length is less than 1, then the window
  is set to be equal to the length of the read. Otherwise, the window slides along
  the quality values until the average quality in the window drops below the threshold.
  At that point the algorithm determines where in the window the drop occurs and cuts
  both the read and quality strings there. However, if the cut point is less than
  the minimum length threshold, then the read is discarded entirely. . Sickle supports
  four types of quality values: Illumina, Solexa, Phred, and Sanger. Note that the
  Solexa quality setting is an approximation (the actual conversion is a non-linear
  transformation). The end approximation is close. . Sickle also supports gzipped
  file inputs.'
