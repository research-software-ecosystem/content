    "description": "JUCHMME, an acronym for Java Utility for Class Hidden Markov Models and Extensions is a tool developed for biological sequence analysis. The JUCHMME framework is ease of use and customization for various biological problems without requiring programming capabilities (settings will be made through a configuration file). It offers a large collection of training algorithms for HMM for labeled sequences. It integrates a wide range of decoding algorithms such as Viterbi, N\u2013Best, posterior\u2013Viterbi and Optimal Accuracy Posterior Decoder. It contains built-in evaluation procedures, such as options for independent test (self-consistency, jacknife, k\u2013fold cross-validation). All the prediction algorithms also incorporate the corresponding reliability measures. To overcome HMM limitations, a number of extensions have been developed such as Hidden Neural Networks, models that condition on previous observations and a method for semi-supervised learning.",

We incorporate a large collection of standard algorithms for HMMs as well as a number of extensions and evaluate the software on various biological problems. Importantly, the JUCHMME toolkit includes several additional features that allow for easy building and evaluation of custom HMMs, which could be a useful resource for the research community.",
