      "sc:description": "JUCHMME, an acronym for Java Utility for Class Hidden Markov Models and Extensions is a tool developed for biological sequence analysis. The JUCHMME framework is ease of use and customization for various biological problems without requiring programming capabilities (settings will be made through a configuration file). It offers a large collection of training algorithms for HMM for labeled sequences. It integrates a wide range of decoding algorithms such as Viterbi, N–Best, posterior–Viterbi and Optimal Accuracy Posterior Decoder. It contains built-in evaluation procedures, such as options for independent test (self-consistency, jacknife, k–fold cross-validation). All the prediction algorithms also incorporate the corresponding reliability measures. To overcome HMM limitations, a number of extensions have been developed such as Hidden Neural Networks, models that condition on previous observations and a method for semi-supervised learning.",
