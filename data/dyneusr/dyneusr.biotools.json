TDA techniques like Mapper have been recently applied to examine the brain\u2019s dynamical organization during ongoing cognition without averaging data in space, in time, or across participants at the outset. Such TDA-based approaches mark an important deviation from standard neuroimaging analyses by distilling complex high-dimensional neuroimaging data into simple\u2014yet neurophysiologically valid and behaviorally relevant\u2014representations that can be interactively explored at the single-participant level. To facilitate wider use of such techniques within neuroimaging and general neuroscience communities, our work provides several tools for visualizing, interacting with, and grounding TDA-generated graphical representations in neurophysiology. Through Python-based Jupyter notebooks and open datasets, we provide a platform to assess and visualize different intermittent stages of Mapper and examine the influence of Mapper parameters on the generated representations. We hope this platform could enable researchers and clinicians alike to explore topological representations of neuroimaging data and generate biological insights underlying complex mental disorders.",
