Biophysical modeling of TTField application has demonstrated a heterogeneous electric field distribution within the intracranial space, reaching maximal intensities at tissue borders with different electric conductivity. However, no imaging modality is available to visualize the impact of TTField treatment within the tumor and the bordering normal brain in each individual patient",
