  "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Improved control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) requires an additional advanced concept for public health | A major consequence of all elements of the 'epidemiological transition' is the rapid emergence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in low- and middle-income countries. In contrast to the outcomes of the 'Alma Ata Conference for Primary Health Care', it has not yet been possible to introduce an equally powerful health policy for the prevention and control of NCDs. Major strategies so far are to advise individuals not to smoke and drink alcohol in excess. Additionally, 'healthy' nutrition and increased physical activity are also advocated. Policy for preventing and working against NCDs is now part of the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically target 3.4. So far, attempts to soften the influence of NCDs on the health of the people in low- and middle-income countries have been unsuccessful",
