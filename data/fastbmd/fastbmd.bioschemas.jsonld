      "sc:description": "FastBMD is an online tool for rapid benchmark dose-response analysis of transcriptomics data. FastBMD is a computationally efficient implementation of the National Toxicology Program Approach to Genomic Dose-Response Modeling. Key features include a simplified workflow, ability to download results at each step, and interactive exploration of pathway-level BMDs. In addition to model organisms, FastBMD is designed to support non-model organisms by enabling an annotation-free pipeline that includes feature sensitivity-based point-of-departure analysis. The final part of the analysis is designed to allow users to interactively explore BMDs at different levels of organization:.",
