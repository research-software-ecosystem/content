    "description": "DomainParser uses a new algorithm for the decomposition of a multi-domain protein into individual structural domains. The underlying principle used is that residue-residue contacts are denser within a domain than between domains. We have formulated the domain decomposition problem as a network flow problem, in which each residue is represented as a node of a network and each residue-residue contact is represented as an edge with a particular capacity, depending on the type of the contact.",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Automatic decomposition of a multi-domain protein into individual domains represents a highly interesting and unsolved problem. As the number of protein structures in PDB is growing at an exponential rate, there is clearly a need for more reliable and efficient methods for protein domain decomposition simply to keep the domain databases up-to-date. Results: We present a new algorithm for solving the domain decomposition problem, using a graph-theoretic approach. We have formulated the problem as a network flow problem, in which each residue of a protein is represented as a node of the network and each residue-residue contact is represented as an edge with a particular capacity, depending on the type of the contact. A two-domain decomposition problem is solved by finding a bottleneck (or a minimum cut) of the network, which minimizes the total cross-edge capacity, using the classical Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. A multi-domain decomposition problem is solved through repeatedly solving a series of two-domain problems. The algorithm has been implemented as a computer program, called DomainParser. We have tested the program on a commonly used test set consisting of 55 proteins. The decomposition results are 78.2% in agreement with the literature on both the number of decomposed domains and the assignments of residues to each domain, which compares favorably to existing programs. On the subset of two-domain proteins (20 in number), the program assigned 96.7% of the residues correctly when we require that the number of decomposed domains is two.",
