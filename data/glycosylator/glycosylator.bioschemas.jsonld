      "sc:description": "a Python framework for the rapid modeling of glycans.\n\nFramework for the rapid modeling glycans and glycoproteins.\n\nGlycosylator is a Python framework for the identification, modeling and modification of glycans in protein structure. It can be used directly in a Python script through its API or through its Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI provides a straightforward 2D rendering of a glycoprotein that allows for a quick visual inspection of the gylcosylation state of all the sequons on a protein structure. Modeled glycans can be further refined by a genetic algorithm for removing clashes and sampling alternative conformations. Glycosylator can also identify specific 3D glycans on a protein structure using a library of predefined templates. Glycosylator has been implemented in a generic way allowing the user to expand the library to incorporate other polymers",
