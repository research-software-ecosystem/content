    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | an associated gene prioritization strategy and its application in drug repurposing for the treatment of canine epilepsy | Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder that affects mammalian species including human beings and dogs. In order to discover novel drugs for the treatment of canine epilepsy, multiomics data were analyzed to identify epilepsy associated genes. In this research, the original ranking of associated genes was obtained by two high-throughput bioinformatics experiments: Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) and microarray analysis. The association ranking of genes was enhanced by a re-ranking system, HPO-Shuffle, which integrated information from GWAS, microarray analysis and Human Phenotype Ontology database for further downstream analysis. After applying HPO-Shuffle, the association ranking of epilepsy genes were improved",
