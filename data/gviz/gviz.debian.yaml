summary: Plotting data and annotation information along genomic coordinates
description: >
   Genomic data analyses requires integrated visualization of known
   genomic information and new experimental data. Gviz uses the biomaRt and
   the rtracklayer packages to perform live annotation queries to Ensembl
   and UCSC and translates this to e.g. gene/transcript structures in
   viewports of the grid graphics package. This results in genomic
   information plotted together with your data.
