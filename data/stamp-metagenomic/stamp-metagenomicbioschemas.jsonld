  "sc:description": "A software package for analyzing metagenomic profiles (e.g., a taxonomic profile indicating the number of marker genes assigned to different taxonomic units or a functional profile indicating the number of sequences assigned to different biological subsystems or pathways) that promotes ‘best practices’ in choosing appropriate statistical techniques and reporting results. It encourages the use of effect sizes and confidence intervals in assessing biological importance.",
