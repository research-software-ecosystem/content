Their hydrophilic side prevents them from having the solubility and aggregation problems of conventional antibodies, and they retain the similar size and affinity of the binding area to the antigen. Nanobodies have become of considerable interest for next-generation biotechnological tools for antigen recognition. They can be easily engineered due to their high stability and compact size. They have three complementarity determining regions, CDRs, which are enlarged to provide a similar binding surface to that of regular antibodies. The binding residues are more exposed to the environment.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Nanobodies', 'CDRs', 'nanobodies.1', '2VYR'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/820373","name":"ModiBodies"}}
