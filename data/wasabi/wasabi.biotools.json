All rights reserved.Wasabi is an open source, web-based environment for evolutionary sequence analysis. Wasabi visualizes sequence data together with a phylogenetic tree within a modern, user-friendly interface: The interface hides extraneous options, supports context sensitive menus, drag- And-drop editing, and displays additional information, such as ancestral sequences, associated with specific tree nodes. The Wasabi environment supports reproducibility by automatically storing intermediate analysis steps and includes built-in functions to share data between users and publish analysis results. For computational analysis, Wasabi supports PRANK and PAGAN for phylogeny- Aware alignment and alignment extension, and it can be easily extended with other tools. Along with drag- And-drop import of local files,Wasabi can access remote data through URL and import sequence data, GeneTrees and EPO alignments directly from Ensembl. To demonstrate a typical workflow using Wasabi, we reproduce key findings from recent comparative genomics studies, including a reanalysis of the EGLN1 gene from the tiger genome study: These case studies can be browsed within Wasabi at http://wasabiapp.org:8000?id=usecases. Wasabi runs inside a web browser and does not require any installation. One can start using it at http://wasabiapp.org. All source code is licensed under the AGPLv3.",
