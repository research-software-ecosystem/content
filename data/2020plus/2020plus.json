Numerous methods have been developed to identify driver genes, but evaluation of the performance of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard, that is, bona fide driver gene mutations. Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied to driver gene prediction methods. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight such methods. One of these methods, described here, incorporated a machinelearning- based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of the eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the P values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false-positive driver gene predictions. Our analysis points to the strengths and weaknesses of each of the currently available methods and offers guidance for improving them in the future.", "citationCount": 48, "authors": [{"name": "Tokheim C.J."}, {"name": "Papadopoulos N."}, {"name": "Kinzler K.W."}, {"name": "Vogelstein B."}, {"name": "Karchin R."}], "date": "2016-12-13T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Collin Tokheim", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1395-5378", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ctokhei1@alumni.jh.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:2020plus", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["v1.2.2"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/KarchinLab/2020plus", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Variant pattern analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3504"}, {"term": "Variant classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3225"}, {"term": "Protein interaction network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0276"}, {"term": "Gene prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2454"}, {"term": "Expression profile clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0313"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-13T15:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "2020plus classifies genes as an oncogene, tumor suppressor gene, or as a non-driver gene from small somatic variants by using Random Forests.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Workflow"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "2020plus", "additionDate": "2019-02-08T15:35:19Z", "name": "2020plus", "license": "Apache-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://2020plus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
