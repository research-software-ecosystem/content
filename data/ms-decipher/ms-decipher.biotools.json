For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: The interpretation of mass spectrometry (MS) data is a crucial step in proteomics analysis, and the identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is vital for the understanding of the regulation mechanism of the living system. Among various PTMs, glycosylation is one of the most diverse ones. Though many search engines have been developed to decipher proteomic data, some of them are difficult to operate and have poor performance on glycoproteomic datasets compared to advanced glycoproteomic software. Results: To simplify the analysis of proteomic datasets, especially O-glycoproteomic datasets, here, we present a user-friendly proteomic database search platform, MS-Decipher, for the identification of peptides from MS data. Two scoring schemes can be chosen for peptide-spectra matching. It was found that MS-Decipher had the same sensitivity and confidence in peptide identification compared to traditional database searching software. In addition, a special search mode, O-Search, is integrated into MS-Decipher to identify O-glycopeptides for O-glycoproteomic analysis. Compared with Mascot, MetaMorpheus and MSFragger, MS-Decipher can obtain about 139.9%, 48.8% and 6.9% more O-glycopeptide-spectrum matches. A useful tool is provided in MS-Decipher for the visualization of O-glycopeptide-spectra matches. MS-Decipher has a user-friendly graphical user interface, making it easier to operate. Several file formats are available in the searching and validation steps. MS-Decipher is implemented with Java, and can be used cross-platform.",
