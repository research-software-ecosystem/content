  "sc:description": "IMGT®, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system® is the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics, created in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Université de Montpellier and CNRS). IMGT® is a high-quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH) of human and other vertebrate species, and in the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), MH superfamily (MhSF) and related proteins of the immune system (RPI) of vertebrates and invertebrates. IMGT® provides a common access to sequence, genome and structure Immunogenetics data, based on the concepts of IMGT-ONTOLOGY and on the IMGT Scientific chart rules. IMGT® works in close collaboration with EBI (Europe), DDBJ (Japan) and NCBI (USA). IMGT® consists of sequence databases, genome database, structure database, and monoclonal antibodies database, Web resources and interactive tools.",
