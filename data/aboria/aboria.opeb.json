The particles in such methods can represent actual particles (e.g. Molecular Dynamics) or abstract particles used to discretise a continuous function over a domain (e.g. Radial Basis Functions). Aboria provides a particle container, compatible with the Standard Template Library, spatial search data structures, and a Domain Specific Language to specify non-linear operators on the particle set. This paper gives an overview of Aboria's design, an example of use, and a performance benchmark.","authors":["Robinson M.","Bruna M."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2017.07.002","journal":"SoftwareX","title":"Particle-based and meshless methods with Aboria","type":"Primary","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:aboria","biotoolsID":"aboria","description":"Aboria is a powerful and flexible C++ library for the implementation of particle-based numerical methods.
