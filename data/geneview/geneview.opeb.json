The plethora of knowledge remains hidden in large text repositories like MEDLINE. Consequently, life scientists have to spend a great amount of time searching for specific information. The enormous ambiguity among most names of biomedical objects such as genes, chemicals and diseases often produces too large and unspecific search results. We present GeneView, a semantic search engine for biomedical knowledge. GeneView is built upon a comprehensively annotated version of PubMed abstracts and openly available PubMed Central full texts. This semi-structured representation of biomedical texts enables a number of features extending classical search engines. For instance, users may search for entities using unique database identifiers or they may rank documents by the number of specific mentions they contain. Annotation is performed by a multitude of state-of-the-art text-mining tools for recognizing mentions from 10 entity classes and for identifying protein-protein interactions. GeneView currently contains annotations for >194 million entities from 10 classes for ∼21 million citations with 271000 full text bodies. GeneView can be searched at http://bc3.informatik.hu-berlin.de/. © 2012 The Author(s).","authors":["Thomas P.","Starlinger J.","Vowinkel A.","Arzt S.","Leser U."],"cit_count":40,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22693219","title":"GeneView: A comprehensive semantic search engine for PubMed","year":"2012-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:geneview","biotoolsID":"geneview","description":"Webserver that lets you search scientific articles using keywords and identifiers for specific biological entities.
