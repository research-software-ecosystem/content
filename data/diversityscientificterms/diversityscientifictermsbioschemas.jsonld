      "sc:description": "DiversityScientificTerms (DWB-DST) is an application of Diversity Workbench (DWB). It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. Each DWB module is devoted to a specific data domain. DST is focussed on the management of collections of scientific terms and term concepts, i. e., particular domain-specific  terminologies, glossaries and vocabularies (e.g. biostratigraphy, anatomical terminology). DST is able to organise terms together with synonyms, common names and equivalent  terms Ã­n different languages. The single terms are defined, (hierarchically) classified and referenced, for example, by linking online resources and external identifiers.",
