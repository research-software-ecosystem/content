Jpred performs over 1000 predictions per week for users in more than 50 countries. The recently updated Jnet algorithm provides a three-state (alpha-helix, beta-strand and coil) prediction of secondary structure at an accuracy of 81.5%. Given either a single protein sequence or a multiple sequence alignment, Jpred derives alignment profiles from which predictions of secondary structure and solvent accessibility are made. The predictions are presented as coloured HTML, plain text, PostScript, PDF and via the Jalview alignment editor to allow flexibility in viewing and applying the data. The new Jpred 3 server includes significant usability improvements that include clearer feedback of the progress or failure of submitted requests. Functional improvements include batch submission of sequences, summary results via email and updates to the search databases. A new software pipeline will enable Jnet/Jpred to continue to be updated in sync with major updates to SCOP and UniProt and so ensures that Jpred 3 will maintain high-accuracy predictions.", "citationCount": 1140, "authors": [{"name": "Cole C."}, {"name": "Barber J.D."}, {"name": "Barton G.J."}], "date": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "www-jpred@compbio.dundee.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:jpred_3", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction (turns)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0469"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction (helices)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0468"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction (coils)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0470"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Improved web server for predicting protein secondary structure in three states (alpha helix, beta strand and coil).
