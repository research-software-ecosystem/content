However, one of the key bottlenecks preventing them from therapeutic peptides is their toxicity toward human cells, and few available algorithms for predicting toxicity are specially designed for short-length peptides. Results: We present ToxIBTL, a novel deep learning framework by utilizing the information bottleneck principle and transfer learning to predict the toxicity of peptides as well as proteins. Specifically, we use evolutionary information and physicochemical properties of peptide sequences and integrate the information bottleneck principle into a feature representation learning scheme, by which relevant information is retained and the redundant information is minimized in the obtained features. Moreover, transfer learning is introduced to transfer the common knowledge contained in proteins to peptides, which aims to improve the feature representation capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ToxIBTL not only achieves a higher prediction performance than state-of-the-art methods on the peptide dataset, but also has a competitive performance on the protein dataset. Furthermore, a user-friendly online web server is established as the implementation of the proposed ToxIBTL.",
