    "description": "Identifying and removing haplotypic duplication in primary genome assemblies | haplotypic duplication identification tool | scripts/pd_config.py: script to generate a configuration file used by run_purge_dups.py | purge haplotigs and overlaps in an assembly based on read depth | Given a primary assembly pri_asm and an alternative assembly hap_asm (optional, if you have one), follow the steps shown below to build your own purge_dups pipeline, steps with same number can be run simultaneously. Among all the steps, although step 4 is optional, we highly recommend our users to do so, because assemblers may produce overrepresented seqeuences. In such a case, The final step 4 can be applied to remove those seqeuences",
