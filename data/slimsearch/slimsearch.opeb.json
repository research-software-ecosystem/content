The SLiMSearch 2.0 (Short, Linear Motif Search) web server allows researchers to identify occurrences of a user-defined SLiM in a proteome, using conservation and protein disorder context statistics to rank occurrences. User-friendly output and visualizations of motif context allow the user to quickly gain insight into the validity of a putatively functional motif occurrence. For each motif occurrence, overlapping UniProt features and annotated SLiMs are displayed. Visualization also includes annotated multiple sequence alignments surrounding each occurrence, showing conservation and protein disorder statistics in addition to known and predicted SLiMs, protein domains and known post-translational modifications. In addition, enrichment of Gene Ontology terms and protein interaction partners are provided as indicators of possible motif function. All web server results are available for download. Users can search motifs against the human proteome or a subset thereof defined by Uniprot accession numbers or GO term. The SLiMSearch server is available at: http://bioware.ucd.ie/slimsearch2.html. © 2011 The Author(s).","authors":["Davey N.E.","Haslam N.J.","Shields D.C.","Edwards R.J."],"cit_count":50,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkr402","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21622654","title":"SLiMSearch 2.0: Biological context for short linear motifs in proteins","type":"Primary","version":"2","year":"2011-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:slimsearch","biotoolsID":"slimsearch","description":"Short Linear Motifs Search. Proteome-wide discovery and annotation of functional modules in intrinsically disordered regions.
