The toolkit incorporates over 130 functions, which are designed to meet the increasing demand for big-data analyses, ranging from bulk sequence processing to interactive data visualization. Its robustness has been validated by tens of thousands of users, making it a handy and useful toolkit for biologists. \u00a9 2020 The AuthorThe rapid development of high-throughput sequencing techniques has led biology into the big-data era. Data analyses using various bioinformatics tools rely on programming and command-line environments, which are challenging and time-consuming for most wet-lab biologists. Here, we present TBtools (a Toolkit for Biologists integrating various biological data-handling tools), a stand-alone software with a user-friendly interface. The toolkit incorporates over 130 functions, which are designed to meet the increasing demand for big-data analyses, ranging from bulk sequence processing to interactive data visualization. A wide variety of graphs can be prepared in TBtools using a new plotting engine (\u201cJIGplot\u201d) developed to maximize their interactive ability; this engine allows quick point-and-click modification of almost every graphic feature. TBtools is platform-independent software that can be run under all operating systems with Java Runtime Environment 1.6 or newer. It is freely available to non-commercial users at https://github.com/CJ-Chen/TBtools/releases.",
