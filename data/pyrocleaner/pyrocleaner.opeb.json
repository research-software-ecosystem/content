A recent reported bias leads to the production of multiple reads for a unique DNA fragment in a random manner within a run. This bias has a direct impact on the quality of the measurement of the representation of the fragments using the reads. Other cleaning steps are usually performed on the reads before assembly or alignment. Findings. PyroCleaner is a software module intended to clean 454 pyrosequencing reads in order to ease the assembly process. This program is a free software and is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation. It implements several filters using criteria such as read duplication, length, complexity, base-pair quality and number of undetermined bases. It also permits to clean flowgram files (.sff) of paired-end sequences generating on one hand validated paired-ends file and the other hand single read file. Conclusions: Read cleaning has always been an important step in sequence analysis. The pyrocleaner python module is a Swiss knife dedicated to 454 reads cleaning. It includes commonly used filters as well as specialised ones such as duplicated read removal and paired-end read verification. © 2011 Jérme et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Jerome M.","Noirot C.","Klopp C."],"cit_count":36,"doi":"10.1186/1756-0500-4-149","journal":"BMC Research Notes","title":"Assessment of replicate bias in 454 pyrosequencing and a multi-purpose read-filtering tool","type":"Primary","year":"2011-05-30"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pyrocleaner","biotoolsID":"pyrocleaner","description":"Intended to clean the reads included in the sff file in order to ease the assembly process.
