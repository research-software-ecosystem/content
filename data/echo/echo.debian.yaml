description: ECHO is an error correction algorithm designed for short-reads from next-generation
  sequencing platforms such as Illumina's Genome Analyzer II. The algorithm uses a
  Bayesian framework to improve the quality of the reads in a given data set by employing
  maximum a posteriori estimation.
