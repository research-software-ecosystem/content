Prior to any group analysis, dMRI data are generally processed to alleviate adverse effects of known artefacts such as signal drift, data noise and outliers, subject motion, and geometric distortions. These dMRI data processing steps are often combined in automated pipelines, such as the one of the Human Connectome Project (HCP). While improving the performance of processing tools has clearly shown its benefits at each individual step along the pipeline, it remains unclear whether and to what degree choices for specific user-defined parameter settings can affect the final outcome of group analyses",
