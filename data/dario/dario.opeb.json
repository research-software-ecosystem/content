Current methods for high-throughput sequencing for the first time offer the opportunity to investigate the entire ncRNAome in an essentially unbiased way. However, there is a substantial need for methods that allow a convenient analysis of these overwhelmingly large data sets. Here, we present DARIO, a free web service that allows to study short read data from small RNA-seq experiments. It provides a wide range of analysis features, including quality control, read normalization, ncRNA quantification and prediction of putative ncRNA candidates.
