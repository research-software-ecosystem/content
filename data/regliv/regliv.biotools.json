                "abstract": "© 2022 Elsevier LtdMultiomics is a powerful technique in molecular biology that facilitates the identification of new associations among different molecules (genes, proteins & metabolites). It has attracted tremendous research interest from the scientists worldwide and has led to an explosive number of published studies. Most of these studies are based on the regulation data provided in available databases. Therefore, it is essential to have molecular regulation data that are strictly validated in the living systems of various cell lines and in vivo models. However, no database has been developed yet to provide comprehensive molecular regulation information validated by living systems. Herein, a new database, Molecular Regulation Data of Living System Facilitating Multiomics Study (REGLIV) is introduced to describe various types of molecular regulation tested by the living systems. (1) A total of 2996 regulations describe the changes in 1109 metabolites triggered by alterations in 284 genes or proteins, and (2) 1179 regulations describe the variations in 926 proteins induced by 125 endogenous metabolites. Overall, REGLIV is unique in (a) providing the molecular regulation of a clearly defined regulatory direction other than simple correlation, (b) focusing on molecular regulations that are validated in a living system not simply in an in vitro test, and (c) describing the disease/tissue/species specific property underlying each regulation. Therefore, REGLIV has important implications for the future practice of not only multiomics, but also other fields relevant to molecular regulation.
