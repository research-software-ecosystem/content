Automatic detection of a suitable parallel environment is used such that scripts are portable between parallel and non-parallel environments with no modification of the script. Availability and implementation: Source code and binaries freely available (under GPL-3) for download via CRAN at http://cran.rproject. org/package=PCIT, implemented in R and supported on Linux and MS Windows.
