      "sc:description": "Automated brain extraction of multisequence MRI using artificial neural networks | Brain extraction is a critical preprocessing step in the analysis of neuroimaging studies conducted with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and influences the accuracy of downstream analyses. The majority of brain extraction algorithms are, however, optimized for processing healthy brains and thus frequently fail in the presence of pathologically altered brain or when applied to heterogeneous MRI datasets. Here we introduce a new, rigorously validated algorithm (termed HD-BET) relying on artificial neural networks that aim to overcome these limitations",
