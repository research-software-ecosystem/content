                "abstract": "Background: To aid in bioinformatics data processing and analysis, an increasing number of web-based applications are being deployed. Although this is a positive circumstance in general, the proliferation of tools makes it difficult to find the right tool, or more importantly, the right set of tools that can work together to solve real complex problems. Results: Magallanes (Magellan) is a versatile, platform-independent Java library of algorithms aimed at discovering bioinformatics web services and associated data types. A second important feature of Magallanes is its ability to connect available and compatible web services into workflows that can process data sequentially to reach a desired output given a particular input. Magallanes' capabilities can be exploited both as an API or directly accessed through a graphic user interface. Conclusion: The Magallanes' API is freely available for academic use, and together with Magallanes application has been tested in MS-Windows™ XP and Unix-like operating systems. Detailed implementation information, including user manuals and tutorials, is available at http://www.bitlab-es.com/magallanes. Different implementations of the same client (web page, desktop applications, web services, etc.) have been deployed and are currently in use in real installations such as the National Institute of Bioinformatics (Spain) and the ACGT-EU project. This shows the potential utility and versatility of the software library, including the integration of novel tools in the domain and with strong evidences in the line of facilitate the automatic discovering and composition of workflows. © 2009 Ríos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
