Single-cell analysis technologies are essential tools in research and clinical diagnostics. These methods include flow cytometry, mass cytometry, and other microfluidics-based technologies. Most laboratories that employ these methods maintain large repositories of antibodies. These ever-growing collections of antibodies, their multiple conjugates, and the large amounts of data generated in assays using specific antibodies and conditions makes a dedicated software solution necessary. We have developed AirLab, a cloud-based tool with web and mobile interfaces, for the organization of these data. AirLab streamlines the processes of antibody purchase, organization, and storage, antibody panel creation, results logging, and antibody validation data sharing and distribution. Furthermore, AirLab enables inventory of other laboratory stocks, such as primers or clinical samples, through user-controlled customization. Thus, AirLab is a mobile-powered and flexible tool that harnesses the capabilities of mobile tools and cloud-based technology to facilitate inventory and sharing of antibody and sample collections and associated validation data.","authors":["Catena R.","Ozcan A.","Jacobs A.","Chevrier S.","Bodenmiller B."],"cit_count":5,"doi":"10.1186/s13059-016-1006-0","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"AirLab: A cloud-based platform to manage and share antibody-based single-cell research","year":"2016-06-29"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:airlab","biotoolsID":"airlab","description":"Cloud-based platform to manage and share antibody-based single-cell research.","homepage":"http://www.airlaboratory.ch/#/","name":"AirLab"}}
