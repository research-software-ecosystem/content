First, we collected and compiled data sets from the literature used for developing bioinformatics methods to annotate the structure and function of proteins. Second, data sets were derived from the latest release of PDB using standard protocols. Third, we developed a powerful module for creating a wide range of customized data sets from the current release of PDB. This is a flexible module that allows users to create data sets using a simple six step procedure. In addition, a number of web services have been integrated in ccPDB, which include submission of jobs on PDB-based servers, annotation of protein structures and generation of patterns. This database maintains >30 types of data sets such as secondary structure, tight-turns, nucleotide interacting residues, metals interacting residues, DNA/RNA binding residues and so on. © The Author(s) 2011.","authors":["Singh H.","Chauhan J.S.","Gromiha M.M.","Raghava G.P.S."],"cit_count":19,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22139939","title":"ccPDB: Compilation and creation of data sets from Protein Data Bank","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ccpdb","biotoolsID":"ccpdb","description":"ccPDB (Compilation and Creation of datasets from PDB) is designed to provide service to scientific community working in the field of function or structure annoation of proteins.
