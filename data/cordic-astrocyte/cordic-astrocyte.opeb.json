The promise of the high speed, cost-effectiveness, and power efficiency in addition to parallel processing has made application-specific hardware an attractive simulation platform. This paper proposes high-speed and low-cost digital hardware to emulate a biological-plausible astrocyte and glutamate-release mechanism. The nonlinear terms of these models were calculated using a high-precision and cost-effective algorithm. Subsequently, the modified models were simulated to study and validate their functions.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'biological-plausible', 'FPGA', 'Glutamate-IP3-Ca2+', 'glutamate-release'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31751284","name":"CORDIC-Astrocyte"}}
