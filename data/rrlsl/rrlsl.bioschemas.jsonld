      "sc:description": "Prognostic outcome prediction by semi-supervised least squares classification.\n\nAlthough great progress has been made in prognostic outcome prediction, small sample size remains a challenge in obtaining accurate and robust classifiers. We proposed the Rescaled linear square Regression based Least Squares Learning (RRLSL), a jointly developed semi-supervised feature selection and classifier, for predicting prognostic outcome of cancer patients. RRLSL used the least square regression to identify the scale factors and then rank the features in available multiple types of molecular data. We applied the unlabeled multiple molecular data in conjunction with the labeled data to develop a similarity graph. RRLSL produced the constraint with kernel functions to bridge the gap between label information and geometry information from messenger RNA and microRNA expression profiling",
