VisCoSe is the only interface available that simultaneously calculates consensus sequences of multiple data sets and automatically compares these consensus sequences. Furthermore, VisCoSe allows visualization of chemical properties of amino acids. © Oxford University Press 2004; All rights reserved.","authors":["Spitzer M.","Fuellen G.","Cullen P.","Lorkowski S."],"cit_count":12,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"14960475","title":"VisCoSe: Visualization and comparison of consensus sequences","year":"2004-02-12"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:viscose","biotoolsID":"viscose","description":"Web based tool that takes a set of sequences (aligned or unaligned) and calculates a consensus sequence and the conservation rates for the sequence alignment, producing an easy to interpret visualization as output.
