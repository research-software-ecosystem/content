Here, we report a large-scale analysis to systematically predict and characterize proteins that cause drug side effects. We integrated phenotypic data obtained during clinical trials with known drug-target relations to identify overrepresented protein-side effect combinations. Using independent data, we confirm that most of these overrepresentations point to proteins which, when perturbed, cause side effects. Of 1428 side effects studied, 732 were predicted to be predominantly caused by individual proteins, at least 137 of them backed by existing pharmacological or phenotypic data. We prove this concept in vivo by confirming our prediction that activation of the serotonin 7 receptor (HTR7) is responsible for hyperesthesia in mice, which, in turn, can be prevented by a drug that selectively inhibits HTR7. Taken together, we show that a large fraction of complex drug side effects are mediated by individual proteins and create a reference for such relations.","authors":["Kuhn M.","Al Banchaabouchi M.","Campillos M.","Jensen L.J.","Gross C.","Gavin A.-C.","Bork P."],"cit_count":70,"journal":"Molecular Systems Biology","pmid":"23632385","title":"Systematic identification of proteins that elicit drug side effects","year":"2013-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sider","biotoolsID":"sider","description":"Contains information on marketed medicines and their recorded adverse drug reactions.
