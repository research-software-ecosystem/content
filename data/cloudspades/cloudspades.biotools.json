Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: The recently developed barcoding-based synthetic long read (SLR) technologies have already found many applications in genome assembly and analysis. However, although some new barcoding protocols are emerging and the range of SLR applications is being expanded, the existing SLR assemblers are optimized for a narrow range of parameters and are not easily extendable to new barcoding technologies and new applications such as metagenomics or hybrid assembly. Results: We describe the algorithmic challenge of the SLR assembly and present a cloudSPAdes algorithm for SLR assembly that is based on analyzing the de Bruijn graph of SLRs. We benchmarked cloudSPAdes across various barcoding technologies/applications and demonstrated that it improves on the state-of-the-art SLR assemblers in accuracy and speed.",
