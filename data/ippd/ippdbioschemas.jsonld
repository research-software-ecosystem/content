  "sc:description": "The package provides functionality to extract isotopic peak patterns from raw mass spectra. This is done by fitting a large set of template basis functions to the raw spectrum using either nonnegative least squares or least absolute deviation fittting. The package offers a flexible function which tries to estimate model parameters in a way tailored to the peak shapes in the data. The package also provides functionality to process LCMS runs.",
