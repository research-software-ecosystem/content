description: The package provides functionality to extract isotopic peak patterns
  from raw mass spectra. This is done by fitting a large set of template basis functions
  to the raw spectrum using either nonnegative least squares or least absolute deviation
  fittting. The package offers a flexible function which tries to estimate model parameters
  in a way tailored to the peak shapes in the data. The package also provides functionality
  to process LCMS runs.
