    "description": "Hipathia is a method for the computation of signal transduction along signaling pathways from transcriptomic data. The method is based on an iterative algorithm which is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a network by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and the intensity of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a new approach to functional analysis allowing to compute the signal arriving to the functions annotated to each pathway.",

                "abstract": "Understanding the aspects of the cell functionality that account for disease or drug action mechanisms is a main challenge for precision medicine. Here we propose a new method that models cell signaling using biological knowledge on signal transduction. The method recodes individual gene expression values (and/or gene mutations) into accurate measurements of changes in the activity of signaling circuits, which ultimately constitute high-throughput estimations of cell functionalities caused by gene activity within the pathway. Moreover, such estimations can be obtained either at cohort-level, in case/control comparisons, or personalized for individual patients. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated in an extensive analysis involving 5640 patients from 12 different cancer types. Circuit activity measurements not only have a high diagnostic value but also can be related to relevant disease outcomes such as survival, and can be used to assess therapeutic interventions.",
