The method is based on an iterative algorithm which is able to compute the signal intensity passing through the nodes of a network by taking into account the level of expression of each gene and the intensity of the signal arriving to it. It also provides a new approach to functional analysis allowing to compute the signal arriving to the functions annotated to each pathway.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/hipathia.html","name":"hipathia","version":["1.0.0"]}}
