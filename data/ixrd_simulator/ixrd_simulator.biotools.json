                "abstract": "An open source Python package named xrd_simulator, capable of simulating geometrical interactions between a monochromatic X-ray beam and a polycrystalline microstructure, is described and demonstrated. The software can simulate arbitrary intragranular lattice variations of single crystals embedded within a multiphase 3D aggregate by making use of a tetrahedral mesh representation where each element holds an independent lattice. By approximating the X-ray beam as an arbitrary convex polyhedral region in space and letting the sample be moved continuously through arbitrary rigid motions, data from standard and non-standard measurement sequences can be simulated. This implementation is made possible through analytical solutions to a modified, time-dependent version of the Laue equations. The software, which primarily targets three-dimensional X-ray diffraction microscopy (high-energy X-ray diffraction microscopy) type experiments, enables the numerical exploration of which sample quantities can and cannot be reconstructed for a given acquisition scheme. Similarly, xrd_simulator targets investigations of different measurement sequences in relation to optimizing both experimental run times and sampling.",
