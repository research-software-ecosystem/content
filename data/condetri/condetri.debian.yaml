  description: straight-forward trimming of FASTQ sequences
  long_description: " This package is a simplistic contribution to the wealth of tools\
    \ for\n trimming of sequences of current Next-Generation-Sequencing data. It\n\
    \ was developed in the context of de novo whole-genome assembly.\n .\n The tool\
    \ reads from the 3'-end and extract reads (or read pairs) of good\n quality. If\
    \ the reads are paired, the filtering is done pairwise, and\n if one read in a\
    \ pair has low quality, the remaining read is saved as\n single end."
