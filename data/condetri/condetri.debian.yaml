description: This package is a simplistic contribution to the wealth of tools for
  trimming of sequences of current Next-Generation-Sequencing data. It was developed
  in the context of de novo whole-genome assembly. . The tool reads from the 3'-end
  and extract reads (or read pairs) of good quality. If the reads are paired, the
  filtering is done pairwise, and if one read in a pair has low quality, the remaining
  read is saved as single end.
