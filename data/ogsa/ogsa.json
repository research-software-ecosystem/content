Deregulation can be driven by a number of molecular events, including gene mutation, epigenetic changes in gene promoters, overexpression, and gene amplifications or deletions. We demonstrate a novel approach that identifies pathways of interest by integrating outlier analysis within and across molecular data types with gene set analysis. We use the results to seed the top-scoring pair algorithm to identify robust biomarkers associated with pathway deregulation. We demonstrate this methodology on pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) data. We develop a biomarker in primary AML tumors, demonstrate robustness with an independent primary tumor data set, and show that the identified biomarkers also function well in relapsed pediatric AML tumors. \u00a9 2004-2012 IEEE.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Ochs M.F."}, {"name": "Farrar J.E."}, {"name": "Considine M."}, {"name": "Wei Y."}, {"name": "Meshinchi S."}, {"name": "Arceci R.J."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Michael F.
