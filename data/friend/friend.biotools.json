                "abstract": "Friend is a bioinformatics application designed for simultaneous analysis and visualization of multiple structures and sequences of proteins and/or DNA/RNA. The application provides basic functionalities, such as structure visualization, with different rendering and coloring, sequence alignment and simple phylogeny analysis, along with a number of extended features to perform more complex analyses of sequence structure relationships, including structural alignment of proteins, investigation of specific interaction motifs, studies of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and protein super-families. It is also useful for functional annotation of proteins, protein modeling and protein folding studies. Friend provides three levels of usage: (1) an extensive GUI for a scientist with no programming experience, (2) a command line interface for scripting for a scientist with some programming experience and (3) the ability to extend Friend with user written libraries for an experienced programmer. The application is linked and communicates with local and remote sequence and structure databases. \u00a9 The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.",
