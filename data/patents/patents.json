Anti-inflammatory drugs work wonder in all these conditions, where the patient has become refractory to standard treatment. However, available anti-inflammatory agents have side effects associated with chronic use, thus if we could develop safe and efficacious molecules, quality of health care provided will improve. Since plant sources have been extensively explored, the focus needs to be shifted on the alternative natural sources of anti-inflammatory agents. Water bodies especially the sea and ocean are under investigation to find agents which can tackle inflammation. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews anti-inflammatory agents obtained from five types of marine organisms namely microalgae, sea cucumber, mussels, sponges and corals. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed/Science Direct with keywords marine organisms, inflammation, marine sponges, sea cucumber, mussels, corals and microalgae. Patents were searched using the key terms inflammation, marine agents from www.google.com/patents, www.uspto.gov, http://espacenet.com, www.freepatentsonline.com, www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/searchsimp. jsp and www.freshpatents.com. RESULTS: Literature and current patents have revealed applications of anti-inflammatory agents from marine organisms in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals. These agents are used to treat inflammatory disorders ranging from minor allergy to chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. Marine waste is also a valuable resource for nutraceuticals and anti-inflammatory agents. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal that marine organisms could be a promising source of novel antiinflammatory agents. However, further investigations are suggested for the isolation and identification of bioactive, exploring the mechanism of action and evaluating the efficacy in various inflammatory conditions.",
