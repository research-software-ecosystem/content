Based on functional annotations (such as KEGG), it provides pathway maps for primary cellular metabolism as well as for some additional secondary metabolite synthesis and regulatory pathways. Users can map their own data onto these pathway maps. Due to its navigation and customization functions, it thus allows users to easily explore and analyze the functional and metabolic capabilities of their (meta-)genomic data sets.",
