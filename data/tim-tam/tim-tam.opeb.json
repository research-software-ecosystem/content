Here, we used thermodynamic and structure analyses to define a highly conserved sequence-structure in tat mRNA that functions as Tat IRES modulator of tat mRNA (TIM-TAM). By impeding cap-dependent ribosome progression during authentic spliced tat mRNA translation, TIM-TAM stable structure impacts on timing and level of Tat protein hence controlling HIV production and infectivity along with promoting latency.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Tat IRES modulator tat mRNA'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31875221","name":"TIM-TAM"}}
