Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research. ComplexContact (http://raptorx2.uchicago.edu/ComplexContact/) is a web server for sequence-based interfacial residue-residue contact prediction of a putative protein complex. Interfacial residue-residue contacts are critical for understanding how proteins form complex and interact at residue level. When receiving a pair of protein sequences, ComplexContact first searches for their sequence homologs and builds two paired multiple sequence alignments (MSA), then it applies co-evolution analysis and a CASP-winning deep learning (DL) method to predict interfacial contacts from paired MSAs and visualizes the prediction as an image. The DL method was originally developed for intra-protein contact prediction and performed the best in CASP12. Our large-scale experimental test further shows that ComplexContact greatly outperforms pure co-evolution methods for inter-protein contact prediction, regardless of the species.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Zeng H."}, {"name": "Wang S."}, {"name": "Zhou T."}, {"name": "Zhao F."}, {"name": "Li X."}, {"name": "Wu Q."}, {"name": "Xu J."}], "date": "2018-07-02T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://raptorx2.uchicago.edu/contact/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:complexcontact", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://raptorx2.uchicago.edu/ComplexContact/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Residue interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0272"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Deposition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3431"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predicts the interfacial contacts between two potentially interacting protein sequences (heterodimer only) using co-evolution and deep learning techniques.
