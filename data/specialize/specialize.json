Traditionally it has been difficult to develop new algorithms to identify these atypical peptides because of the lack of a large set of annotated spectra from which to learn the altered fragmentation pattern. Using SUMOylation as an example, we propose a novel approach to generate large MS/MS training data from modified peptides and derive an algorithm that learns properties of PTM-specific fragmentation from such training data. Benchmark tests on data sets of varying complexity show that our method is 80-300% more sensitive than current state-of-the-art approaches. The core concepts of our method are readily applicable to developing algorithms for the identifications of peptides with other complex PTMs. \u00a9 2014 American Chemical Society.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Wang J."}, {"name": "Anania V.G."}, {"name": "Knott J."}, {"name": "Rush J."}, {"name": "Lill J.R."}, {"name": "Bourne P.E."}, {"name": "Bandeira N."}], "date": "2014-03-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jiw006@ucsd.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:specialize", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/software-tools/specialize/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "PTM identification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3645"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:39:12Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A novel approach to enable the expedited development of new algorithms for any types of PTM (post-translational modifications) peptide fragmentation.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/specialize-1-0-identification-of-peptides-with-complex-ptm-from-tandem-mass-spectra.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "specialize", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:01:54Z", "name": "Specialize", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/software-tools/specialize/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
