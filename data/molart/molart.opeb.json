Provided a UniProt ID, MolArt downloads and displays sequence annotations, sequence-structure mapping and relevant structures. The sequence and structure views are interlinked, enabling sequence annotations being color overlaid over the mapped structures, thus providing an enhanced understanding and interpretation of the available molecular data. Availability and implementation: MolArt is released under the Apache 2 license and is available at https://github.com/davidhoksza/MolArt. The project web page https://davidhoksza.github.io/MolArt/ features examples and applications of the tool.","authors":["Hoksza D.","Gawron P.","Ostaszewski M.","Schneider R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty489","journal":"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)","title":"MolArt: a molecular structure annotation and visualization tool","type":"Primary","year":"2018-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:MolArt","biotoolsID":"MolArt","description":"MolArt (MOLeculAR structure annoTator) - molecular structure annotation and visualization tool.","homepage":"https://davidhoksza.github.io/MolArt/","name":"MolArt"}}
