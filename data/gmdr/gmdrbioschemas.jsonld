  "sc:description": "Nonparametric and genetic model-free alternative to linear or logistic regression for detecting and characterizing nonlinear interactions among discrete genetic and environmental attributes. Compared with the MDR method, this method permits adjustment for discrete and quantitative covariates and is applicable to both dichotomous and continuous phenotypes in different population-based study designs. It will increase the precision accuracy and help users draw a more meaningful conclusion.",
