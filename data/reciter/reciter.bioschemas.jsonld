      "sc:description": "ReCiter is a highly accurate system for guessing which publications in PubMed a given person has authored. ReCiter includes a Java application, a DynamoDB-hosted database, and a set of RESTful microservices which collectively allow institutions to maintain accurate and up-to-date author publication lists for thousands of people. This software is optimized for disambiguating authorship in PubMed and, optionally, Scopus. ReCiter accurately identifies articles, including those at previous affiliations, by a given person. It does this by leveraging institutionally maintained identity data (e.g., departments, relationships, email addresses, year of degree, etc.) With the more complete and efficient searches that result from combining these types of data, you can save time and your institution can be more productive. If you run ReCiter daily, you can ensure that the desired users are the first to learn when a new publication has appeared in PubMed.",
