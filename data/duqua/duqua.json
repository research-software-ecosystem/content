    "description": "An overview of a nation-wide, multi-level analysis of relationships between quality management systems and patient factors in 32 hospitals.\n\nOBJECTIVE:The Deepening our Understanding of Quality in Australia (DUQuA) project is a multisite, multilevel, cross-sectional study of 32 of the largest hospitals in Australia. This overview examines relationships between (i) organization-level quality management systems and department-level quality management strategies and (ii) patient-level measures (clinical treatment processes, patient-reported perceptions of care and clinical outcomes) within Australian hospitals. DESIGN:We examined hospital quality improvement structures, processes and outcomes, collecting data at organization, department and patient levels for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hip fracture and stroke.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Deepening our Understanding Quality Australia', 'department-level', 'patient-level', 'DUQuE'",
