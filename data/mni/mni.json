Investigators might also use the MNI algorithm to identify the gene mediators of a disease or the physiological state of cells and tissues. The MNI algorithm uses a training data set of hundreds of expression profiles to construct a statistical model of gene-regulatory networks in a cell or tissue. The model describes combinatorial influences of genes on one another. The algorithm then uses the model to filter the expression profile of a particular experimental treatment and thereby distinguish the molecular targets or mediators of the treatment response from hundreds of additional genes that also exhibit expression changes. It takes \u223c1 h per run, although run time is significantly affected by the size of the genome and data set.", "citationCount": 20, "authors": [{"name": "Xing H."}, {"name": "Gardner T.S."}], "date": "2007-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Protocols"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://dibernardo.tigem.it/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:mni", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://dibernardo.tigem.it/softwares/mode-of-action-by-network-inference-mni", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3439"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:46Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Algorithm to identify the gene targets of a drug treatment based on gene-expression data.
