In a typical use of the algorithm, a single expression profile, say obtained as a result of a treatment under study, is used as the test profile while a set of hundreds of expression profiles is used as the training set.",

Investigators might also use the MNI algorithm to identify the gene mediators of a disease or the physiological state of cells and tissues. The MNI algorithm uses a training data set of hundreds of expression profiles to construct a statistical model of gene-regulatory networks in a cell or tissue. The model describes combinatorial influences of genes on one another. The algorithm then uses the model to filter the expression profile of a particular experimental treatment and thereby distinguish the molecular targets or mediators of the treatment response from hundreds of additional genes that also exhibit expression changes. It takes \u223c1 h per run, although run time is significantly affected by the size of the genome and data set.",
