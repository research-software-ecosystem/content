  description: automated genome assembly improvement and variant detection tool
  long_description: " Pilon is a software tool which can be used to:\n  * Automatically
    improve draft assemblies\n  * Find variation among strains, including large event
    detection\n Pilon requires as input a FASTA file of the genome along with one
    or more\n BAM files of reads aligned to the input FASTA file. Pilon uses read\n\
    \ alignment analysis to identify inconsistencies between the input genome and\n\
    \ the evidence in the reads. It then attempts to make improvements to the\n input
    genome, including:\n  * Single base differences\n  * Small indels\n  * Larger
    indel or block substitution events\n  * Gap filling\n  * Identification of local
    misassemblies, including optional opening\n    of new gaps\n"
