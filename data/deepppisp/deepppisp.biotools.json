                "abstract": "© 2020 Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play important roles in many biological processes. Conventional biological experiments for identifying PPI sites are costly and time-consuming. Thus, many computational approaches have been proposed to predict PPI sites. Existing computational methods usually use local contextual features to predict PPI sites. Actually, global features of protein sequences are critical for PPI site prediction. Results: A new end-to-end deep learning framework, named DeepPPISP, through combining local contextual and global sequence features, is proposed for PPI site prediction. For local contextual features, we use a sliding window to capture features of neighbors of a target amino acid as in previous studies. For global sequence features, a text convolutional neural network is applied to extract features from the whole protein sequence. Then the local contextual and global sequence features are combined to predict PPI sites. By integrating local contextual and global sequence features, DeepPPISP achieves the state-of-the-art performance, which is better than the other competing methods. In order to investigate if global sequence features are helpful in our deep learning model, we remove or change some components in DeepPPISP. Detailed analyses show that global sequence features play important roles in DeepPPISP.",
