Current stage technology allows the acquisition of profiles for a moderate number of genes (50 to a few thousand), and this number continues to grow. The use of appropriate normalization algorithms for qPCR-based data is therefore a highly important aspect of the data preprocessing pipeline. Results: We present and evaluate two data-driven normalization methods that directly correct for technical variation and represent robust alternatives to standard housekeeping gene-based approaches. We evaluated the performance of these methods against a single gene housekeeping gene method and our results suggest that quantile normalization performs best. These methods are implemented in freely-available software as an R package qpcrNorm distributed through the Bioconductor project. Conclusion: The utility of the approaches that we describe can be demonstrated most clearly in situations where standard housekeeping genes are regulated by some experimental condition. For large qPCR-based data sets, our approaches represent robust, data-driven strategies for normalization. \u00a9 2009 Mar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 63, "authors": [{"name": "Mar J.C."}, {"name": "Kimura Y."}, {"name": "Schroder K."}, {"name": "Irvine K.M."}, {"name": "Hayashizaki Y."}, {"name": "Suzuki H."}, {"name": "Hume D."}, {"name": "Quackenbush J."}], "date": "2009-04-19T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jessica Mar", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jess@jimmy.harvard.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:qpcrnorm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.32.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qpcrNorm.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Standardisation and normalisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The package contains functions to perform normalization of high-throughput qPCR data.
