description: FastML is a bioinformatics tool for the reconstruction of ancestral sequences
  based on the phylogenetic relations between homologous sequences. FastML runs several
  algorithms that reconstruct the ancestral sequences with emphasis on an accurate
  reconstruction of both indels and characters. For character reconstruction the previously
  described FastML algorithms are used to efficiently infer the most likely ancestral
  sequences for each internal node of the tree. Both joint and the marginal reconstructions
  are provided. For indels reconstruction the sequences are first coded according
  to the indel events detected within the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and then
  a state-of-the-art likelihood model is used to reconstruct ancestral indels states.
  The results are the most probable sequences, together with posterior probabilities
  for each character and indel at each sequence position for each internal node of
  the tree. FastML is generic and is applicable for any type of molecular sequences
  (nucleotide, protein, or codon sequences).
