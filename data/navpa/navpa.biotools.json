    "description": "Navpa is non-software, deriving its name from nav pa', Klingon for paper town. Paper towns were fictional entities historically used to detect copyright violation of published works such as maps. Navpa itself does nothing, including in genomics. However, It can be used to test that services building on bio.tools can handle the special case of a tool with no inputs, outputs or operations.",
