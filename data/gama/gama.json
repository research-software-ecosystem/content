    "description": "Simulation of marine activities by coupling Geographical Information System and Agent Based Model.\n\nGAMA is a modeling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit agent-based simulations.\n\nGAMA has been developed with a very general approach and can be used for many application domains. Some additional plugins had been developed to fit with particular needs.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Simulation marine activities coupling Geographical Information System Agent Based Model', 'SIMARIS', 'Iroise', 'Brittany'",
