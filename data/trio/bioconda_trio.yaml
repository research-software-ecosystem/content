description: Testing SNPs and SNP interactions with a genotypic TDT. This package
  furthermore contains functions for computing pairwise values of LD measures and
  for identifying LD blocks, as well as functions for setting up matched case pseudo-control
  genotype data for case-parent trios in order to run trio logic regression, for imputing
  missing genotypes in trios, for simulating case-parent trios with disease risk dependent
  on SNP interaction, and for power and sample size calculation in trio data.
