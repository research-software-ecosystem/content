summary: European molecular biology open software suite
description: >
   EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed for
   the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
   automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows
   transparent retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive
   libraries are provided with the package, it is a platform to allow other
   scientists to develop and release software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS
   also integrates a range of currently available packages and tools for sequence
   analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS breaks the historical trend towards
   commercial software packages.
