A high-level representation of protein structure, the molecular surface, displays patterns of chemical and geometric features that fingerprint a protein’s modes of interactions with other biomolecules. We hypothesize that proteins participating in similar interactions may share common fingerprints, independent of their evolutionary history. Fingerprints may be difficult to grasp by visual analysis but could be learned from large-scale datasets. We present MaSIF (molecular surface interaction fingerprinting), a conceptual framework based on a geometric deep learning method to capture fingerprints that are important for specific biomolecular interactions. We showcase MaSIF with three prediction challenges: protein pocket-ligand prediction, protein–protein interaction site prediction and ultrafast scanning of protein surfaces for prediction of protein–protein complexes. We anticipate that our conceptual framework will lead to improvements in our understanding of protein function and design.","authors":["Gainza P.","Sverrisson F.","Monti F.","Rodola E.","Boscaini D.","Bronstein M.M.","Correia B.E."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1038/S41592-019-0666-6","journal":"Nature Methods","pmid":"31819266","title":"Deciphering interaction fingerprints from protein molecular surfaces using geometric deep learning","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:MaSIF","biotoolsID":"MaSIF","description":"Deciphering interaction fingerprints from protein molecular surfaces using geometric deep learning.\n\nMaSIF- Molecular surface interaction fingerprints.
