A high-level representation of protein structure, the molecular surface, displays patterns of chemical and geometric features that fingerprint a protein\u2019s modes of interactions with other biomolecules. We hypothesize that proteins participating in similar interactions may share common fingerprints, independent of their evolutionary history. Fingerprints may be difficult to grasp by visual analysis but could be learned from large-scale datasets. We present MaSIF (molecular surface interaction fingerprinting), a conceptual framework based on a geometric deep learning method to capture fingerprints that are important for specific biomolecular interactions. We showcase MaSIF with three prediction challenges: protein pocket-ligand prediction, protein\u2013protein interaction site prediction and ultrafast scanning of protein surfaces for prediction of protein\u2013protein complexes. We anticipate that our conceptual framework will lead to improvements in our understanding of protein function and design.",
