                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press.Organ fibrosis represents a vital health threat that substantially contributes to yearly mortality rates. While a considerable amount of research has been conducted on fibrosis, these reports have only focused on specific organs as affected within distinct disorders. Accordingly, results from such studies have been unable to provide a comprehensive understanding of the pathological processes involved. Here, we describe the development of FibROAD, an open-Access database that integrates evidence from fibrosis-Associated disorders as obtained from both the literature and multi-omics data. This resource will greatly assist both researchers and clinicians in the comprehension and treatment of this condition. FibROAD currently involves an assembly of 232 strong evidence-based fibrosis-related genes (FRGs) as garnered from 909 PubMed publications and contains lists of multi-omics data from > 4000 samples including RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq MeDIP-seq and MBD-seq as obtained from 17 different organs in 5 species. Results from integrative analyses as obtained using FibROAD have demonstrated that FRGs can be indicators for a wide range of organ fibrosis and reveal potential pro-fibrotic candidate genes for fibrosis research. In conclusion, FibROAD serves as a convenient platform where researchers can acquire integrated evidence and a more comprehensive understanding of fibrosis-related disorders.
