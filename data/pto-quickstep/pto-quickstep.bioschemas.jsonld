      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Fast and Efficient Method for Cloning Random Mutagenesis Libraries | QuickStep is a cloning method that allows seamless point integration of a DNA sequence at any position within a target plasmid using only Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and DpnI endonuclease. This efficient and cost-effective method consists of two steps: two parallel asymmetric PCRs, followed by a megaprimer-based whole-plasmid amplification. To further simplify the workflow, enhance the efficiency, and increase the uptake of QuickStep, we replaced the asymmetric PCRs with a conventional PCR that uses phosphorothioate (PTO) oligos to generate megaprimers with 3' overhangs. The ease and speed of PTO-QuickStep were demonstrated through (1) right-first-time cloning of a 1.8 kb gene fragment into a pET vector and (2) creating a random mutagenesis library for directed evolution",
