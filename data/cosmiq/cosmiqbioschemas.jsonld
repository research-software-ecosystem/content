  "sc:description": "Tool for the preprocessing of liquid/gas chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS/GCMS) data, focusing on metabolomics or lipidomics applications. To improve the detection of low abundant signals, it generates master maps of the mZ/RT space from all acquired runs before a peak detection algorithm is applied. The result is a more robust identification and quantification of low-intensity MS signals compared to conventional approaches where peak picking is performed in each LCMS/GCMS file separately.",
