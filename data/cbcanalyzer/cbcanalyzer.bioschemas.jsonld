  "sc:description": "CBCAnalyzer ( compensatory base change) is a custom written software toolbox consisting of three parts, CTTransform, CBCDetect, and CBCTree. CTTransform reads several CT-file formats (ct, RNAviz ct or Mac ct), and generates a so called “bracket-dot-bracket” format that typically is used as input for other tools such as RNAforester, RNAmovie or MARNA. The latter one creates a multiple alignment based on primary sequences and secondary structures that now can be used as input for CBCDetect.
