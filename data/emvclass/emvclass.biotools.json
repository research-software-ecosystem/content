                "abstract": "Current technology allows clinical laboratories to rapidly translate research discoveries from small patient cohorts into clinical genetic tests; therefore, a potentially large proportion of sequence variants identified in individuals with clinical features of a genetic disorder remain unpublished. Without a mechanism for clinical laboratories to share data, interpretation of sequence variants may be inconsistent. We describe here the two components of Emory Genetics Laboratory's (EGL) in-house developed data management system. The first is a highly curated variant database with a data structure designed to facilitate sharing of information about variants identified at EGL with curated databases. This system also tracks changes in variant classifications, creating a record of previous cases in need of updated reports when a classification is changed. The second component, EmVClass, is a Web-based interface that allows any user to view the inventory of variants classified at EGL. These software tools provide a solution to two pressing issues faced by clinical genetics laboratories: how to manage a large variant inventory with evolving variant classifications that need to be communicated to healthcare providers and how to make that inventory of variants freely available to the community. \u00a9 2013 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.",
