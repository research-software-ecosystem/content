Discovering the influence of genetic variations on the alternative splicing will improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of variants. Here, we developed a new approach, PredPSI-SVR to predict the impact of variants on exon skipping events by using the support vector regression. From the sequence of a particular exon and its flanking regions, 42 comprehensive features related to splicing events were extracted. By using a greedy feature selection algorithm, we found eight features contributing most to the prediction. The trained model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.570 in the 10-fold cross-validation based on the training data set provided by the \u201cvex-seq\u201d challenge of the 5th Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation. In the blind test also held by the challenge, our prediction ranked the 2nd with a PCC of 0.566 that demonstrates the robustness of our method. A further test indicated that the PredPSI-SVR is helpful in prioritizing deleterious synonymous mutations. The method is available on https://github.com/chenkenbio/PredPSI-SVR.",
