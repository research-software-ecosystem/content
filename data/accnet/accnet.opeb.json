Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. AcCNET (Accessory genome Constellation Network) is a Perl application that aims to compare accessory genomes of a large number of genomic units, both at qualitative and quantitative levels. Using the proteomes extracted from the analysed genomes, AcCNET creates a bipartite network compatible with standard network analysis platforms. AcCNET allows merging phylogenetic and functional information about the concerned genomes, thus improving the capability of current methods of network analysis. The AcCNET bipartite network opens a new perspective to explore the pangenome of bacterial species, focusing on the accessory genome behind the idiosyncrasy of a particular strain and/or population.","authors":["Lanza V.F.","Baquero F.","De La Cruz F.","Coque T.M."],"cit_count":9,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw601","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"AcCNET (Ac cessory Genome C onstellation Net work): Comparative genomics software for accessory genome analysis using bipartite networks","type":"Primary","year":"2017-01-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:AcCNET","biotoolsID":"AcCNET","description":"AcCNET (Accessory genome Constellation Network) - application that aims to compare accessory genomes of a large number of genomic units, both at qualitative and quantitative levels.","homepage":"https://github.com/valflanza/accnet","name":"AcCNET"}}
