It consists of ‘core’ Java and Ruby software providing a platform for data capture, which can be deeply customised using ‘definition packets’ consisting of XML documents (data schema and UI) and Beanshell scripts (automation). Definition packets can also be generated using an XML-based domain-specific language, making customisation easier. FAIMS Mobile includes features allowing rich and efficient data capture tailored to the needs of fieldwork. It also promotes synthetic research and improves transparency and reproducibility through the production of comprehensive datasets that can be mapped to vocabularies or ontologies as they are created.","authors":["Ballsun-Stanton B.","Ross S.A.","Sobotkova A.","Crook P."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2017.12.006","journal":"SoftwareX","title":"FAIMS Mobile: Flexible, open-source software for field research","type":"Primary","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:faims_mobile","biotoolsID":"faims_mobile","description":"FAIMS is a native Android application that can be used for data capture when doing field work.","homepage":"https://github.com/ElsevierSoftwareX/SOFTX-D-17-00021","name":"FAIMS"}}
