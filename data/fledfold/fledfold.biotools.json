Method: In this paper, fledFold, a novel software for RNA secondary structure prediction, is introduced. It combines both thermodynamic and kinetic factors of RNA secondary structures and can predict RNA secondary structures from their primary sequences with local personal computers. Results: FledFold is implemented in C++ under Windows 7 and could run on windows 7 or later version with at least 2 GB of RAM. Fledfold is user friendly and could output results with multiple formats. Conslusion: FledFold will be a valuable tool for RNA researches and it could be downloaded freely from http://www.jlucomputer.com/fledfold.php.",
