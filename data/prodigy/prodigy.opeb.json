An important aspect of this is the ability to accurately predict the binding strength for a given protein-protein complex. Here we present PROtein binDIng enerGY prediction (PRODIGY), a web server to predict the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes from their 3D structure. The PRODIGY server implements our simple but highly effective predictive model based on intermolecular contacts and properties derived from non-interface surface.","authors":["Xue L.C.","Rodrigues J.P.","Kastritis P.L.","Bonvin A.M.","Vangone A."],"cit_count":59,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btw514","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"PRODIGY: A web server for predicting the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes","type":"Primary","year":"2016-01-01"},{"doi":"10.21769/BioProtoc.2124","type":"Usage"},{"doi":"10.7554/eLife.07454.001","pmcid":"PMC4523921","type":"Method"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:prodigy","biotoolsID":"prodigy","description":"Predict the binding affinity in protein-protein complexes.","homepage":"http://milou.science.uu.nl/services/PRODIGY/","name":"PRODIGY"}}
