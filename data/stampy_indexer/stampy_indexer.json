In many workflows, each of the short sequences (\"reads\") resulting from a sequencing run are first \"mapped\" (aligned) to a reference sequence to infer the read from which the genomic location derived, a challenging task because of the high data volumes and often large genomes. Existing read mapping software excel in either speed (e.g., BWA, Bowtie, ELAND) or sensitivity (e.g., Novoalign), but not in both. In addition, performance often deteriorates in the presence of sequence variation, particularly so for short insertions and deletions (indels). Here, we present a read mapper, Stampy, which uses a hybrid mapping algorithm and a detailed statistical model to achieve both speed and sensitivity, particularly when reads include sequence variation. This results in a higher useable sequence yield and improved accuracy compared to that of existing software. \u00a9 2011 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.", "citationCount": 551, "authors": [{"name": "Lunter G."}, {"name": "Goodson M."}], "date": "2011-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Research"}}, {"doi": "10.1093/nar/gkw343", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update", "abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.", "citationCount": 522, "authors": [{"name": "Afgan E."}, {"name": "Baker D."}, {"name": "van den Beek M."}, {"name": "Blankenberg D."}, {"name": "Bouvier D."}, {"name": "Cech M."}, {"name": "Chilton J."}, {"name": "Clements D."}, {"name": "Coraor N."}, {"name": "Eberhard C."}, {"name": "Gruning B."}, {"name": "Guerler A."}, {"name": "Hillman-Jackson J."}, {"name": "Von Kuster G."}, {"name": "Rasche E."}, {"name": "Soranzo N."}, {"name": "Turaga N."}, {"name": "Taylor J."}, {"name": "Nekrutenko A."}, {"name": "Goecks J."}], "date": "2016-07-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}, {"doi": "10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1", "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": null, "metadata": null}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Galaxy Support Team", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "galaxy@pasteur.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:stampy_indexer-ip", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.0.20"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/tool_runner?tool_id=toolshed.pasteur.fr/repos/fmareuil/stampy_mapper/stampy_indexer/1.0.20", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0863"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Genome indexing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3211"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Data", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0006"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-02-20T08:24:24Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Stampy genome indexer for divergent genomes.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://galaxy.pasteur.fr/tool_runner?tool_id=toolshed.pasteur.fr/repos/fmareuil/stampy_mapper/stampy_indexer/1.0.20", "note": null, "type": "Galaxy service"}], "biotoolsID": "stampy_indexer", "additionDate": "2016-12-19T14:23:07Z", "name": "stampy_indexer", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gerton/README.txt", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
