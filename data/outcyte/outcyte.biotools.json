                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).The prediction of protein localization, such as in the extracellular space, from high-throughput data is essential for functional downstream inference. It is well accepted that some secreted proteins go through the classic endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi pathway with the guidance of a signal peptide. However, a large number of proteins have been found to reach the extracellular space by following unconventional secretory pathways. There remains a demand for reliable prediction of unconventional protein secretion (UPS). Here, we present OutCyte, a fast and accurate tool for the prediction of UPS, which for the first time has been built upon experimentally determined UPS proteins. OutCyte mediates the prediction of protein secretion in two steps: first, proteins with N-terminal signals are accurately filtered out; second, proteins without N-terminal signals are classified as UPS or intracellular proteins based on physicochemical features directly generated from their amino acid sequences. We are convinced that OutCyte will play a relevant role in the annotation of experimental data and will therefore contribute to further characterization of the extracellular nature of proteins by considering the commonly neglected UPS proteins. OutCyte has been implemented as a web server atwww.outcyte.com.",
