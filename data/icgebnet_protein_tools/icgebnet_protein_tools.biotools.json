Results: A sphere of predetermined radius is centered around each non-hydrogen atom, and the volume occupied by the protein and the free volume within the sphere (internal and external volumes, respectively) are calculated. Atoms in protruding regions have a high ratio (cx) between the external and the internal volume. The program reads a PDB file, and writes the output in the same format, with cx values in the B factor field. Output structure files can be directly displayed with standard molecular graphics programs like RASMOL, MOLMOL, Swiss-PDB Viewer and colored according to cx values. We show the potential use of this program in the analysis of two protein-protein complexes and in the prediction of limited proteolysis sites in native proteins.",

The comparison is carried out by contingency table analysis and yields a probability of identity (PRIDE score), with values between zero and 1. For closely related structures, PRIDE is highly correlated with the root-mean-square distance between C\u03b1 atoms, but it provides a correct classification even for unrelated structures for which a structural alignment is not meaningful. For example, an analysis of the CATH database of fold structures showed that 98.8% of the folds fall into the correct CATH homologous superfamily category, based on the highest PRIDE score obtained. Structural alignment and secondary-structure assignment are not necessary for the calculation of PRIDE, which is fast enough to allow the scanning of large databases. \u00a9 2002 Academic Press.",

DPX calculates a depth index for the buried atoms and makes it possible to analyze the distribution of buried residues.
