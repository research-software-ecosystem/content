Here, we present two webservers for multiple alignment and recognition of binding patterns shared by a set of protein structures. The first webserver, MultiBind (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MultiBind), performs multiple alignment of protein binding sites. It recognizes the common spatial chemical binding patterns even in the absence of similarity of the sequences or the folds of the compared proteins. The input to the MultiBind server is a set of protein-binding sites defined by interactions with small molecules. The output is a detailed list of the shared physico-chemical binding site properties. The second webserver, MAPPIS (http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/MAPPIS), aims to analyze protein-protein interactions. It performs multiple alignment of protein-protein interfaces (PPIs), which are regions of interaction between two protein molecules. MAPPIS recognizes the spatially conserved physico-chemical interactions, which often involve energetically important hot-spot residues that are crucial for protein-protein associations. The input to the MAPPIS server is a set of protein-protein complexes. The output is a detailed list of the shared interaction properties of the interfaces.","authors":["Shulman-Peleg A.","Shatsky M.","Nussinov R.","Wolfson H.J."],"cit_count":65,"journal":"Nucleic acids research","pmid":"18467424","title":"MultiBind and MAPPIS: webservers for multiple alignment of protein 3D-binding sites and their interactions.","year":"2008-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mappis","biotoolsID":"mappis","description":"Multiple Alignment of Protein-Protein Interfaces (MAPPIS) is a tool for the recognition of spatially conserved chemical interactions shared by a set of protein-protein interfaces or regions of protein interaction.
