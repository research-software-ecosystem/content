The model generates segmentation masks of the brain parenchyma and lesions in PML patients.\n\nThis work was conducted at the Neuroimmunology Clinic (NIC) and Translation Neuroradiology Section (TNS) of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), in collaboration with colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health, and the Henry Jackson Foundation at the National Institutes of Health.",
