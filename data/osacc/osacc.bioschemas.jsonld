However, an easy-to-use interactive online tool is needed to analyze these profiling and clinical data. In the current work, we developed OSacc (Online consensus Survival analysis of ACC), a web tool that provides rapid and user-friendly survival analysis based on seven independent transcriptomic profiles with long-term clinical follow-up information of 259 ACC patients gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. OSacc allows researchers and clinicians to evaluate the prognostic value of genes of interest by Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival plot with hazard ratio (HR) and log-rank test in ACC.",
