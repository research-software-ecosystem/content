                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 The AuthorsRecent advances in ligation-free, genome-wide chromatin interaction mapping, such as split-pool recognition of interactions by tag extension (SPRITE) and ChIA-Drop, have enabled the identification of simultaneous interactions involving multiple genomic loci within the same nuclei, which are informative to delineate higher-order genome organization and gene regulation mechanisms at single-nucleus resolution. Unfortunately, computational methods for analyzing multi-way chromatin interaction data are significantly underexplored. Here, we develop an algorithm called MATCHA, based on hypergraph representation learning, where multi-way chromatin interactions are represented as hyperedges. Applications to SPRITE and ChIA-Drop data suggest that MATCHA is effective to denoise the data and make de novo predictions, which greatly enhances the data quality for analyzing the properties of multi-way chromatin interactions. MATCHA provides a promising framework to significantly improve the analysis of multi-way chromatin interaction data and has the potential to offer unique insights into higher-order chromosome organization and function. MATCHA is freely available for download here: https://github.com/ma-compbio/MATCHA. A new computational framework called MATCHA facilitates the analysis of multi-way chromatin interaction data to delineate unique principles of 3D genome structure and function.",
