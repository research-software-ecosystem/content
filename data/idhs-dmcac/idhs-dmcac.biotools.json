                "abstract": "© 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are associated with regulatory DNA elements, so their good understanding is significant for both the biomedical research and the discovery of new drugs. Traditional experimental methods are laborious, time consuming and an inaccurately task to detect DHSs. More importantly, with the avalanche of genome sequences in the postgenomic age, it is highly essential to develop cost-effective computational approaches to identify DHSs. In this paper, we develop a statistical feature extraction model using the detrended moving-average cross-correlation (DMCA) coefficient descriptor based on dinucleotide property matrix generated by the 15 DNA dinucleotide properties, and this model is named iDHS-DMCAC. A 105-dimensional feature vector is constructed for a certain window on the two class imbalanced benchmark datasets, with over-sampling and support vector machine algorithms. Rigorous cross-validations indicate that our predictor remarkably outperforms the existing models in both accuracy and stability. We anticipate that iDHS-DMCAC will become a very useful high throughput tool, or at the very least, a complementary tool to the existing methods of identifying DNase I hypersensitive sites. The datasets and source codes of the proposed model are freely available at https://github.com/shengli0201/Datasets.",
