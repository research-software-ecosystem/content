    "description": "TMIC-07. HYPOXIC MICROENVIRONMENT CONFERS SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS IN DNA METHYLATION PROFILES IN GLIOBLASTOMA.\n\nAbstractHigh cellularity and poorly organized tumour vasculature in high-grade gliomas leads to insufficient blood supply, hypoxic areas, and ultimately to the formation of necrosis. Thus, hypoxia is a hallmark of malignant glioma microenvironment and it is associated with aggressive tumor behavior such as growth, progression, and resistance to chemo-radiation. Current pathologic markers are insufficient to identify patients that may benefit from specific treatments. We therefore, hypothesized that underlying epigenetic alterations confer therapeutic resistance under hypoxic conditions.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Diffeomorphic (IC.OUP.COM).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PIMO', 'conumee' (bio.tools/conumee), 'hypoxia', 'hypoxic'",
