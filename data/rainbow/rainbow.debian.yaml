description: Efficient tool for clustering and assembling short reads, especially
  for RAD. . Rainbow is developed to provide an ultra-fast and memory-efficient solution
  to clustering and assembling short reads produced by RAD-seq. First, Rainbow clusters
  reads using a spaced seed method. Then, Rainbow implements a heterozygote calling
  like strategy to divide potential groups into haplotypes in a top-down manner. long
  a guided tree, it iteratively merges sibling leaves in a bottom-up manner if they
  are similar enough. Here, the similarity is defined by comparing the 2nd reads of
  a RAD segment. This approach tries to collapse heterozygote while discriminate repetitive
  sequences. At last, Rainbow uses a greedy algorithm to locally assemble merged reads
  into contigs. Rainbow not only outputs the optimal but also suboptimal assembly
  results. Based on simulation and a real guppy RAD-seq data, it is shown that Rainbow
  is more competent than the other tools in dealing with RAD-seq data.
