By clustering paired-end short reads into groups with their own unique tags, RAD-seq assembly problem is divided into subproblems. Fast and accurately clustering and assembling millions of RAD-seq reads with sequencing errors, different levels of heterozygosity and repetitive sequences is a challenging question. Results: Rainbow is developed to provide an ultra-fast and memoryefficient solution to clustering and assembling short reads produced by RAD-seq. First, Rainbow clusters reads using a spaced seed method. Then, Rainbow implements a heterozygote calling like strategy to divide potential groups into haplotypes in a top-down manner. And along a guided tree, it iteratively merges sibling leaves in a bottom-up manner if they are similar enough. Here, the similarity is defined by comparing the 2nd reads of a RAD segment. This approach tries to collapse heterozygote while discriminate repetitive sequences. At last, Rainbow uses a greedy algorithm to locally assemble merged reads into contigs. Rainbow not only outputs the optimal but also suboptimal assembly results. Based on simulation and a real guppy RAD-seq data, we show that Rainbow is more competent than the other tools in dealing with RAD-seq data. \u00a9 2012 The Author.", "citationCount": 40, "authors": [{"name": "Chong Z."}, {"name": "Ruan J."}, {"name": "Wu C.-I."}], "date": "2012-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rainbow", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["v2.0.4"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "RAD-seq related clustering and de novo assembly.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/rainbow-v2-0-3-clustering-assembling-short-reads-rad.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "rainbow", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:12:03Z", "name": "Rainbow", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-rainbow/files/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
