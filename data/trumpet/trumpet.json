However, due to the intrinsic properties of RNA molecules and the intricate procedures of this technique, m6A-seq data often suffer from various flaws. A convenient and comprehensive tool is needed to assess the quality of m6A-seq data to ensure that they are suitable for subsequent analysis. Results: From a technical perspective, m6A-seq can be considered as a combination of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq; hence, by effectively combing the data quality assessment metrics of the two techniques, we developed the trumpet R package for evaluation of m6A-seq data quality. The trumpet package takes the aligned BAM files from m6A-seq data together with the transcriptome information as the inputs to generate a quality assessment report in the HTML format. Conclusions: The trumpet R package makes a valuable tool for assessing the data quality of m6A-seq, and it is also applicable to other fragmented RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing techniques, including m1A-seq, CeU-Seq, \u03a8-seq, etc.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Zhang T."}, {"name": "Zhang S.-W."}, {"name": "Zhang L."}, {"name": "Meng J."}], "date": "2018-07-13T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Teng Zhang", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "tengzhagn156@126.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:trumpet", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["0.3.6"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/skyhorsetomoon/Trumpet", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2928"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Validation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The package is designed for the quality assessment of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing data.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "trumpet", "additionDate": "2018-07-29T10:56:00Z", "name": "trumpet", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/skyhorsetomoon/Trumpet/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
