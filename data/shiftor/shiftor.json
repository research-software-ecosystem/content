                "title": "Accurate prediction of protein torsion angles using chemical shifts and sequence homology", 
                "abstract": "Torsion angle restraints are frequently used in the determination and refinement of protein structures by NMR. These restraints may be obtained by J coupling, cross-correlation measurements, nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) or secondary chemical shifts. Currently most backbone (φ/ψ) torsion angles are determined using a combination of JHNHα couplings and chemical shift measurements while most side-chain (χ1) angles and cis/trans peptide bond angles (ω) are determined via NOEs. The dependency on multiple experimental (and computational) methods to obtain different torsion angle restraints is both time-consuming and error prone. The situation could be greatly improved if the determination of all torsion angles (φ, ψ, χ and ω) could be made via a single type of measurement (i.e. chemical shifts). Here we describe a program, called SHIFTOR, that is able to accurately predict a large number of protein torsion angles (φ, ψ, ω, χ1) using only 1H, 13C and 15N chemical shift assignments as input. Overall, the program is 100× faster and its predictions are approximately 20% better than existing methods. The program is also capable of predicting χ1 angles with 81% accuracy and ω angles with 100% accuracy. SHIFTOR exploits many of the recent developments and observations regarding chemical shift dependencies as well as using information in the Protein Databank to improve the quality of its shift-derived torsion angle predictions.
