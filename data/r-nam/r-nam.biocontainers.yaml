description: Designed for association studies in nested association mapping (NAM)
  panels, experimental and random panels. The method is described by Xavier et al.
  (2015) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv448>. It includes tools for genome-wide associations
  of multiple populations, marker quality control, population genetics analysis, genome-wide
  prediction, solving mixed models and finding variance components through likelihood
  and Bayesian methods.
