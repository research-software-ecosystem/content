A number of available algorithms can help search these datasets to uncover patterns associated with specific traits, including disease-related attributes. While, in many instances, treating an algorithm as a black box is sufficient, it is interesting to pursue an enhanced understanding of how system variables end up contributing to a specific output, as an avenue towards new mechanistic insight. Here we address this challenge through a suite of algorithms, named BowSaw, which takes advantage of the structure of a trained random forest algorithm to identify combinations of variables (“rules”) frequently used for classification","homepage":"https://github.com/ddimucci/BowSaw","name":"BowSaw"}}
