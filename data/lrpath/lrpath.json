Summary: Tests for differential gene expression with RNA-seq data have a tendency to identify certain types of transcripts as significant, e.g. longer and highly-expressed transcripts. This tendency has been shown to bias gene set enrichment (GSE) testing, which is used to find over- or under-represented biological functions in the data. Yet, there remains a surprising lack of tools for GSE testing specific for RNA-seq. We present a new GSE method for RNA-seq data, RNA-Enrich, that accounts for the above tendency empirically by adjusting for average read count per gene. RNA-Enrich is a quick, flexible method and web-based tool, with 16 available gene annotation databases. It does not require a P-value cut-off to define differential expression, and works well even with small sample-sized experiments. We show that adjusting for read counts per gene improves both the type I error rate and detection power of the test. Availability and implementation: RNA-Enrich is available at http://lrpath.ncibi.org or from supplemental material as R code.", "citationCount": 8, "authors": [{"name": "Lee C."}, {"name": "Patil S."}, {"name": "Sartor M.A."}], "date": "2016-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://sartorlab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "snehal@med.umich.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:lrpath", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lrpath.ncibi.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway or network analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Regression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3659"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "LRpath performs gene set enrichment testing using logistic regression, and allows the data to remain on a continuous scale.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/lrpath-pathway-analysis-using-logistic-regression.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "lrpath", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:48:15Z", "name": "LRpath", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://lrpath.ncibi.org/method.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
