  "sc:description": "A Collection of Tools for Viral Quasispecies Analysis | Abstract Summary quasitools is a collection of newly-developed, open-source tools for analyzing viral quasispcies data. The application suite includes tools with the ability to create consensus sequences, call nucleotide, codon, and amino acid variants, calculate the complexity of a quasispecies, and measure the genetic distance between two similar quasispecies. These tools may be run independently or in user-created workflows. Availability The quasitools suite is a freely available application licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
