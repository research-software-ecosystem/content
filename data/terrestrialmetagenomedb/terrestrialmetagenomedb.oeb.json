        "description": "a public repository of curated and standardized metadata for terrestrial metagenomes.\n\nABSTRACT Microbiome studies focused on the genetic potential of microbial communities (metagenomics) became standard within microbial ecology. MG-RAST and the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the two main metagenome repositories, contain over 202 858 public available metagenomes and this number has increased exponentially. However, mining databases can be challenging due to misannotated, misleading and decentralized data. The main goal of TerrestrialMetagenomeDB is to make it easier for scientists to find terrestrial metagenomes of interest that could be compared with novel datasets in meta-analyses. We defined terrestrial metagenomes as those that do not belong to marine environments. Further, we curated the database using text mining to assign potential descriptive keywords that better contextualize environmental aspects of terrestrial metagenomes, such as biomes and materials",
