Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Adjutant is an open-source, interactive and R-based application to support mining PubMed for literature reviews. Given a PubMed-compatible search query, Adjutant downloads the relevant articles and allows the user to perform an unsupervised clustering analysis to identify data-driven topic clusters. Following clustering, users can also sample documents using different strategies to obtain a more manageable dataset for further analysis. Adjutant makes explicit trade-offs between speed and accuracy, which are modifiable by the user, such that a complete analysis of several thousand documents can take a few minutes. All analytic datasets generated by Adjutant are saved, allowing users to easily conduct other downstream analyses that Adjutant does not explicitly support.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Crisan A."}, {"name": "Munzner T."}, {"name": "Gardy J.L."}], "date": "2019-03-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Anamaria Crisan", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "acrisan@cs.ubc.ca"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:Adjutant", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/amcrisan/Adjutant", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Text mining", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0306"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-06T06:25:02Z", "otherID": [], "description": "R-based tool to support topic discovery for systematic and literature reviews.", "toolType": ["Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/amcrisan/Adjutant/issues", "note": null, "type": "Issue tracker"}], "biotoolsID": "Adjutant", "additionDate": "2019-07-06T06:25:02Z", "name": "Adjutant", "license": "MIT", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/amcrisan/Adjutant/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
