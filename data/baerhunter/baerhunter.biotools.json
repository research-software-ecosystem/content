    "description": "An R package for the discovery and analysis of expressed non-coding regions in bacterial RNA-seq data | Detection and Analyis of Expressed Intergenic Elements in Bacterial RNA-seq Data | The baerhunter package comprises a set of tools for the prediction, annotation and filtering of bacterial intergenic expressed regions from RNA-seq data. In addition, it supports further stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, such as transcript abundance quantification and differential gene expression testing. It also offers additional options for the selection of genomic features by their expression strength and editing of the annotation file",

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Summary: Standard bioinformatics pipelines for the analysis of bacterial transcriptomic data commonly ignore non-coding but functional elements e.g. small RNAs, long antisense RNAs or untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA transcripts. The root of this problem is the use of incomplete genome annotation files. Here, we present baerhunter, a coverage-based method implemented in R, that automates the discovery of expressed non-coding RNAs and UTRs from RNA-seq reads mapped to a reference genome. The core algorithm is part of a pipeline that facilitates downstream analysis of both coding and non-coding features. The method is simple, easy to extend and customize and, in limited tests with simulated and real data, compares favourably against the currently most popular alternative.",
