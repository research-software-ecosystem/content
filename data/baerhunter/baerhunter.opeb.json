In addition, it supports further stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, such as transcript abundance quantification and differential gene expression testing. It also offers additional options for the selection of genomic features by their expression strength and editing of the annotation file","homepage":"https://github.com/irilenia/baerhunter","name":"baerhunter"}}
