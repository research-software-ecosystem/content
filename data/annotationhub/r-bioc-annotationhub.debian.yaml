  description: GNU R client to access AnnotationHub resources
  long_description: " This package provides a client for the Bioconductor AnnotationHub\
    \ web\n resource. The AnnotationHub web resource provides a central location\n\
    \ where genomic files (e.g., VCF, bed, wig) and other resources from\n standard\
    \ locations (e.g., UCSC, Ensembl) can be discovered. The resource\n includes metadata\
    \ about each resource, e.g., a textual description,\n tags, and date of modification.\
    \ The client creates and manages a local\n cache of files retrieved by the user,\
    \ helping with quick and\n reproducible access.\n"
