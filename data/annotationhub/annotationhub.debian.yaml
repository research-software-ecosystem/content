summary: GNU R client to access AnnotationHub resources
description: >
  This package provides a client for the Bioconductor AnnotationHub web
  resource. The AnnotationHub web resource provides a central location
  where genomic files (e.g., VCF, bed, wig) and other resources from
  standard locations (e.g., UCSC, Ensembl) can be discovered. The resource
  includes metadata about each resource, e.g., a textual description,
  tags, and date of modification. The client creates and manages a local
  cache of files retrieved by the user, helping with quick and
  reproducible access.
version: 2.18.0
