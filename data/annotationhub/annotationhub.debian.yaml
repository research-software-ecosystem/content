description: "This package provides a client for the Bioconductor AnnotationHub web\
  \ resource. The AnnotationHub web resource provides a central location where genomic\
  \ files (e.g., VCF, bed, wig) and other resources from standard locations (e.g.,\
  \ UCSC, Ensembl) can be discovered. The resource includes metadata about each resource,\
  \ e.g., a textual description, tags, and date of modification. The client creates\
  \ and manages a local cache of files retrieved by the user, helping with quick and\
  \ reproducible access.\n"
