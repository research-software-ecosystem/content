biotools_id: annotationhub
description: This package provides a client for the Bioconductor AnnotationHub web
  resource. The AnnotationHub web resource provides a central location where genomic
  files (e.g., VCF, bed, wig) and other resources from standard locations (e.g., UCSC,
  Ensembl) can be discovered. The resource includes metadata about each resource,
  e.g., a textual description, tags, and date of modification. The client creates
  and manages a local cache of files retrieved by the user, helping with quick and
  reproducible access.
