summary: screen DNA sequences for interspersed repeats
description: >
   RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed
   repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is
   a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query
   sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which
   all the annotated repeats have been masked (default: replaced by
   Ns). Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are performed by the program
   cross_match, an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh
   algorithm developed by Phil Green, or by WU-Blast developed by Warren
   Gish.
