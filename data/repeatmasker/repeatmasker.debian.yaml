  description: screen DNA sequences for interspersed repeats
  long_description: " RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed\n\
    \ repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is\n a detailed\
    \ annotation of the repeats that are present in the query\n sequence as well as\
    \ a modified version of the query sequence in which\n all the annotated repeats\
    \ have been masked (default: replaced by\n Ns). Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker\
    \ are performed by the program\n cross_match, an efficient implementation of the\
    \ Smith-Waterman-Gotoh\n algorithm developed by Phil Green, or by WU-Blast developed\
    \ by Warren\n Gish."
