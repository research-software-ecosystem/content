  description: screen DNA sequences for interspersed repeats
  long_description: " RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed\n\
    \ repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is\n a detailed
    annotation of the repeats that are present in the query\n sequence as well as
    a modified version of the query sequence in which\n all the annotated repeats
    have been masked (default: replaced by\n Ns). Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker
    are performed by the program\n cross_match, an efficient implementation of the
    Smith-Waterman-Gotoh\n algorithm developed by Phil Green, or by WU-Blast developed
    by Warren\n Gish."
