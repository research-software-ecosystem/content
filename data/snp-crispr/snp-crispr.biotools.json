Look no further! We can help you find CRISPR guide designs (both -NGG and -NAG) in Fly, Human, Mouse, Zebrafish, and Rat genomes. Each guide will be given an efficiency and off-target score based on our algorithms so that you can plan accordingly. Targeting multiple variants within the same guide is also available (select the checkbox)!.\n\nOnline version available at: https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/snp_crispr.\n\nDRSC tool for search and view of pre-computed CRISPR designs for genome engineering (knock-out or knock-in) in Drosophila.\n\nDRSC/TRiP Functional Genomics Resources.\n\n— Rational design of CRISPR/Cas target.\n\nEnter an accession number (e.g",

                "abstract": "Copyright © 2020 Chen et al.CRISPR-Cas9 is a powerful genome editing technology in which a single guide RNA (sgRNA) confers target site specificity to achieve Cas9-mediated genome editing. Numerous sgRNA design tools have been developed based on reference genomes for humans and model organisms. However, existing resources are not optimal as genetic mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the targeting region affect the efficiency of CRISPR-based approaches by interfering with guide-target complementarity. To facilitate identification of sgRNAs (1) in non-reference genomes, (2) across varying genetic backgrounds, or (3) for specific targeting of SNP-containing alleles, for example, disease relevant mutations, we developed a web tool, SNP-CRISPR (https://www.flyrnai.org/tools/snp_crispr/). SNP-CRISPR can be used to design sgRNAs based on public variant data sets or user-identified variants. In addition, the tool computes efficiency and specificity scores for sgRNA designs targeting both the variant and the reference. Moreover, SNP-CRISPR provides the option to upload multiple SNPs and target single or multiple nearby base changes simultaneously with a single sgRNA design. Given these capabilities, SNPCRISPR has a wide range of potential research applications in model systems and for design of sgRNAs for disease-associated variant correction.",
