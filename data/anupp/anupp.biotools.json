Most algorithms developed so far to identify potential aggregation prone regions (APRs) use amino acid residue composition and/or sequence pattern features. In this work, we have investigated the importance of atomic-level characteristics rather than residue level to understand the initiation of aggregation in proteins and peptides. Using atomic-level features an ensemble-classifier, ANuPP has been developed to predict the aggregation-nucleating regions in peptides and proteins. In a dataset of 1279 hexapeptides, ANuPP achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.831 with 77% accuracy on 10-fold cross-validation and an AUC of 0.883 with 83% accuracy in a blind test dataset of 142 hexapeptides. Further, it showed an average SOV of 48.7% on identifying APR regions in 37 proteins. The performance of ANuPP is better than other methods reported in the literature on both amyloidogenic hexapeptide prediction and APR identification. We have developed a web server for ANuPP and it is available at https://web.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo2/ANuPP/. Insights gained from this work demonstrate the importance of atomic and functional group characteristics towards diversity of atomic level origins as well as mechanisms of protein aggregation.",
