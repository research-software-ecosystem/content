      "sc:description": "A local consistency approach for nutrigenomics data analysis.\n\nNutrigenomics aims at understanding the interaction between nutrition and gene information. Due to the complex interactions of nutrients and genes, their relationship exhibits non-linearity. One of the most effective and efficient methods to explore their relationship is the nutritional geometry framework which fits a response surface for the gene expression over two prespecified nutrition variables. However, when the number of nutrients involved is large, it is challenging to find combinations of informative nutrients with respect to a certain gene and to test whether the relationship is stronger than chance. Methods for identifying informative combinations are essential to understanding the relationship between nutrients and genes.<h4>Results< h4>We introduce Local Consistency Nutrition to Graphics (LC-N2G), a novel approach for ranking and identifying combinations of nutrients with gene expression",
