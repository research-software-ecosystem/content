In this context an important aspect is the reduction of data complexity by collapsing redundant reads in a single cluster to improve the run time, memory requirements, and quality of post-processing steps like assembly and error correction. Several alignment-free measures, based on k-mers counts, have been used to cluster reads. Quality scores produced by NGS platforms are fundamental for various analysis of NGS data like reads mapping and error detection. Moreover future-generation sequencing platforms will produce long reads but with a large number of erroneous bases (up to 15%). Thus it will be fundamental to exploit quality value information within the alignment-free framework. In this paper we present a family of alignment-free measures, called D q -type, that incorporate quality value information and k-mers counts for the comparison of reads data. A set of experiments on simulated and real reads data confirms that the new measures are superior to other classical alignment-free statistics, especially when erroneous reads are considered. These measures are implemented in a software called QCluster (http://www.dei.unipd.it/\u223cciompin/main/ qcluster.html). \u00a9 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Comin M."}, {"name": "Leoni A."}, {"name": "Schimd M."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ELIXIR-ITA-PADOVA", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Matteo Comin", "url": "http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ciompin/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "comin@dei.unipd.it"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:qcluster", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ciompin/main/qcluster.html", "function": [{"note": "Assembly booster, reads clustering", "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0291"}, {"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "NGS reads clustering", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "qcluster", "additionDate": "2015-01-22T11:40:42Z", "name": "QCluster", "license": "Other", "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.dei.unipd.it/~ciompin/main/qcluster.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
