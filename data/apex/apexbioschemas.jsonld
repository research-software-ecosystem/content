  "sc:description": "Absolute protein expression Quantitative Proteomics Tool, is a free and open source Java implementation of the APEX technique for the quantitation of proteins based on standard LC- MS/MS proteomics data. This technique uses machine learning algorithms to help correct for variable peptide detection related to certain peptide physicochemical properties which favor or hinder detection. A sample data set and descriptive tutorial help to acquaint users with the operation of the tool.",
