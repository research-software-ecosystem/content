    "description": "Absolute protein expression Quantitative Proteomics Tool, is a free and open source Java implementation of the APEX technique for the quantitation of proteins based on standard LC- MS/MS proteomics data. This technique uses machine learning algorithms to help correct for variable peptide detection related to certain peptide physicochemical properties which favor or hinder detection. A sample data set and descriptive tutorial help to acquaint users with the operation of the tool.",

                "abstract": "We report a method for large-scale absolute protein expression measurements (APEX) and apply it to estimate the relative contributions of transcriptional- and translational-level gene regulation in the yeast and Escherichia coli proteomes. APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations with mRNA abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate that 73% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47% in E. coli) is explained by mRNA abundance, with the number of proteins per mRNA log-normally distributed about \u223c5,600 (\u223c540 in E. coli) protein molecules/mRNA. Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per mRNA molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with >70% of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through mRNA-directed mechanisms. \u00a9 2007 Nature Publishing Group.",
