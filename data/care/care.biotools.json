For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation: Error correction is a fundamental pre-processing step in many Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) pipelines, in particular for de novo genome assembly. However, existing error correction methods either suffer from high false-positive rates since they break reads into independent k-mers or do not scale efficiently to large amounts of sequencing reads and complex genomes. Results: We present CARE - an alignment-based scalable error correction algorithm for Illumina data using the concept of minhashing. Minhashing allows for efficient similarity search within large sequencing read collections which enables fast computation of high-quality multiple alignments. Sequencing errors are corrected by detailed inspection of the corresponding alignments. Our performance evaluation shows that CARE generates significantly fewer false-positive corrections than state-of-the-art tools (Musket, SGA, BFC, Lighter, Bcool, Karect) while maintaining a competitive number of true positives. When used prior to assembly it can achieve superior de novo assembly results for a number of real datasets. CARE is also the first multiple sequence alignment-based error corrector that is able to process a human genome Illumina NGS dataset in only 4 h on a single workstation using GPU acceleration. Availabilityand implementation: CARE is open-source software written in C++ (CPU version) and in CUDA/C++ (GPU version).
