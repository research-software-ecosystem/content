  description: BAM/CRAM depth calculation biological sequencing
  long_description: " Many small reads are produced by high-throughput \"next generation\"\
    \n sequencing technologies. The final sequence is derived from how\n these reads\
    \ are overlapping towards a consensus.\n The more reads are covering/confirming\
    \ parts of a nucleotide seq,\n the higher the confidence is. Too many reads would\
    \ be indicative\n of e.g. repeats in the genome.\n .\n mosdepth can output:\n\
    \  *  per-base depth about 2x as fast samtools depth--about 25 minutes\n     of\
    \ CPU time for a 30X genome.\n  *  mean per-window depth given a window size--as\
    \ would be used for\n     CNV calling.\n  *  the mean per-region given a BED file\
    \ of regions.\n  *  a distribution of proportion of bases covered at or above\
    \ a given\n     threshold for each chromosome and genome-wide.\n  *  quantized\
    \ output that merges adjacent bases as long as they fall\n     in the same coverage\
    \ bins e.g. (10-20)\n  *  threshold output to indicate how many bases in each\
    \ region are\n     covered at the given thresholds.\n when appropriate, the output\
    \ files are bgzipped and indexed for ease\n of use.\n"
