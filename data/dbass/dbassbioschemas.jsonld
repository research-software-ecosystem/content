Aberrant 5’- and 3’-splice sites were activated either by mutations in the consensus sequences of natural exon-intron junctions or elsewhere. Data can be searched by disease phenotype, gene, mutation, location of aberrant splice sites in introns and exons and their distance from authentic counterparts, by bibliographic references and by the algorithm-estimated splice-site strength.",
