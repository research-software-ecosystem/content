summary: flexible read trimming tool for Illumina NGS data
description: >
   Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina
   paired-end and single ended data.The selection of trimming steps and
   their associated parameters are supplied on the command line.
   .
   The current trimming steps are:
    * ILLUMINACLIP: Cut adapter and other illumina-specific sequences from
      the read.
    * SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once thes
      average quality within the window falls below a threshold.
    * LEADING: Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality
    * TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality
    * CROP: Cut the read to a specified length
    * HEADCROP: Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read
    * MINLENGTH: Drop the read if it is below a specified length
    * TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33
    * TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64
   It works with FASTQ (using phred + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores,
   depending on the Illumina pipeline used), either uncompressed or
   gzipp'ed FASTQ. Use of gzip format is determined based on the .gz
   extension.
