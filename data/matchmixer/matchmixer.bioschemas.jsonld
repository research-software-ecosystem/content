      "sc:description": "A cross-platform normalization method for gene expression data integration.\n\nMOTIVATION:Combining gene expression (GE) profiles generated from different platforms enables previously infeasible studies due to sample size limitations. Several cross-platform normalization methods have been developed to remove the systematic differences between platforms, but they may also remove meaningful biological differences among datasets. In this work, we propose a novel approach that removes the platform, not the biological differences. Dubbed as 'MatchMixeR', we model platform differences by a linear mixed effects regression (LMER) model, and estimate them from matched GE profiles of the same cell line or tissue measured on different platforms. The resulting model can then be used to remove platform differences in other datasets",
