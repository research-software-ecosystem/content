All rights reserved.Motivation: In the process of discovery and optimization of lead compounds, it is difficult for non-expert pharmacologists to intuitively determine the contribution of substructure to a particular property of a molecule. Results: In this work, we develop a user-friendly web service, named interpretable-absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET), which predict 59 ADMET-associated properties using 90 qualitative classification models and 28 quantitative regression models based on graph convolutional neural network and graph attention network algorithms. In interpretable-ADMET, there are 250 729 entries associated with 59 kinds of ADMET-associated properties for 80 167 chemical compounds. In addition to making predictions, interpretable-ADMET provides interpretation models based on gradient-weighted class activation map for identifying the substructure, which is important to the particular property. Interpretable-ADMET also provides an optimize module to automatically generate a set of novel virtual candidates based on matched molecular pair rules. We believe that interpretable-ADMET could serve as a useful tool for lead optimization in drug discovery.",
