  "sc:description": "A problem when recording 3D fluorescent microscopy images is how to properly present these results in 2D. Maximum intensity projections are a popular method to determine the focal plane of each pixel in the image. The problem with this approach, however, is that out-of-focus elements will still be visible, making edges and fine structures difficult to detect. This package aims to resolve this problem.",
