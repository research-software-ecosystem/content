    "description": "A Visual Analytics Framework for Interactive and Explainable Machine Learning | The framework for explainable AI and interactive machine learning. Making XAI accessible | The recent abundance of artificial intelligence and the resulting spread of black-box models in critical domains has lead to an increasing demand for explainability. The field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence tackles this challenge by providing ways to interpret the decisions of such models. Which, in turn, resulted in a variety of different explaining techniques, all having various dependencies and providing highly diverse outputs | Besides the variety of XAI methods, there also is a variety of user-groups with different interests and requirements. They need tailored access to XAI methods that suit their needs and support them in their daily workflow | Our XAI framework structures the process of XAI",
