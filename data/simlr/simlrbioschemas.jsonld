  "sc:description": "Novel similarity-learning framework, which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension reduction, clustering and visualization. It can separate known subpopulations more accurately in single-cell data sets than do existing dimension reduction methods. Additionally, it demonstrates high sensitivity and accuracy on high-throughput peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) data sets generated by the GemCode single-cell.",
