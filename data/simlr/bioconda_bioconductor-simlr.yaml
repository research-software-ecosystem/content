about:
  description: Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression
    measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within
    cell populations. Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical
    for the identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However,
    single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression
    similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. We develop
    a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel
    LeaRning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension
    reduction, clustering and visualization.
