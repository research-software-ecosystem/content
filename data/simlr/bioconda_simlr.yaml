description: Single-cell RNA-seq technologies enable high throughput gene expression
  measurement of individual cells, and allow the discovery of heterogeneity within
  cell populations. Measurement of cell-to-cell gene expression similarity is critical
  for the identification, visualization and analysis of cell populations. However,
  single-cell data introduce challenges to conventional measures of gene expression
  similarity because of the high level of noise, outliers and dropouts. We develop
  a novel similarity-learning framework, SIMLR (Single-cell Interpretation via Multi-kernel
  LeaRning), which learns an appropriate distance metric from the data for dimension
  reduction, clustering and visualization.
