Its success depends on several key factors, including the precision of a given search, the time of its accomplishment, and the communicative prowess of the mined information to the users. GeneCite - a stand-alone Java-based high-throughput data mining tool - is designed to carry out these tasks for several important knowledge sources simultaneously, allowing the users to integrate the results and interpret biological significance in a time-efficient manner. GeneCite provides an integrated high-throughput search platform serving as an information retrieval (IR) tool for probing online literature database (PubMed) and the sequence-tagged sites' database (UniSTS), respectively. It also operates as a data retrieval (DR) tool to mine an archive of biological pathways integrated into the software itself. Furthermore, GeneCite supports a retrieved data management system (DMS) showcasing the final output in a spread-sheet format. Each cell of the output file holds a real-time connection (hyperlink) to the given online archive reachable at the users' convenience. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Hammamieh R."}, {"name": "Chakraborty N."}, {"name": "Wang Y."}, {"name": "Laing M."}, {"name": "Liu Z."}, {"name": "Mulligan J."}, {"name": "Jett M."}], "date": "2007-07-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Rasha.Hammamieh1.civ@mail.mil"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:genecite", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bioinformatics.org/wrair/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Generalized query application that allows you to specify sophisticated sets of queries and generates a table of the number of bio-related records found for each query.
