                "abstract": "Systematic extraction of relevant biological facts from available massive scientific knowledge source is emerging as a significant task for the science community. Its success depends on several key factors, including the precision of a given search, the time of its accomplishment, and the communicative prowess of the mined information to the users. GeneCite - a stand-alone Java-based high-throughput data mining tool - is designed to carry out these tasks for several important knowledge sources simultaneously, allowing the users to integrate the results and interpret biological significance in a time-efficient manner. GeneCite provides an integrated high-throughput search platform serving as an information retrieval (IR) tool for probing online literature database (PubMed) and the sequence-tagged sites' database (UniSTS), respectively. It also operates as a data retrieval (DR) tool to mine an archive of biological pathways integrated into the software itself. Furthermore, GeneCite supports a retrieved data management system (DMS) showcasing the final output in a spread-sheet format. Each cell of the output file holds a real-time connection (hyperlink) to the given online archive reachable at the users' convenience. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",
