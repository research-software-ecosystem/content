Its success depends on several key factors, including the precision of a given search, the time of its accomplishment, and the communicative prowess of the mined information to the users. GeneCite - a stand-alone Java-based high-throughput data mining tool - is designed to carry out these tasks for several important knowledge sources simultaneously, allowing the users to integrate the results and interpret biological significance in a time-efficient manner. GeneCite provides an integrated high-throughput search platform serving as an information retrieval (IR) tool for probing online literature database (PubMed) and the sequence-tagged sites' database (UniSTS), respectively. It also operates as a data retrieval (DR) tool to mine an archive of biological pathways integrated into the software itself. Furthermore, GeneCite supports a retrieved data management system (DMS) showcasing the final output in a spread-sheet format. Each cell of the output file holds a real-time connection (hyperlink) to the given online archive reachable at the users' convenience. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","authors":["Hammamieh R.","Chakraborty N.","Wang Y.","Laing M.","Liu Z.","Mulligan J.","Jett M."],"cit_count":7,"journal":"OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology","pmid":"17594234","title":"GeneCite: A stand-alone open source tool for high-throughput literature and pathway mining","year":"2007-07-06"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:genecite","biotoolsID":"genecite","description":"Generalized query application that allows you to specify sophisticated sets of queries and generates a table of the number of bio-related records found for each query.
