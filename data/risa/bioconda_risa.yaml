description: The Investigation / Study / Assay (ISA) tab-delimited format is a general
  purpose framework with which to collect and communicate complex metadata (i.e. sample
  characteristics, technologies used, type of measurements made) from experiments
  employing a combination of technologies, spanning from traditional approaches to
  high-throughput techniques. Risa allows to access metadata/data in ISA-Tab format
  and build Bioconductor data structures. Currently, data generated from microarray,
  flow cytometry and metabolomics-based (i.e. mass spectrometry) assays are supported.
  The package is extendable and efforts are undergoing to support metadata associated
  to proteomics assays.
