Epitopes occupy a central place in integrative biology, not to mention as targets for novel vaccine, pharmaceutical, and systems diagnostics development. The presence of T-cell and B-cell epitopes has been extensively studied due to their potential in synthetic vaccine design. However, reliable prediction of linear B-cell epitope remains a formidable challenge. Earlier studies have reported discrepancy in amino acid composition between the epitopes and non-epitopes. Hence, this study proposed and developed a novel amino acid composition-based feature descriptor, Dipeptide Deviation from Expected Mean (DDE), to distinguish the linear B-cell epitopes from non-epitopes effectively. In this study, for the first time, only exact linear B-cell epitopes and non-epitopes have been utilized for developing the prediction method, unlike the use of epitope-containing regions in earlier reports. To evaluate the performance of the DDE feature vector, models have been developed with two widely used machine-learning techniques Support Vector Machine and AdaBoost-Random Forest. Five-fold cross-validation performance of the proposed method with error-free dataset and dataset from other studies achieved an overall accuracy between nearly 61% and 73%, with balance between sensitivity and specificity metrics. Performance of the DDE feature vector was better (with accuracy difference of about 2% to 12%), in comparison to other amino acid-derived features on different datasets. This study reflects the efficiency of the DDE feature vector in enhancing the linear B-cell epitope prediction performance, compared to other feature representations. The proposed method is made as a stand-alone tool available freely for researchers, particularly for those interested in vaccine design and novel molecular target development for systems therapeutics and diagnostics: https://github.com/brsaran/LBEEP", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Saravanan V."}, {"name": "Gautham N."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "OMICS A Journal of Integrative Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Developer"], "name": "Saravanan Vijayakumar", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5145-0384", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "brsaran@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:LBEEP", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/brsaran/LBEEP", "function": [{"note": "Can be run for both protein and peptides", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Protein sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2976"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Peptide immunogenicity prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0252"}], "cmd": "./LBEEP -i test_input_peptides -m pep -M B -o Test_peptide", "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA-HTML", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2310"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2019-05-15T07:13:08Z", "otherID": [], "description": "LBEEP (Linear B-Cell Exact Epitope Predictor) is a perl based open source tool for the prediction of Linear B-cell epitopes.
