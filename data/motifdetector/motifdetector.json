Results: (1) We design a randomized algorithm for consensus pattern problem. We can show that with high probability, our randomized algorithm finds a pattern in polynomial time with cost error at most \u2208 X l for each string, where l is the length of the motif and \u2208 can be any positive number given by the user. (2) We design an improved EM algorithm that outperforms the original EM algorithm. (3) We develop a software tool, MotifDetector, that uses our randomized algorithm to find good seeds and uses the improved EM algorithm to do local search. We compare MotifDetector with Buhler and Tompa's PROJECTION which is considered to be the best known software for motif detection. Simulations show that MotifDetector is slower than PROJECTION when the pattern length is relatively small, and outperforms PROJECTION when the pattern length becomes large. \u00a9 Imperial College Press.", "citationCount": 21, "authors": [{"name": "Wang L."}, {"name": "Dong L."}], "date": "2005-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Lusheng Wang", "url": "http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~lwang/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "lwang@cs.cityu.edu.hk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:motifdetector", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~lwang/software/motif/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence motif discovery", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Designed to find motifs in multiple DNA sequences.The software\u00a0uses the randomized algorithm to find good seeds and uses the improved EM algorithm to do local search.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/motifdetector-finding-motifs-multiple-dna-sequences.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "motifdetector", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:51:52Z", "name": "MotifDetector", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~lwang/software/motif/index.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
