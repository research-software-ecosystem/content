PEPs decouple metadata from analysis by providing:.\n\nAn open structure and toolkit for organizing large-scale, sample-intensive biological research projects.\n\nA PEP is written using a familiar yaml + csv format that can be read by our R and Python packages, and well as by workflow frameworks. PEP is your metadata solution for sample-intensive research projects.",
