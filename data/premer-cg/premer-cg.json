Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: DNA methylation is an epigenetic change occurring in genomic CpG sequences that contribute to the regulation of gene transcription both in normal and malignant cells. Next-generation sequencing has been used to characterize DNA methylation status at the genome scale, but suffers from high sequencing cost in the case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or from reduced resolution (inability to precisely define which of the CpGs are methylated) with capture-based techniques. Results: Here we present a computational method that computes nucleotide-resolution methylation values from capture-based data by incorporating fragment length profiles into a model of methylation analysis. We demonstrate that it compares favorably with nucleotideresolution bisulfite sequencing and has better predictive power with respect to a reference than window-based methods, often used for enrichment data. The described method was used to produce the methylation data used in tandem with gene expression to produce a novel and clinically significant gene signature in acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, we introduce a complementary statistical method that uses this nucleotide-resolution methylation data for detection of differentially methylated features.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Frankhouser D.E."}, {"name": "Murphy M."}, {"name": "Blachly J.S."}, {"name": "Park J."}, {"name": "Zoller M.W."}, {"name": "Ganbat J.-O."}, {"name": "Curfman J."}, {"name": "Byrd J.C."}, {"name": "Lin S."}, {"name": "Marcucci G."}, {"name": "Yan P."}, {"name": "Bundschuh R."}], "date": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://cannoli.mps.ohio-state.edu/group/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:premer-cg", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/premer/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0415"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Computational approach that harnesses the implicit information associated with library fragment profiles to infer nucleotide-resolution methylation values in addition to read counts data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/premer-cg-probabilistic-extension-of-methylated-reads-at-cpg-resolution.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "premer-cg", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:56:09Z", "name": "PrEMeR-CG", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/premer/PrEMeR-CG_README.txt", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
