All rights reserved.Motivation: DNA methylation is an epigenetic change occurring in genomic CpG sequences that contribute to the regulation of gene transcription both in normal and malignant cells. Next-generation sequencing has been used to characterize DNA methylation status at the genome scale, but suffers from high sequencing cost in the case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or from reduced resolution (inability to precisely define which of the CpGs are methylated) with capture-based techniques. Results: Here we present a computational method that computes nucleotide-resolution methylation values from capture-based data by incorporating fragment length profiles into a model of methylation analysis. We demonstrate that it compares favorably with nucleotideresolution bisulfite sequencing and has better predictive power with respect to a reference than window-based methods, often used for enrichment data. The described method was used to produce the methylation data used in tandem with gene expression to produce a novel and clinically significant gene signature in acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, we introduce a complementary statistical method that uses this nucleotide-resolution methylation data for detection of differentially methylated features.","authors":["Frankhouser D.E.","Murphy M.","Blachly J.S.","Park J.","Zoller M.W.","Ganbat J.-O.","Curfman J.","Byrd J.C.","Lin S.","Marcucci G.","Yan P.","Bundschuh R."],"cit_count":3,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25178460","title":"PrEMeR-CG: Inferring nucleotide level DNA methylation values from MethyICap-seq data","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:premer-cg","biotoolsID":"premer-cg","description":"Computational approach that harnesses the implicit information associated with library fragment profiles to infer nucleotide-resolution methylation values in addition to read counts data.","homepage":"http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/premer/","name":"PrEMeR-CG"}}
