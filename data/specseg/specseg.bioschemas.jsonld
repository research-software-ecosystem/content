      "sc:description": "cross spectral power-based segmentation of neurons and neurites in chronic calcium imaging datasets.\n\nThis Github contains 'SpecSeg', an open source calcium imaging processing toolbox to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in calcium imaging datasets. ROI segmentation is based on cross-spectral power over a range of frequencies and has been tested and optimized for a variety of neuronal compartments (cell bodies, dendrites, axons) and (imaging) techniques (chronic glass windows, GRIN lenses, 1P, 2P). The SpecSeg toolbox contains user-friendly graphical interfaces to detect, adjust ROIs and visualize their activity traces. This pipeline includes code adapted from normcorre (Pnevmatikakis & Giovannucci 2016), to apply motion correction to sbx files. To be able to execute the motion correction, download the code from NoRMCorre and add the code into the matlab path below SpectralSegmentation.",
