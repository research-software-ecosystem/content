It contains a collection of MHC class I and class II ligands and peptide motifs of humans and other species, such as apes, cattle, chicken, and mouse, for example, and is continuously updated. All motifs currently available are accessible as individual entries. Searches for MHC alleles, MHC motifs, natural ligands, T-cell epitopes, source proteins/organisms and references are possible. Hyperlinks to the EMBL and PubMed databases are included. In addition, ligand predictions are available for a number of MHC allelic products. The database content is restricted to published data only.","authors":["Rammensee H.-G.","Bachmann J.","Emmerich N.P.N.","Bachor O.A.","Stevanovic S."],"cit_count":1678,"journal":"Immunogenetics","pmid":"10602881","title":"SYFPEITHI: Database for MHC ligands and peptide motifs","year":"1999-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:syfpeithi","biotoolsID":"syfpeithi","description":"Database comprising more than 7000 peptide sequences known to bind class I and class II MHC molecules.
