The atlas has an isotropic spatial resolution of 60 micrometers, and contains 98 individually delineated structures and sub-structures. It was developed using Pydpiper image registration software to create an average brain of 41 four-month old male and female Fischer 344 rats","homepage":"https://www.nearlab.xyz/fischer344atlas","name":"Fischer 344"}}
