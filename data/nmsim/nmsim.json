First, the protein structure is coarse-grained using the FIRST software. Second, a rigid cluster normal-mode analysis provides low-frequency normal modes. Third, these modes are used to extend the recently introduced idea of constrained geometric simulations by biasing backbone motions of the protein, whereas side chain motions are biased toward favorable rotamer states (NMSim). The generated structures are iteratively corrected regarding steric clashes and stereochemical constraint violations. The approach allows performing three simulation types: unbiased exploration of conformational space; pathway generation by a targeted simulation; and radius of gyration-guided simulation. On a data set of proteins with experimentally observed conformational changes, the NMSim approach has been shown to be a computationally efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for conformational sampling of proteins. The generated conformations and pathways of conformational transitions can serve as input to docking approaches or more sophisticated sampling techniques. The web server output is a trajectory of generated conformations, Jmol representations of the coarse-graining and a subset of the trajectory and data plots of structural analyses. The NMSim webserver, accessible at http://www.nmsim.de, is free and open to all users with no login requirement. \u00a9 2012 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 43, "authors": [{"name": "Kruger D.M."}, {"name": "Ahmed A."}, {"name": "Gohlke H."}], "date": "2012-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "support@nmsim.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:nmsim", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.nmsim.de", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular dynamics simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}, {"term": "Protein modelling (loops)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0481"}, {"term": "Protein modelling (side chains)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0480"}, {"term": "Molecular docking", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0478"}, {"term": "Protein flexibility and motion analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0244"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-11T19:06:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Webserver for modeling biologically relevant protein conformational changes.
