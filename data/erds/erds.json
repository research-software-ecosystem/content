Here, we introduce a new method, estimation by read depth with single-nucleotide variants (ERDS), and use various approaches to compare its performance to other methods. We found that for common CNVs and high-coverage genomes, ERDS performs as well as the best method currently available (Genome STRiP), whereas for rare CNVs and high-coverage genomes, ERDS performs better than any available method. Importantly, ERDS accommodates both unique and highly amplified regions of the genome and does so without requiring separate alignments for calling CNVs and other variants. These comparisons show that for genomes sequenced at high coverage, ERDS provides a computationally convenient method that calls CNVs as well as or better than any currently available method. \u00a9 2012 The American Society of Human Genetics.", "citationCount": 45, "authors": [{"name": "Zhu M."}, {"name": "Need A.C."}, {"name": "Han Y."}, {"name": "Ge D."}, {"name": "Maia J.M."}, {"name": "Zhu Q."}, {"name": "Heinzen E.L."}, {"name": "Cirulli E.T."}, {"name": "Pelak K."}, {"name": "He M."}, {"name": "Ruzzo E.K."}, {"name": "Gumbs C."}, {"name": "Singh A."}, {"name": "Feng S."}, {"name": "Shianna K.V."}, {"name": "Goldstein D.B."}], "date": "2012-09-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "American Journal of Human Genetics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "David B.Goldstein", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "d.goldstein@duke.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mingfu Zhu", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mingfu.zhu@duke.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:erds", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.utahresearch.org/mingfuzhu/erds/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Variant calling", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3227"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}, {"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "ERDS is a free, open-source software, designed for detection of copy number variants (CNVs) on human genomes from next generation sequence data.
