The SpaGE function takes as input i) two single cell datasets, spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq, ii) the number of principal vectors (PVs), and iii) the set of unmeasured genes in the spatial data for which predictions are obtained from the scRNA-seq (optional). The function returns back the predicted expression for these unmeasured genes across all spatial cells.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Single-cell technologies are emerging fast due to their ability to unravel the heterogeneity of biological systems. While scRNA-seq is a powerful tool that measures whole-transcriptome expression of single cells, it lacks their spatial localization. Novel spatial transcriptomics methods do retain cells spatial information but some methods can only measure tens to hundreds of transcripts. To resolve this discrepancy, we developed SpaGE, a method that integrates spatial and scRNA-seq datasets to predict whole-transcriptome expressions in their spatial configuration. Using five dataset-pairs, SpaGE outperformed previously published methods and showed scalability to large datasets. Moreover, SpaGE predicted new spatial gene patterns that are confirmed independently using in situ hybridization data from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas.",
