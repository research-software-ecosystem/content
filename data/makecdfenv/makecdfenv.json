We prepared an R Bioconductor compatible package to detect, characterize and remove such probes in Affymetrix 3'IVT and exon-based arrays on the basis of correlation of signal intensities from probes within probe sets.Results: Using completely mouse genomes we determined type 1 (false negatives) and type 2 (false positives) errors with high accuracy and we show that our method routinely outperforms previous methods. When detecting 76.2% of known SNP/indels in mouse expression data, we obtain at most 5.5% false positives. At the same level of false positives, best previous method detected 72.6%. We also show that probes with differing binding affinity both hinder differential expression detection and introduce artifacts in cancer-healthy tissue comparison.Conclusions: Detection and removal of such probes should be a routine step in Affymetrix data preprocessing. We prepared a user friendly R package, compatible with Bioconductor, that allows the filtering and improving of data from Affymetrix microarrays experiments. \u00a9 2012 Dannemann et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Dannemann M."}, {"name": "Lachmann M."}, {"name": "Lorenc A."}], "date": "2012-04-16T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "James W.
