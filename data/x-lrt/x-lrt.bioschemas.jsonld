This is a likelihood-based approach which can perform hypothesis testing as well as estimation of disease-related marker relative risks under a case-parent design. This test uses nuclear family with a single affected proband and allows additional siblings and missing parental genotypes. This program can test both single marker and haplotypes association.",
