Standard assumption of uniform read intensity would yield biased estimates when the read intensity is in fact non-uniform. The problem is that, without strong assumptions, the read intensity pattern is not identifiable from data observed in a single sample.Results: We develop a joint statistical model that accounts for non-uniform isoform-specific read distribution and gene isoform expression estimation. The main challenge is in dealing with the large number of isoform-specific read distributions, which potentially are as many as the number of splice variants in the genome. A statistical regularization via a smoothing penalty is imposed to control the estimation. Also, for identifiability reasons, the method uses information across samples from the same region. We develop a fast and robust computational procedure based on the iterated-weighted least-squares algorithm, and apply it to simulated data and two real RNA-Seq datasets with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction validation. Empirical tests show that our model performs better than existing methods in terms of increasing precision in isoform-level estimation.Availability and implementation: We have implemented our method in an R package called Sequgio as a pipeline for fast processing of RNA-Seq data.Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. \u00a9 2013 The Author.", "citationCount": 11, "authors": [{"name": "Suo C."}, {"name": "Calza S."}, {"name": "Salim A."}, {"name": "Pawitan Y."}], "date": "2014-02-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://github.com/Senbee", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sequgio", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["0.99.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://fafner.meb.ki.se/personal/yudpaw/?page_id=13", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Processing", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2409"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Algorithm to estimate isoforms expression from RNA-seq data based on a model that doesn\u2019t assume uniform distribution of count within transcripts.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/sequgio-0-99-0-pre-processing-of-rnaseq-data.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "sequgio", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:13:04Z", "name": "Sequgio", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://fafner.meb.ki.se/biostatwiki/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
