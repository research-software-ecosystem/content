Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Summary: Large resequencing projects require a significant amount of storage for raw sequences, as well as alignment files. Because the raw sequences are redundant once the alignment has been generated, it is possible to keep only the alignment files. We present BamHash, a checksum based method to ensure that the read pairs in FASTQ files match exactly the read pairs stored in BAM files, regardless of the ordering of reads. BamHash can be used to verify the integrity of the files stored and discover any discrepancies. Thus, BamHash can be used to determine if it is safe to delete the FASTQ files storing raw sequencing read after alignment, without the loss of data.
