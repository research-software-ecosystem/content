                "abstract": "© 2020, The Author(s).Recent advances in high-throughput genomic technologies have nurtured a growing demand for statistical tools to facilitate identification of molecular changes as potential prognostic biomarkers or drugable targets for personalized precision medicine. In this study, we developed a web-based interactive and user-friendly platform for high-dimensional analysis of molecular alterations in cancer (HDMAC) (https://ripsung26.shinyapps.io/rshiny/). On HDMAC, several penalized regression models that are suitable for high-dimensional data analysis, Ridge, Lasso and adaptive Lasso, are offered, with Cox regression for survival and logistic regression for binary outcomes. Choice of a first-step screening is provided to address the multiple-comparison issue that often arises with large-volume genomic data. Hazard ratio or estimated coefficient is provided with each selected gene so that a multivariate regression model may be built based on the genes selected. Cross validation is provided as the method to estimate the prediction power of each regression model. In addition, R codes are also provided to facilitate download of whole sets of molecular variables from TCGA. In this study, illustration of the use of HDMAC was made through a set of data on gene mutations and a set on mRNA expression from ovarian cancer patients and a set on mRNA expression from bladder cancer patient. From the analysis of each set of data, a list of candidate genes was obtained that might be associated with mutations or abnormal expression of genes in ovarian and bladder cancers. HDMAC offers a solution for rigorous and validation analysis of high-dimensional genomic data.",
