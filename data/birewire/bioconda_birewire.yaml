description: Fast functions for bipartite network rewiring through N consecutive switching
  steps (See References) and for the computation of the minimal number of switching
  steps to be performed in order to maximise the dissimilarity with respect to the
  original network. Includes functions for the analysis of the introduced randomness
  across the switching steps and several other routines to analyse the resulting networks
  and their natural projections. Extension to undirected networks and directed signed
  networks is also provided. Starting from version 1.9.7 a more precise bound (especially
  for small network) has been implemented. Starting from version 2.2.0 the analysis
  routine is more complete and a visual montioring of the underlying Markov Chain
  has been implemented. Starting from 3.6.0 the library can handle also matrices with
  NA (not for the directed signed graphs).
