The hazard function is described as the product of a baseline hazard function and a positive (exponential) function of possibly time-dependent fixed and random covariates. Stratified Cox, grouped data and Weibull models can be used. Random effects can be either log-gamma or normally distributed and can account for a pedigree structure. Variance parameters are estimated in a Bayesian context. It is possible to account for the correlated nature of two random effects either by specifying a known correlation coefficient or estimating it from the data. An R interface of the Survival Kit provides a user friendly way to run the software. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.", "citationCount": 26, "authors": [{"name": "Meszaros G."}, {"name": "Solkner J."}, {"name": "Ducrocq V."}], "date": "2013-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "johann.soelkner@boku.ac.at"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:survival_kit", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.nas.boku.ac.at/nuwi/the-survival-kit/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2020-01-19T17:47:47Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Survival analysis methods were first developed in the biomedical field, which generally involves smaller file sizes and lower levels of effects than agronomic applications.
