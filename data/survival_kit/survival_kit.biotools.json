    "description": "Survival analysis methods were first developed in the biomedical field, which generally involves smaller file sizes and lower levels of effects than agronomic applications. The relative theory of random effects in survival analysis (\"fragile\" models) is not as advanced as with linear models and no freeware is available to use such models. The survival kit analyses large populations with complex models.",

                "abstract": "The Survival Kit is a Fortran 90 Software intended for survival analysis using proportional hazards models and their extension to frailty models with a single response time. The hazard function is described as the product of a baseline hazard function and a positive (exponential) function of possibly time-dependent fixed and random covariates. Stratified Cox, grouped data and Weibull models can be used. Random effects can be either log-gamma or normally distributed and can account for a pedigree structure. Variance parameters are estimated in a Bayesian context. It is possible to account for the correlated nature of two random effects either by specifying a known correlation coefficient or estimating it from the data. An R interface of the Survival Kit provides a user friendly way to run the software. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",
