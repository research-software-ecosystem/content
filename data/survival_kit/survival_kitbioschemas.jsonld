  "sc:description": "Survival analysis methods were first developed in the biomedical field, which generally involves smaller file sizes and lower levels of effects than agronomic applications. The relative theory of random effects in survival analysis (\"fragile\" models) is not as advanced as with linear models and no freeware is available to use such models. The survival kit analyses large populations with complex models.",
