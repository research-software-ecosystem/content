The TIGR Gene Indices (http:// www.tigr.org/tdb/tgi.shtml) are a collection of species-specific databases that use a highly refined protocol to analyze EST sequences in an attempt to identify the genes represented by that data and to provide additional information regarding those genes. Gene Indices are constructed by first clustering, then assembling EST and annotated gene sequences from GenBank for the targeted species. This process produces a set of unique, high-fidelity virtual transcripts, or Tentative Consensus (TC) sequences.
