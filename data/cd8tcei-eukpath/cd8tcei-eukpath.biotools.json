                "abstract": "Computational prediction to screen potential vaccine candidates has been proven to be a reliable way to provide guarantees for vaccine discovery in infectious diseases. As an important class of organisms causing infectious diseases, pathogenic eukaryotes (such as parasitic protozoans) have evolved the ability to colonize a wide range of hosts, including humans and animals; meanwhile, protective vaccines are urgently needed. Inspired by the immunological idea that pathogen-derived epitopes are able to mediate the CD8+ T-cell-related host adaptive immune response and with the available positive and negative CD8+ T-cell epitopes (TCEs), we proposed a novel predictor called CD8TCEI-EukPath to detect CD8+ TCEs of eukaryotic pathogens. Our method integrated multiple amino acid sequence-based hybrid features, employed a well-established feature selection technique, and eventually built an efficient machine learning classifier to differentiate CD8+ TCEs from non-CD8+ TCEs. Based on the feature selection results, 520 optimal hybrid features were used for modeling by utilizing the LightGBM algorithm. CD8TCEI-EukPath achieved impressive performance, with an accuracy of 79.255% in ten-fold cross-validation and an accuracy of 78.169% in the independent test. Collectively, CD8TCEI-EukPath will contribute to rapidly screening epitope-based vaccine candidates, particularly from large peptide-coding datasets. To conduct the prediction of CD8+ TCEs conveniently, an online web server is freely accessible (http://lab.malab.cn/∼hrs/CD8TCEI-EukPath/).",
