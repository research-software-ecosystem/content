We examine the prospective score test of Schaid et al. ([2002] Am. J. Hum. Genet 70:425-434), a novel modification of the prospective estimating equations of Zhao et al. ([2003] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 72:1231-1250) and the retrospective likelihood of Epstein and Satten ([2003] Am. J. Hum. Genet. 73:1316-1329). We find that all three approaches are roughly comparable when the haplotype effect on disease odds follows a multiplicative model. However, for dominant and recessive models of haplotype effect, the retrospective-likelihood method has increased efficiency with respect to the prospective methods. As all three methods assume haplotype frequencies are in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), we compare the robustness of each procedure to departures from HWE. We find the prospective methods are robust to departure from HWE, while the retrospective-likelihood method is biased for dominant and recessive models of haplotype effect. To remedy this limitation of the retrospective-likelihood method, we propose a modification that allows for a non-negative fixation index (common to all haplotype pairs) and show it dramatically reduces the bias of the retrospective likelihood when HWE is violated.", "citationCount": 68, "authors": [{"name": "Satten G.A."}, {"name": "Epstein M.P."}], "date": "2004-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genetic Epidemiology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://genetics.web.emory.edu/labs/epstein/software/index.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:chaplin", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.2.3"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://genetics.emory.edu/labs/epstein/software/chaplin/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Haplotype inference", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0487"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Chaplin (Case-control haplotype inference package.) is a software program for identifying specific haplotypes or haplotype features that are associated with disease using genotype data from a case-control study.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Fortran"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/chaplin-1-2-3-case-control-haplotype-inference-package.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "chaplin", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:05:08Z", "name": "Chaplin", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
