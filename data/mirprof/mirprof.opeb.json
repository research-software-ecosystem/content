Advances in next generation sequencing technologies are producing increasingly large numbers of sRNA reads per sample at a fraction of the cost of previous methods. However, many bioinformatics tools do not scale accordingly, are cumbersome, or require extensive support from bioinformatics experts. Therefore, researchers need user-friendly, robust tools, capable of not only processing large sRNA datasets in a reasonable time frame but also presenting the results in an intuitive fashion and visualizing sRNA genomic features. Herein, we present the UEA sRNA workbench, a suite of tools that is a successor to the web-based UEA sRNA Toolkit, but in downloadable format and with several enhanced and additional features.","authors":["Stocks M.B.","Moxon S.","Mapleson D.","Woolfenden H.C.","Mohorianu I.","Folkes L.","Schwach F.","Dalmay T.","Moulton V."],"cit_count":160,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bts311","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"The UEA sRNA workbench: A suite of tools for analysing and visualizing next generation sequencing microRNA and small RNA datasets","type":"Primary","year":"2012-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mirprof","biotoolsID":"mirprof","description":"Determines normalised expression levels of sRNAs matching known miRNAs in miRBase.","homepage":"http://srna-workbench.cmp.uea.ac.uk/mirprof/","name":"MiRProf"}}
