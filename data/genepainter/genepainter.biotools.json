This version of GenePainter facilitates working with large datasets through options to select specific subsets for analysis and visualization, and through providing exhaustive statistics. GenePainter' s application in phylogenetic analyses is considerably extended by the newly implemented integration of the exon-intron pattern conservation with phylogenetic trees. Availability and implementation: The software along with detailed documentation is available at http://www.motorprotein.de/genepainter and as Supplementary Material.",
