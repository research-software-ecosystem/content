Summary: Conserved intron positions in eukaryotic genes can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, to resolve ambiguous subfamily relationships in protein families and to infer the history of gene families. This version of GenePainter facilitates working with large datasets through options to select specific subsets for analysis and visualization, and through providing exhaustive statistics. GenePainter' s application in phylogenetic analyses is considerably extended by the newly implemented integration of the exon-intron pattern conservation with phylogenetic trees. Availability and implementation: The software along with detailed documentation is available at http://www.motorprotein.de/genepainter and as Supplementary Material.","authors":["Muhlhausen S.","Hellkamp M.","Kollmar M."],"cit_count":6,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25434742","title":"GenePainter v. 2.0 resolves the taxonomic distribution of intron positions","year":"2015-04-15"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:genepainter","biotoolsID":"genepainter","description":"Standalone tool for mapping gene structures onto protein multiple sequence alignments (MSA).
