Analysis is performed using a recently introduced coarse-grained computational approach that is applied to the majority of structures present in the electron microscopy data bank (EMDB). Results include equilibrium thermal fluctuations and elastic strain energy distributions that identify rigid versus flexible protein domains generally, as well as those associated with specific functional transitions, and correlations in molecular motions that identify molecular regions that are highly coupled dynamically, with implications for allosteric mechanisms. A practical web-based search interface enables users to easily collect conformational dynamics data in various formats. The data bank is maintained and updated automatically to include conformational dynamics results for new structural entries as they become available in the EMDB. The CDDB complements static structural information to facilitate the investigation and interpretation of the biological function of proteins and protein assemblies essential to cell function. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 10, "authors": [{"name": "Kim D.-N."}, {"name": "Altschuler J."}, {"name": "Strong C."}, {"name": "McGill G."}, {"name": "Bathe M."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mark Bathe", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "mark.bathe@mit.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:cddb", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.cdyn.org", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein molecular weight calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0398"}, {"term": "Molecular dynamics", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}, {"term": "Sequence assembly", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0310"}, {"term": "Protein flexibility and motion analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0244"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Database for comprehensive results on the conformational dynamics of high molecular weight proteins and protein assemblies.
