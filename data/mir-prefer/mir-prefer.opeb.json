These existing tools have at least one of the following problems: (i) high false-positive rate; (ii) long running time; (iii) work only for genomes in their databases; (iv) hard to install or use. We developed miR-PREFeR (miRNA PREdiction From small RNA-Seq data), which uses expression patterns of miRNA and follows the criteria for plant microRNA annotation to accurately predict plant miRNAs from one or more small RNA-Seq data samples of the same species. We tested miR-PREFeR on several plant species. The results show that miR-PREFeR is sensitive, accurate, fast and has low-memory footprint.","authors":["Lei J.","Sun Y."],"cit_count":29,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"24930140","title":"MiR-PREFeR: An accurate, fast and easy-to-use plant miRNA prediction tool using small RNA-Seq data","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mir-prefer","biotoolsID":"mir-prefer","description":"Uses expression patterns of miRNA and follows the criteria for plant microRNA annotation to accurately predict plant miRNAs from one or more small RNA-Seq data samples of the same species.","homepage":"http://www.cse.msu.edu/~leijikai/mir-prefer/","name":"miR-PREFeR"}}
