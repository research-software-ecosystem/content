    "description": "3575 Assessing Research Activity and Capacity of Community Based Organizations.\n\nOBJECTIVES SPECIFIC AIMS: 1. To assess the acceptability and feasibility and of an online self-assessment version of the Community REsearch Activity Assessment Tool (CREAT), an instrument to measure research capacity of CBOs. 2. To elicit CBO perspectives on their research and knowledge generation activities. METHODS STUDY POPULATION: Thirteen CBOs who had previously partnered with an academic course on practice-based community health research were contacted and asked to participate in the field testing of the CREAT and provide feedback on areas of strength and areas for potential improvement. Eleven organizations completed the field testing, which began and ended with an in-person semi-structured interview with the online self-administration of the CREAT in the middle.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
