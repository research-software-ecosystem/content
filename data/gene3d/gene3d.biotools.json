                "abstract": "The Gene3D structural domain database provides domain annotations for 7 million proteins, based on the manually curated structural domain superfamilies in CATH. These annotations are integrated with functional, genomic and molecular information from external resources, such as GO, EC, UniProt and the NCBI Taxonomy database. We have constructed a set of web services that provide programmatic access to this integrated database, as well as the Gene3D domain recognition tool (Gene3DScan) and protein sequence annotation pipeline for analysing novel protein sequences. Example queries include retrieving all curated GO terms for a domain superfamily or all the multi-domain architectures for the human genome. The services can be accessed using simple HTTP calls and are able to return results in a range of formats for quick downloading and easy parsing, graphical rendering and data storage. Hence, they provide a simple, but flexible means of integrating domain annotations and associated data sets into locally run pipelines and analysis software. The services can be found at http://gene3d.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/WebServices/. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).",
