            "abstract": "Although secondary structure predictions of an individual RNA sequence have been widely used in a number of sequence analyses of RNAs, accuracy is still limited. Recently, we proposed a method (called 'CentroidHomfold'), which includes information about homologous sequences into the prediction of the secondary structure of the target sequence, and showed that it substantially improved the performance of secondary structure predictions. CentroidHomfold, however, forces users to prepare homologous sequences of the target sequence. We have developed a Web application (CentroidHomfold-LAST) that predicts the secondary structure of the target sequence using automatically collected homologous sequences. LAST, which is a fast and sensitive local aligner, and CentroidHomfold are employed in the Web application. Computational experiments with a commonly-used data set indicated that CentroidHomfold-LAST substantially outperformed conventional secondary structure predictions including CentroidFold and RNAfold. © 2011 The Author(s).",
