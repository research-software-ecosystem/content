All rights reserved.Motivation: The identification of the functional variants responsible for observed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) signals is one of the most challenging tasks of the post-GWAS research era. Several tools have been developed to annotate genetic variants by their genomic location and potential functional implications. Each of these tools has its own requirements and internal logic, which forces the user to become acquainted with each interface. Results: From an awareness of the amount of work needed to analyze a single locus, we have built a flexible, versatile and easy-to-use web interface designed to help in prioritizing variants and predicting their potential functional implications. This interface acts as a single-point of entry linking association results with reference tools and relevant experiments.",
