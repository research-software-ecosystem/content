summary: framework for genomic biology
description: >
   PyCogent is a software library for genomic biology. It is a fully
   integrated and thoroughly tested framework for:
    * controlling third-party applications,
    * devising workflows; querying databases,
    * conducting novel probabilistic analyses of biological sequence
      evolution, and
    * generating publication quality graphics.
   It is distinguished by many unique built-in capabilities (such as true codon
   alignment) and the frequent addition of entirely new methods for the analysis
   of genomic data.
version: 1.9
