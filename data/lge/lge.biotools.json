    "description": "Scar shape analysis and simulated electrical instabilities in a non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy patient cohort.\n\nAn automated script for extracting the scar area, entropy, components, transmurality, radiality and interface length from short axis late gadolinium enhanced cardiac MRI images in nifti format.\n\nThis repository provides a script that creates a list of metrics quantifying a scar pattern seen in a cardiac short axis late gadolinium enhanced MRI image. The metrics provided are.\n\narea - The total area of the scar.\n\nradiality - The angular extent of the LGE pattern, with values between 0 and 1. A score of 1 indicates that scars are present in a full 360 degree pattern with respect to the centre of the blood pool, wheras 0 indicates no angular extent of scar.",

                "abstract": "© 2019 Balaban et al.This paper presents a morphological analysis of fibrotic scarring in non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, and its relationship to electrical instabilities which underlie reentrant arrhythmias. Two dimensional electrophysiological simulation models were constructed from a set of 699 late gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance images originating from 157 patients. Areas of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in each image were assigned one of 10 possible microstructures, which modelled the details of fibrotic scarring an order of magnitude below the MRI scan resolution. A simulated programmed electrical stimulation protocol tested each model for the possibility of generating either a transmural block or a transmural reentry. The outcomes of the simulations were compared against morphological LGE features extracted from the images. Models which blocked or reentered, grouped by microstructure, were significantly different from one another in myocardial-LGE interface length, number of components and entropy, but not in relative area and transmurality. With an unknown microstructure, transmurality alone was the best predictor of block, whereas a combination of interface length, transmurality and number of components was the best predictor of reentry in linear discriminant analysis.",
