The metrics provided are.\n\narea - The total area of the scar.\n\nradiality - The angular extent of the LGE pattern, with values between 0 and 1. A score of 1 indicates that scars are present in a full 360 degree pattern with respect to the centre of the blood pool, wheras 0 indicates no angular extent of scar.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'reentry', 'transmurality', 'non-ischemic', 'fibrotic'","homepage":"https://github.com/GabrielBalabanResearch/lgemri_scar_metrics","name":"LGE"}}
