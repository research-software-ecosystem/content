      "sc:description": "Plant-mSubP is a computational framework for the prediction of single- and multi-target protein subcellular localization using integrated machine-learning approaches.\n\nThe subcellular localization of proteins is very important for characterizing its function in a cell. Accurate prediction of the subcellular locations in computational paradigm has been an active area of interest. Most of the work has been focused on single localization prediction. Only few studies have discussed the multi-target localization, but have not achieved good accuracy so far; in plant sciences, very limited work has been done. Here we report the development of a novel tool Plant-mSubP, which is based on integrated machine learning approaches to efficiently predict the subcellular localizations in plant proteomes. The proposed approach predicts with high accuracy 11 single localizations and three dual locations of plant cell",
