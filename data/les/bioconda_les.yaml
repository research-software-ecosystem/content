description: The 'les' package estimates Loci of Enhanced Significance (LES) in tiling
  microarray data. These are regions of regulation such as found in differential transcription,
  CHiP-chip, or DNA modification analysis. The package provides a universal framework
  suitable for identifying differential effects in tiling microarray data sets, and
  is independent of the underlying statistics at the level of single probes.
