The authors examine the use of mind mapping technology to organize personal disaster preparedness information and explore the potential of mind mapping software as a tool to create individual and family preparedness resources. DESIGN: The general features of mind maps are considered and a sample family preparedness plan was created using TheBrain, a mind mapping software. RESULTS: Mind maps are a promising tool to organize personal preparedness plans with the ability to include significant amounts of varied information in a structure that emphasizes relationships between topics and enables collaborative sharing.",
