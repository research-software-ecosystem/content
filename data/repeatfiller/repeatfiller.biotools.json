    "description": "RepeatFiller incorporates newly-detected repeat-overlapping alignments into pairwise alignment chains. It only aligns local genomic regions that are bounded by colinear aligning blocks, as provided in the chains, which makes it feasible to consider all seeds including those that overlap repetitive regions.",
