The Ketcher editor, available as an Open Source software package for drawing chemical structures, has been expanded to include several features that allow storage, management and application of templates, as well as the use of symbols for a planning and processing of solid phase synthesis. In addition, tools for the drawing of coordinative bonds to represent e.g. organometallic compounds were added. The editor has been implemented into an Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) application which enables the use of the Ketcher editor for advanced operations in chemistry research. The developments of the ELN-integrated Ketcher (ketcher-rails) support the retrieval of identifiers and structure-related information from external databases and the molecule-based calculation of analytical values. The reworked editor can be used to generate molecular structures in reaction templates and to generate syntheses plans.","authors":["Kotov S.","Tremouilhac P.","Jung N.","Brase S."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1186/s13321-018-0292-9","journal":"Journal of Cheminformatics","title":"Chemotion-ELN part 2: adaption of an embedded Ketcher editor to advanced research applications","year":"2018-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ketcher-rails","biotoolsID":"ketcher-rails","description":"Provides the possibility to use Ketcher v1. editor with Rails and contains server actions implementations.","homepage":"https://github.com/ComPlat/ketcher-rails","name":"ketcher-rails"}}
