  "sc:description": "Accurate and Efficient Cell Lineage Tree Inference from Noisy Single Cell Data | Cell tree inference and genotype calling from noisy single cell data | ScisTree is a computer program for inferring cell tree and calling genotypes from uncertain single cell genotype data. If you use ScisTree, please cite: | The key feature of ScisTree is that it works with uncertain genotypes with individualized probability. That is, you can specify for each genotype (at a row/cell or column/site) different probabilities of being a particular genotype state. ScisTree allows both binary or ternary genotypes. Here is an example for binary genotypes. Note: don't include blank rows in the input genotype file",
