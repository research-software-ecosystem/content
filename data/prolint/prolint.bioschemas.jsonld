      "sc:description": "ProLint is a user-friendly framework for the automated analysis and interactive visualization of Protein-Lipid interactions. The time requirement to analyze and interpret data generated through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations usually exceeds the time to set up and perform the simulations. Add to this the continuing trend of increased system sizes, simulated for longer time scales and the need for a much larger set of proteins, it becomes clear how analysis and visualization of lipid-protein interactions can become a significant bottleneck. ProLint aimes to bridge this widening gap between data generation and gaining insight on biologically-relevant interactions between.\nprolintpy is a lightweight python library that is used by the ProLint webserver on the backend to analyze Protein-Lipid interactions.. Use this tool if you want to customize analysis and visualization of lipid-protein interactions and want to scale-up your workflow beyond the capabilities of the ProLint webserver.",
