Recent studies demonstrate the feasibility of detecting structural variation using next-generation, short-insert, paired-end sequencing reads. However, the utility of these reads is not entirely clear, nor are the analysis methods with which accurate detection can be achieved. The algorithm BreakDancer predicts a wide variety of structural variants including insertion-deletions (indels), inversions and translocations. We examined BreakDancer's performance in simulation, in comparison with other methods and in analyses of a sample from an individual with acute myeloid leukemia and of samples from the 1,000 Genomes trio individuals. BreakDancer sensitively and accurately detected indels ranging from 10 base pairs to 1 megabase pair that are difficult to detect via a single conventional approach.", "citationCount": 744, "authors": [{"name": "Chen K."}, {"name": "Wallis J.W."}, {"name": "McLellan M.D."}, {"name": "Larson D.E."}, {"name": "Kalicki J.M."}, {"name": "Pohl C.S."}, {"name": "McGrath S.D."}, {"name": "Wendl M.C."}, {"name": "Zhang Q."}, {"name": "Locke D.P."}, {"name": "Shi X."}, {"name": "Fulton R.S."}, {"name": "Ley T.J."}, {"name": "Wilson R.K."}, {"name": "Ding L."}, {"name": "Mardis E.R."}], "date": "2009-08-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Methods"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "K.
