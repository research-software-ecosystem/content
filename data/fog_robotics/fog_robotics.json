    "description": "A Function-as-a-Service Based Fog Robotic System for Cognitive Robots.\n\n\"Fog Robotics is a branch of networked robots that distributes storage, compute and networking resources between the Cloud and the Edge in a federated manner\u201d.\n\nFog Robotics enable robots and IoT devices in homes and warehouses to leverage upon nearby Edge resources as well as distant Cloud data centers. Administrative boundaries of resource ownership restrict control of data within domains of trust. The term `Cloud Robotics' indicates the use of network resources at the center of the network (or `Cloud'), while `Fog Robotics' involves the use of networked resources along the Cloud/Edge continuum (or `Fog').\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'cloud', 'fog', 'fog robot', 'robot'",
