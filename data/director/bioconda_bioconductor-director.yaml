about:
  description: Director is an R package designed to streamline the visualization of
    molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R package htmltools
    and a modified Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and
    easy, browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream
    effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules. The diagrams are robust,
    interactive, and packaged as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need
    for third-party software to view. This enables a straightforward approach for
    scientists to interpret the data produced, and bioinformatics developers an alternative
    means to present relevant data.
