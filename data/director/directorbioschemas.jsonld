It utilizes the R package htmltools and a modified Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy, browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules. The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party software to view.",
