description: Director is an R package designed to streamline the visualization of
  molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R package htmltools and
  a modified Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy,
  browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream effects
  of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules. The diagrams are robust, interactive,
  and packaged as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party
  software to view. This enables a straightforward approach for scientists to interpret
  the data produced, and bioinformatics developers an alternative means to present
  relevant data.
