Utilization of prior knowledge by application of computer-aided drug discovery approaches reduces time & financial expenses and increases the chances of positive results in anti-HIV R&D. To provide the scientific community with a tool that allows estimating of potential agents for treatment of HIV-infection and its comorbidities, we have created a freely-available web-resource for prediction of relevant biological activities based on the structural formulae of drug-like molecules","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31418763","name":"AntiHIV-Pred"}}
