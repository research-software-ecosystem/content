description: "DSSP is an application you use to assign the secondary structure of\
  \ a protein based on its solved three dimensional (3D) structure. . This version\
  \ (2) of DSSP is a rewrite that produces the same output as the original DSSP, but\
  \ deals better with exceptions in PDB files and is much faster.\n"
