We present a novel algorithm (SATCHMO) that is designed to address this challenge. SATCHMO simultaneously constructs a tree and a set of multiple sequence alignments, one for each internal node of the tree. The alignment at a given node contains all sequences within its sub-tree, and predicts which positions in those sequences are alignable and which are not. Aligned regions therefore typically get shorter on a path from a leaf to the root as sequences diverge in structure. Current methods either regard all positions as alignable (e.g. ClustalW), or align only those positions believed to be homologous across all sequences (e.g. profile HMM methods); by contrast SATCHMO makes different predictions of alignable regions in different subgroups. SATCHMO generates profile hidden Markov models at each node; these are used to determine branching order, to align sequences and to predict structurally alignable regions. Results: In experiments on the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database, SATCHMO is shown to perform comparably to ClustalW and the UCSC SAM HMM software. Results using SATCHMO to identify protein domains are demonstrated on potassium channels, with implications for the mechanism by which tumor necrosis factor alpha affects potassium current.", "citationCount": 81, "authors": [{"name": "Edgar R.C."}, {"name": "Sjolander K."}], "date": "2003-07-22T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": "9783222", "type": null, "pmcid": null, "metadata": {"title": "Phylogenetic inference in protein superfamilies: analysis of SH2 domains.", "abstract": "This work focuses on the inference of evolutionary relationships in protein superfamilies, and the uses of these relationships to identify key positions in the structure, to infer attributes on the basis of evolutionary distance, and to identify potential errors in sequence annotations. Relative entropy, a distance metric from information theory, is used in combination with Dirichlet mixture priors to estimate a phylogenetic tree for a set of proteins. This method infers key structural or functional positions in the molecule, and guides the tree topology to preserve these important positions within subtrees. Minimum-description-length principles are used to determine a cut of the tree into subtrees, to identify the subfamilies in the data. This method is demonstrated on SH2-domain containing proteins, resulting in a new subfamily assignment for Src2-drome and a suggested evolutionary relationship between Nck_human and Drk_drome, Sem5_caeel, Grb2_human and Grb2_chick.", "citationCount": 59, "authors": [{"name": "Sjolander K."}], "date": "1998-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proceedings / ...
