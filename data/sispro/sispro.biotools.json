                "abstract": "Spatial proteomics aims for a global description of organelle-specific protein distribution and dynamics, which is essential for understanding the molecular functions and cellular processes in health and disease. However, the application of this technique is seriously restricted by the neglect of robustness among proteomic signatures identified using standard statistical frameworks. Moreover, it is still a major bottleneck to automatically interpretate the identified proteomic signatures due to lack of integration of subcellular information. Herein, an online-tool SISPRO was constructed to (a) identify proteomic signatures with good robustness and accuracy via collectively evaluating relative weighted consistency (CWrel) & area under the curve (AUC) and (b) interpretate the identified signature based on comprehensive subcellular information from 9 organelles and 22 subcellular structures. All in all, SISPRO provides the endeavor to realize the simultaneous improvement of robustness and accuracy in signature identification and the unique capacity in biological annotation lies in its wide coverage of proteins and comprehensive spatial information. SISPRO is expected to be critical in spatial proteomic studies, which can be freely accessed without any login requirement at https://idrblab.org/sispro/",
