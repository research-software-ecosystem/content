However, automatic methods that can predict the effects of mutations will allow a reduced set of mutations to be studied. Site Directed Mutator (SDM) is a statistical potential energy function that uses environment-specific amino-acid substitution frequencies within homologous protein families to calculate a stability score, which is analogous to the free energy difference between the wild-type and mutant protein. Here, we present a web server for SDM (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/\u223csdm/sdm.php), which has obtained more than 10000 submissions since being online in April 2008. To run SDM, users must upload a wild-type structure and the position and amino acid type of the mutation. The results returned include information about the local structural environment of the wild-type and mutant residues, a stability score prediction and prediction of disease association. Additionally, the wild-type and mutant structures are displayed in a Jmol applet with the relevant residues highlighted. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 203, "authors": [{"name": "Worth C.L."}, {"name": "Preissner R."}, {"name": "Blundell T.L."}], "date": "2011-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "ARUN PRASAD PANDURANGAN", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "apandura@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sdm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~sdm/sdm.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein model validation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0321"}, {"term": "Protein modelling (mutation)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0331"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}, {"term": "Protein function prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_1777"}, {"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Site Directed Mutator (SDM) is a web server for predicting effects of mutations on protein stability and function.
