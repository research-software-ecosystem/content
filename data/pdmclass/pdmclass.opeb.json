In this article, we propose a methodology using regularized regression models for the classification of tumors in microarray experiments. The performances of principal components, partial least squares, and ridge regression models are studied; these regression procedures are adapted to the classification setting using the optimal scoring algorithm. We also develop a procedure for ranking genes based on the fitted regression models. The proposed methodologies are applied to two microarray studies in cancer.","authors":["Ghosh D."],"cit_count":33,"doi":"10.1111/j.0006-341X.2003.00114.x","journal":"Biometrics","title":"Penalized Discriminant Methods for the Classification of Tumors from Gene Expression Data","type":"Other","year":"2003-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pdmclass","biotoolsID":"pdmclass","description":"This package can be used to classify microarray data using one of three penalized regression methods; partial least squares, principal components regression, or ridge regression.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pdmclass.html","name":"pdmclass","version":["1.46.0"]}}
