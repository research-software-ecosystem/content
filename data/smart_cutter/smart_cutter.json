    "description": "An Efficient Strategy for Increasing the Coverage of Chemical Cross-Linking Analysis.\n\nChemical cross-linking combined with mass spectrometry (CXMS) has emerged as a powerful tool to study protein structure, conformation, and protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Until now, most cross-linked peptides were generated by using commercial cross-linkers, such as DSS, BS3, and DSSO, which react with the primary amino groups of the lysine residues of proteins. However, trypsin, the most commonly used proteolytic enzyme, cannot cleave the C-terminus of a linked lysine, making the obtained cross-linked peptides longer than common peptides and unfavorable for MS identification and data searching.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'bacteriome'",
