Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThe purpose of this work was to establish the distribution of HLA-DPB1 alleles in Russians living in the Chelyabinsk region (Russia). DPB1 frequencies were determined in 100 unrelated Russian, living in the Chelyabinsk region. All subjects were healthy unrelated blood donors, between 18 and 55 years of age. Typing was performed by NGS (DNA-technology, Moscow). For population genetics analysis GENE[RATE] (https://hla-net.eu/tools/) software was used. DPB1*04:01 prevails in this population (gf = 0.3667). Other frequent HLA-DPB1 alleles were: DPB1*04:02, DPB1*02:01, DPB1*03:01 (gf = 0.1490; 0.1481; 0.1385, respectively). Rare alleles (gf \u2264 0.03) were DPB1*17:01, DPB1*01:01, DPB1*06:01, DPB1*14:01, DPB1*05:01, DPB1*13:01, DPB1*09:01, DPB1*10:01, DPB1*11:01, DPB1*23:01, DPB1*124:01, DPB1*15:01, DPB1*16:01, DPB1*105:01, DPB1*150:01.",
