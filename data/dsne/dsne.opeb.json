It plays a vital role in neuroimaging field because sometimes it is the only way to perform quality control of large dataset. There are many methods developed to perform this task but most of them rely on the assumption that all samples are locally available for the computation. Specifically, one needs access to all the samples in order to compute the distance directly between all pairs of points to measure the similarity. But all pairs of samples may not be available locally always from local sites for various reasons (e.g. privacy concerns for rare disease data, institutional or IRB policies).\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'COIL-20'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/826974","name":"dSNE"}}
