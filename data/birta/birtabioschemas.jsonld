  "sc:description": "Expression levels of mRNA molecules are regulated by different processes, comprising inhibition or activation by transcription factors and post-transcriptional degradation by microRNAs. The tool uses the regulatory networks of TFs and miRNAs together with mRNA and miRNA expression data to predict switches in regulatory activity between two conditions. A Bayesian network is used to model the regulatory structure and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo is applied to sample the activity states.",
