It's main features are:\n\n-Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step\n\n-Supports single-end read alignments\n\n-Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable\n\n-The output gives heatmap with categories.","homepage":"https://github.com/pradyumnasagar/TaBSAP","name":"TaBSAP","version":["1.0.0","1.0.1","1.0.2"]}}
