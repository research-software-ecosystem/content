  "sc:description": "Targeted Bisulfite Sequencing Analysis Pipeline\nA pipeline to analyze the data obtained from targeted bisulfite sequencing through the ion-torrent platform.\n\nTaBSAP is a pipeline to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a genome of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step and enables a researcher to analyze the methylation levels of their samples straight away. It's main features are:\n\n-Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step\n\n-Supports single-end read alignments\n\n-Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable\n\n-The output gives heatmap with categories.",
