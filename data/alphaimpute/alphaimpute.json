An algorithm that imputes alleles or allele probabilities for all animals in the pedigree and for all genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) provides a framework to combine all pedigree, genomic, and phenotypic information into a single-stage genomic evaluation. Methods: An algorithm was developed for imputation of genotypes in pedigreed populations that allows imputation for completely ungenotyped animals and for low-density genotyped animals, accommodates a wide variety of pedigree structures for genotyped animals, imputes unmapped SNP, and works for large datasets. The method involves simple phasing rules, long-range phasing and haplotype library imputation and segregation analysis. Results: Imputation accuracy was high and computational cost was feasible for datasets with pedigrees of up to 25 000 animals. The resulting single-stage genomic evaluation increased the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values compared to a scenario in which phenotypes on relatives that were not genotyped were ignored. Conclusions: The developed imputation algorithm and software and the resulting single-stage genomic evaluation method provide powerful new ways to exploit imputation and to obtain more accurate genetic evaluations. \u00a9 2012 Hickey et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 64, "authors": [{"name": "Hickey J.M."}, {"name": "Kinghorn B.P."}, {"name": "Tier B."}, {"name": "Van Der Werf J.H."}, {"name": "Cleveland M.A."}], "date": "2012-06-25T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genetics Selection Evolution"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "john.hickey@roslin.ed.ac.uk"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.alphagenes.roslin.ed.ac.uk/forums/forum/alphaimpute/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:alphaimpute", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://sites.google.com/site/hickeyjohn/alphaimpute", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Imputation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3557"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2020-01-19T17:47:47Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Impute and phase genotype data in populations with pedigree information available.
