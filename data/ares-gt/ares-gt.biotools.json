    "description": "ARES-GT is a python script that identify CRISPR targets in query sequences (in FASTA format) and can also identify CRISPR targets matching multiple genes. Several online CRISPR tools exists with very good performance, however only a set of availables genomes can be selected (in some cases only a few, though in some tools more than 1500 can be selected) but none of them can identify sequences to be able to target multiple genes. This work usually needs manual (an slow) evaluation of alignments and offtargets.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Guide RNA design for CRISPR genome editing of gene families is a challenging task as usually good candidate sgRNAs are tagged with low scores precisely because they match several locations in the genome, thus time-consuming manual evaluation of targets is required. To address this issues, I have developed ARES-GT, a Python local command line tool compatible with any operative system. ARES-GT allows the selection of candidate sgRNAs that match multiple input query sequences, in addition of candidate sgRNAs that specifically match each query sequence. It also contemplates the use of unmapped contigs apart from complete genomes thus allowing the use of any genome provided by user and being able to handle intraspecies allelic variability and individual polymorphisms. ARES-GT is available at GitHub (https://github.com/eugomin/ARES-GT.git).",
