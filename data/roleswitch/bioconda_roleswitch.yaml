description: 'Infer Probabilities of MiRNA-mRNA Interaction Signature (ProMISe) using
  paired expression data from a single sample. Roleswitch operates in two phases by
  inferring the probability of mRNA (miRNA) being the targets ("targets") of miRNA
  (mRNA), taking into account the expression of all of the mRNAs (miRNAs) due to their
  potential competition for the same miRNA (mRNA). Due to dynamic miRNA repression
  in the cell, Roleswitch assumes that the total transcribed mRNA levels are higher
  than the observed (equilibrium) mRNA levels and iteratively updates the total transcription
  of each mRNA targets based on the above inference. NB: in the paper, we used ProMISe
  as both the model name and inferred score name.'
