    "description": "A Protocol for Acquiring and Integrating MS3 Data to Improve In Silico Chemical Structure Elucidation for Metabolomics.\n\nStructure elucidation of metabolites (<1000 Da) in biofluids is extremely challenging due to the diversity and complexity of chemical structure space. Generally, due to lack of reference tandem mass data (MS2), in silico fragmenters are used to rank candidates acquired from chemical databases as a function on how well they explain an experimental collision-induced dissociation spectrum. However, multistage fragmentation data (i.e., MS3) have not been adequately utilized in current metabolomics structure elucidation pipelines. To address this shortcoming, here we describe an experimental (nontargeted direct infusion ion mobility-mass spectrometry-based) and computational workflow to acquire and utilize multistage mass (MS3) spectrometry data for database-assisted structure elucidation.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'MS3'",
