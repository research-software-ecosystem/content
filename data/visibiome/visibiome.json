This process facilitates the identification of similar compositional features in microbiota elsewhere and therefore can help to understand driving factors for microbial community assembly. Results: We present Visibiome, a microbiome search engine that can perform exhaustive, phylogeny based similarity search and contextualization of user-provided samples against a comprehensive dataset of 16S rRNA profiles environments, while tackling several computational challenges. In order to scale to high demands, we developed a distributed system that combines web framework technology, task queueing and scheduling, cloud computing and a dedicated database server. To further ensure speed and efficiency, we have deployed Nearest Neighbor search algorithms, capable of sublinear searches in high-dimensional metric spaces in combination with an optimized Earth Mover Distance based implementation of weighted UniFrac. The search also incorporates pairwise (adaptive) rarefaction and optionally, 16S rRNA copy number correction. The result of a query microbiome sample is the contextualization against a comprehensive database of microbiome samples from a diverse range of environments, visualized through a rich set of interactive figures and diagrams, including barchart-based compositional comparisons and ranking of the closest matches in the database. Conclusions: Visibiome is a convenient, scalable and efficient framework to search microbiomes against a comprehensive database of environmental samples. The search engine leverages a popular but computationally expensive, phylogeny based distance metric, while providing numerous advantages over the current state of the art tool.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Azman S.K."}, {"name": "Anwar M.Z."}, {"name": "Henschel A."}], "date": "2017-07-24T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Andreas Henschel", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ahenschel@masdar.ac.ae"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:visibiome", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://bitbucket.org/syaffers/visibiome.git", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Database search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2421"}, {"term": "Visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Microbiome search and visualization tool.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "visibiome", "additionDate": "2018-08-12T11:17:03Z", "name": "Visibiome", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://bitbucket.org/syaffers/visibiome.git", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
