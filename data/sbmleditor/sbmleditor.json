SBMLeditor tries to answer this need by providing a very simple, low level editor of SBML files. Users can create and remove all the necessary bits and pieces of SBML in a controlled way, that maintains the validity of the final SBML file. Results: SBMLeditor is written in JAVA using JCompneur, a library providing interfaces to easily display an XML document as a tree. This decreases dramatically the development time for a new XML editor. The possibility to include custom dialogs for different tags allows a lot of freedom for the editing and validation of the document. In addition to Xerces, SBMLeditor uses libSBML to check the validity and consistency of SBML files. A graphical equation editor allows an easy manipulation of MathML. SBMLeditor can be used as a module of the Systems Biology Workbench. Conclusion: SBMLeditor contains many improvements compared to a generic XML editor, and allow users to create an SBML model quickly and without syntactic errors. \u00a9 2007 Rodriguez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 25, "authors": [{"name": "Rodriguez N."}, {"name": "Donizelli M."}, {"name": "Le Novere N."}], "date": "2007-03-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sbmleditor", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.0-b1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/SBMLeditor.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Validation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2428"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "SBMLeditor is a portable (written in Java), low-level, tree-structured editor for SBML.
