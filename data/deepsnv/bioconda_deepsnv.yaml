description: This package provides provides quantitative variant callers for detecting
  subclonal mutations in ultra-deep (>=100x coverage) sequencing experiments. The
  deepSNV algorithm is used for a comparative setup with a control experiment of the
  same loci and uses a beta-binomial model and a likelihood ratio test to discriminate
  sequencing errors and subclonal SNVs. The shearwater algorithm computes a Bayes
  classifier based on a beta-binomial model for variant calling with multiple samples
  for precisely estimating model parameters - such as local error rates and dispersion
  - and prior knowledge, e.g. from variation data bases such as COSMIC.
