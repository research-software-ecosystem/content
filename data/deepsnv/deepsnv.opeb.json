Significance testing using the optimal discovery procedure and generalized likelihood ratio tests are implemented for general study designs. Special functions are available to facilitate the analysis of common study designs, including time course experiments. Other packages are integrated to provide a wide range of tools for gene expression analysis.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/deepSNV.html","name":"deepSNV","version":["1.20.0"]}}
