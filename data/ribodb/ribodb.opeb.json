Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution. All rights reserved. Ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) are increasingly used as an alternative to ribosomal rRNA for prokaryotic systematics. However, their routine use is difficult because r-proteins are often not or wrongly annotated in complete genome sequences, and there is currently no dedicated exhaustive database of r-proteins. RiboDB aims at fulfilling this gap. This weekly updated comprehensive database allows the fast and easy retrieval of r-protein sequences from publicly available complete prokaryotic genome sequences. The current version of RiboDB contains 90 r-proteins from 3,750 prokaryotic complete genomes encompassing 38 phyla/major classes and 1,759 different species. RiboDB is accessible at http://ribodb.univ-lyon1.fr and through ACNUC interfaces.","authors":["Jauffrit F.","Penel S.","Delmotte S.","Rey C.","De Vienne D.M.","Gouy M.","Charrier J.-P.","Flandrois J.-P.","Brochier-Armanet C."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1093/molbev/msw088","journal":"Molecular Biology and Evolution","pmid":"27189556","title":"RiboDB Database: A Comprehensive Resource for Prokaryotic Systematics","year":"2016-08-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ribodb","biotoolsID":"ribodb","description":"Fast and easy retrieval of r-protein sequences from publicly available complete prokaryotic genome sequences.","homepage":"https://ribodb.univ-lyon1.fr/ribodb/ribodb-in.cgi","name":"RiboDB","version":["1.0.2"]}}
