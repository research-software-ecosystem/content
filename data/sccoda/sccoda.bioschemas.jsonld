It also provides a framework for integration of results directly from scanpy and other sources.\n\nThis repository contains the code that was used to produce the results and plots for scCODA: A Bayesian model for compositional single-cell data analysis (Büttner and Ostner et al., 2020). The package containing the model can be found here.",
