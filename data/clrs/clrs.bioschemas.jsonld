      "sc:description": "Continual Learning Benchmark for Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification.\n\nThis is a database designed for the new task named Continual/Lifelong learning for remote sensing image scene classification. The existing remote sensing image scene classification datasets use static benchmarks and lack the standard to divide the datasets into several sequential learning training batches, which largely limits the development of Continual/Lifelong learning in remote sensing image scene classification.\n\nThe proposed CLRS data set consists of 15,000 remote sensing images divided into 25 scene classes, namely, airport, bare-land, beach, bridge, commercial, desert, farmland, forest, golf-course, highway, industrial, meadow, mountain, overpass, park, parking, playground, port, railway, railway-station, residential, river, runway, stadium, and storage-tank. Each class has 600 images, and the image size is 256x256. The resolution of the images ranges from 0.26 m to 8.85 m.",
