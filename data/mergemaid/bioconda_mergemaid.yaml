description: The functions in this R extension are intended for cross-study comparison
  of gene expression array data. Required from the user is gene expression matrices,
  their corresponding gene-id vectors and other useful information, and they could
  be 'list','matrix', or 'ExpressionSet'. The main function is 'mergeExprs' which
  transforms the input objects into data in the merged format, such that common genes
  in different datasets can be easily found. And the function 'intcor' calculate the
  correlation coefficients. Other functions use the output from 'modelOutcome' to
  graphically display the results and cross-validate associations of gene expression
  data with survival.
