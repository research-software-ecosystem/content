description: The main goal of this project is to create a reflection group on metazoan
  microRNAs (miRNAs), open to all interested researchers, to identify blockages and
  develop standards and guidelines to improve miRNA research, resources and communication.
  This can go through the use of standardized file formats, gene and variants nomenclature
  guidelines, and advancements in miRNA biology understanding. The group will eventually
  also aim at expanding its breadth to the development of novel tools, data resources,
  and best-practices guidelines to benefit the scientific community by providing high
  confidence validated research and analysis strategies, regardless the expertise
  in this field. This package provides the command line interface to mirtop.
