description: The package offers the R library GenABEL for the hunt of genetic contributions
  to a disease (or any other pheonypical trait) by so called genome-wide association
  analysis. Additional input commonly comes from DNA mircoarray experiments, performed
  on every individual, that determine differences (polymorphisms) in the population.
  GenABEL finds associations between quantitative or binary traits and single-nucleiotide
  polymorphisms (SNPs).
