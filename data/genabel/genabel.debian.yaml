description: "The package offers the R library GenABEL for the hunt of genetic contributions\
  \ to a disease (or any other pheonypical trait) by so called genome-wide association\
  \ analysis. Additional input commonly comes from DNA mircoarray experiments, performed\
  \ on every individual, that determine differences (polymorphisms) in the population.\
  \ GenABEL finds associations between quantitative or binary traits and single-nucleiotide\
  \ polymorphisms (SNPs).\n"
