summary: GNU R package for genome-wide SNP association analysis
description: >
  The package offers the R library GenABEL for the hunt of genetic contributions
  to a disease (or any other pheonypical trait) by so called genome-wide
  association analysis. Additional input commonly comes from DNA mircoarray
  experiments, performed on every individual, that determine differences
  (polymorphisms) in the population. GenABEL finds associations between
  quantitative or binary traits and single-nucleiotide polymorphisms
  (SNPs).
