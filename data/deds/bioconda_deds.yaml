description: This library contains functions that calculate various statistics of
  differential expression for microarray data, including t statistics, fold change,
  F statistics, SAM, moderated t and F statistics and B statistics. It also implements
  a new methodology called DEDS (Differential Expression via Distance Summary), which
  selects differentially expressed genes by integrating and summarizing a set of statistics
  using a weighted distance approach.
