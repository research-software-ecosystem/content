description: Genome wide studies of translational control is emerging as a tool to
  study verious biological conditions. The output from such analysis is both the mRNA
  level (e.g. cytosolic mRNA level) and the levl of mRNA actively involved in translation
  (the actively translating mRNA level) for each mRNA. The standard analysis of such
  data strives towards identifying differential translational between two or more
  sample classes - i.e. differences in actively translated mRNA levels that are independent
  of underlying differences in cytosolic mRNA levels. This package allows for such
  analysis using partial variances and the random variance model. As 10s of thousands
  of mRNAs are analyzed in parallell the library performs a number of tests to assure
  that the data set is suitable for such analysis.
