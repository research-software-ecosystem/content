Predicting out-of-hospital outcomes upon follow-up remains difficult, and no simple, well-validated tools exist for this population at present. We aim to evaluate several factors in a competing risks model for actionable evaluation of the incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events in diabetic outpatients following acute coronary syndrome. Methods: Retrospective analysis of consecutive patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome in two centres. A Fine–Gray competing risks model was adjusted to predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and all-cause mortality. A point-based score is presented that is based on this model. Results: Out of the 1400 patients, there were 783 (55.9%) with at least one major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (417 deaths). Of them, 143 deaths were due to non-major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Predictive Fine–Gray models show that the ‘PG-HACKER’ risk factors (gender, age, peripheral arterial disease, left ventricle function, previous congestive heart failure, Killip class and optimal medical therapy) were associated to major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Conclusion: The PG-HACKER score is a simple and effective tool that is freely available and easily accessible to physicians and patients. The PG-HACKER score can predict major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events following acute coronary syndrome in patients with diabetes.","authors":["Baluja A.","Rodriguez-Manero M.","Cordero A.","Kreidieh B.","Iglesias-Alvarez D.","Garcia-Acuna J.M.","Martinez-Gomez A.","Agra-Bermejo R.","Alvarez-Rodriguez L.","Abou-Jokh C.","Lopez-Raton M.","Gude-Sampedro F.","Alvarez-Escudero J.","Gonzalez-Juanatey J.R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1177/1479164119892137","journal":"Diabetes and Vascular Disease Research","pmid":"31841030","title":"Prediction of major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular events in patients with diabetes after acute coronary syndrome","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:PG-HACKER","biotoolsID":"PG-HACKER","description":"Prediction of major adverse cardiac, cerebrovascular events in patients with diabetes after acute coronary syndrome.\n\nMACCE cumulative incidence for Diabetic Patients post-ACS.\n\nPeripheral artery disease No Yes.\n\nKillip class I (no CHF) II (rales and/or JVD) III (pulmonary edema) IV (cardiogenic shock).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'adverse cardiac cerebrovascular', 'cardiac cerebrovascular', 'cerebrovascular'","homepage":"http://medicalc.github.io/pghacker","name":"PG-HACKER"}}
