description: Makes Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) data
  analysis as easy as possible by only requiring a small set of functions to perform
  an entire analysis. 'speaq' offers the possibility of raw spectra alignment and
  quantitation but also an analysis based on features whereby the spectra are converted
  to peaks which are then grouped and turned into features. These features can be
  processed with any number of statistical tools either included in 'speaq' or available
  elsewhere on CRAN.
