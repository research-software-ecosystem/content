      "sc:description": "Bayesian non-parametric survival regression for optimizing precision dosing of intravenous busulfan in allogeneic stem cell transplantation | Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is now part of standard of care for acute leukemia (AL). To reduce toxicity of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen, intravenous busulfan is usually used as a preparative regimen for AL patients undergoing allo-SCT. Systemic busulfan exposure, characterized by the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), is strongly associated with clinical outcome. An AUC that is too high is associated with severe toxicities, while an AUC that is too low carries increased risks of disease recurrence and failure to engraft. Consequently, an optimal AUC interval needs to be determined for therapeutic use",
