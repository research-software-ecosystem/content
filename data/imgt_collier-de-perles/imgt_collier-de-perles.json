Corresponding protein sequences were annotated with IMGT tools, which allow the precise identification of the genes expressed in these proteins, and the description of framework and complementarity determining regions according to the IMGT standardized nomenclature and IMGT unique numbering. Two-dimensional graphical representations of the V-DOMAINs, designated as Colliers de Perles, are automatically produced. A query Web interface allows interactive search of the IMGT/3D structure-DB data. In this article, IMGT gene identification and Colliers de Perles of human immunoglobulins with known 3D structures in the Protein Data Bank are presented.",

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) superfamily (MhcSF) comprises, in addition to the MHC, proteins which share the common feature of having Mhc-like domains. IMGT\u00ae the international ImMunoGeneTics information system\u00ae (http://imgt.cines.fr) has set up a unique numbering system and standardized 2D graphical representations, or IMGT Colliers de Perles, which take into account the structural features of the Ig-like and Mhc-like domains. In this article, we review the IMGT Scientific chart rules for the description of the IgSF (V and C types) and of the MhcSF (G type) domains. These rules are based on the IMGT-ONTOLOGY axioms and concepts and are applicable for the sequence and structure analysis, whatever the species, the IgSF or MhcSF protein, or the chain type. These IMGT Colliers de Perles are particularly useful for antibody engineering, sequence-structure analysis, visualization and comparison of positions for mutations, polymorphisms and contact analysis. \u00a9 Oxford University Press, 2008, All rights reserved.",

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (http://www.imgt.org) is the global reference in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. By its creation in 1989 by Marie-Paule Lefranc (Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier and CNRS), IMGT marked the advent of immunoinformatics, which emerged at the interface between immunogenetics and bioinformatics. IMGT is specialized in the immunoglobulins (IG) or antibodies, T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility (MH) and proteins of the IgSF and MhSF superfamilies. IMGT is built on the IMGTONTOLOGY axioms and concepts, which bridged the gap between genes, sequences and 3D structures. The concepts include the IMGTR standardized keywords (identification), IMGTR standardized labels (description), IMGTR standardized nomenclature (classification), IMGT unique numbering and IMGT Colliers de Perles (numerotation). IMGTR comprises 7 databases, 17 online tools and 15 000 pages of web resources, and provides a high-quality and integrated system for analysis of the genomic and expressed IG and TR repertoire of the adaptive immune responses, including NGS high-throughput data. Tools and databases are used in basic, veterinary and medical research, in clinical applications (mutation analysis in leukemia and lymphoma) and in antibody engineering and humanization. The IMGT/mAb-DB interface was developed for therapeutic antibodies and fusion proteins for immunological applications (FPIA). IMGTR is freely available at http://www.imgt.org.",
