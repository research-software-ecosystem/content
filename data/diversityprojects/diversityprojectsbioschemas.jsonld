It might be installed as part of a DWB environment, but also as a stand-alone application, e. g., in a local installation. Each DWB module is devoted to a specific data domain. DP is focused on the management of (research) projects,  data collections, processed by the other DWB modules. It is managing metadata , labels, descriptors, and descriptions of projects, including data package-specific settings for a metadata standard-compliant publication. DP is organising the storage of (legal) documents, permits, information on publications  and multimedia resources. DP is handling roles of persons and organisations involved in collection and research projects. The tool is organising project classification and hierarchy in relation to sister and umbrella projects as well as the storage of each type of stable identifier related to data packages. DP is managing issues on web presentation of data collections.",
