All rights reserved. Single-cell trajectories can unveil how gene regulation governs cell fate decisions. However, learning the structure of complex trajectories with multiple branches remains a challenging computational problem. We present Monocle 2, an algorithm that uses reversed graph embedding to describe multiple fate decisions in a fully unsupervised manner. We applied Monocle 2 to two studies of blood development and found that mutations in the genes encoding key lineage transcription factors divert cells to alternative fates.","authors":["Qiu X.","Mao Q.","Tang Y.","Wang L.","Chawla R.","Pliner H.A.","Trapnell C."],"cit_count":90,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.4402","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Reversed graph embedding resolves complex single-cell trajectories","type":"Primary","year":"2017-10-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:monocle","biotoolsID":"monocle","description":"This tool performs differential expression and time-series analysis for single-cell expression experiments. It orders individual cells according to progress through a biological process, without knowing ahead of time which genes define progress through that process. It also performs differential expression analysis, clustering, visualization, and other useful tasks on single cell expression data. It is designed to work with RNA-Seq and qPCR data, but could be used with other types as well.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/monocle.html","name":"monocle","version":["2.2.0"]}}
