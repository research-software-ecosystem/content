description: Monocle performs differential expression and time-series analysis for
  single-cell expression experiments. It orders individual cells according to progress
  through a biological process, without knowing ahead of time which genes define progress
  through that process. Monocle also performs differential expression analysis, clustering,
  visualization, and other useful tasks on single cell expression data.  It is designed
  to work with RNA-Seq and qPCR data, but could be used with other types as well.
