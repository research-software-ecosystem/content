description: A differential abundance analysis for the comparison of two or more conditions.
  Useful for analyzing data from standard RNA-seq or meta-RNA-seq assays as well as
  selected and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a Dirichlet-multinomial
  model to infer abundance from counts, optimized for three or more experimental replicates.
  The method infers biological and sampling variation to calculate the expected false
  discovery rate, given the variation, based on a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test and Welch's
  t-test (via aldex.ttest), a Kruskal-Wallis test (via aldex.kw), a generalized linear
  model (via aldex.glm), or a correlation test (via aldex.corr). All tests report
  p-values and Benjamini-Hochberg corrected p-values.
