                "abstract": "Plant breeders are interested in the analysis of phenotypic data to measure genetic effects and heritability of quantitative traits and predict gain from selection. Measurement of phenotypic values of 6 related generations (parents, F1, F2, and backcrosses) allows for the simultaneous analysis of both Mendelian and quantitative traits. In 1997, Liu et al. released a SAS software based program (SASGENE) for the analysis of inheritance and linkage of qualitative traits. We have developed a new program (SASQuant) that estimates gene effects (Hayman's model), genetic variances, heritability, predicted gain from selection (Wright's and Warner's models), and number of effective factors (Wright's, Mather's, and Lande's models). SASQuant makes use of traditional genetic models and allows for their easy application to complex data sets. SASQuant is freely available and is intended for scientists studying quantitative traits in plant populations. © The American Genetic Association. 2007. All rights reserved.",
