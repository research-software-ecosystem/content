We demonstrate our approach using simulated data and discuss its performance under varying conditions.Availability: PurBayes is implemented as an R package, and source code is available for download through CRAN at http://cran.r-project.org/package=PurBayes.Contact: Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available online at Bioinformatics online. © 2013 The Author 2013.
