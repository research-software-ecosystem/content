Using data from public CRISPR/Cas9-based screening experiments, we found that the sequences of gRNAs in the library influence CRISPR/Cas9-based screening. As building a standard strategy for correcting results of all gRNA libraries is impractical, we developed SeqCor, an open-source programming bundle that enables researchers to address the result bias potentially triggered by the composition of gRNA sequences via the organization of gRNA in the library used in CRISPR/Cas9-based screening. Furthermore, SeqCor completely computerizes the extraction of sequence features that may influence single-guide RNA knockout efficiency using a machine learning approach. Taken together, we have developed a software program bundle that ought to be beneficial to the CRISPR/Cas9-based screening platform.",
