  "sc:description": "It evaluates the quality of protein structures. It integrates analyses from several widely-used structure quality evaluation tools. It provides standard constraint analyses, statistics on the PDB validation goodness-of-fit between structures and experimental data, and knowledge-based structure quality scores in standardized format suitable for database integration. Global quality measures are reported as Z scores, based on calibration with a set of high-resolution X-ray crystal structures.",
