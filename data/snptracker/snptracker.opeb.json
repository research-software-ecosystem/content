The reference single nucleotide polymorphism (rs) ID in dbSNP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ SNP/) is a key resource identifier, which is widely used in human genetics and genomics studies. However, its application is often complicated by the varied IDs of different versions. Here, we developed a user- friendly tool, SNPTracker, for comprehensively tracking and unifying the rs IDs and genomic coordinates of massive sequence variants at a time. It worked perfectly, and had much higher accuracy and capacity than two alternative utilities in our proof-of-principle examples. SNPTracker will greatly facilitate genetic data exchange and integration in the postgenome-wide association study era.","authors":["Deng J.-E.","Sham P.C.","Li M.-X."],"cit_count":2,"journal":"G3: Genes, Genomes, Genetics","pmid":"26585827","title":"SNPTracker: A swift tool for comprehensive tracking and unifying dbSNP rs IDs and genomic coordinates of massive sequence variants","year":"2016-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snptracker","biotoolsID":"snptracker","description":"A small tool to extract the latest version rsID and genomic coordinates of SNPs given any version of rs ID(s).","homepage":"http://statgenpro.psychiatry.hku.hk/limx/snptracker/","name":"SnpTracker"}}
