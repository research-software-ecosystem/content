Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Antibody structure is largely conserved, except for a complementarity-determining region featuring six variable loops. Five of these loops adopt canonical folds which can typically be predicted with existing methods, while the remaining loop (CDR H3) remains a challenge due to its highly diverse set of observed conformations. In recent years, deep neural networks have proven to be effective at capturing the complex patterns of protein structure. This work proposes DeepH3, a deep residual neural network that learns to predict inter-residue distances and orientations from antibody heavy and light chain sequence. The output of DeepH3 is a set of probability distributions over distances and orientation angles between pairs of residues. These distributions are converted to geometric potentials and used to discriminate between decoy structures produced by RosettaAntibody and predict new CDR H3 loop structures de novo. Results: When evaluated on the Rosetta antibody benchmark dataset of 49 targets, DeepH3-predicted potentials identified better, same and worse structures [measured by root-mean-squared distance (RMSD) from the experimental CDR H3 loop structure] than the standard Rosetta energy function for 33, 6 and 10 targets, respectively, and improved the average RMSD of predictions by 32.1% (1.4 \u00c5). Analysis of individual geometric potentials revealed that inter-residue orientations were more effective than inter-residue distances for discriminating near-native CDR H3 loops. When applied to de novo prediction of CDR H3 loop structures, DeepH3 achieves an average RMSD of 2.2 6 1.1 \u00c5 on the Rosetta antibody benchmark.
