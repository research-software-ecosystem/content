  "sc:description": "Program devised to rapidly scan a structural database with a query protein structure. It searches for the longest common substructures, called SHSP for “structural high scoring pairs”, between a query structure and every structure in the structural database. It makes use of protein backbone internal coordinates (α angles) in order to describe protein structures as sequences of symbols. It uses a deterministic finite automaton for pattern matching.",
