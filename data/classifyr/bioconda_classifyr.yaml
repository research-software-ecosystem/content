biotools_id: classifyr
description: The software formalises a framework for classification in R. There are
  four stages; Data transformation, feature selection, classifier training, and prediction.
  The requirements of variable types and names are fixed, but specialised variables
  for functions can also be provided. The classification framework is wrapped in a
  driver loop, that reproducibly carries out a number of cross-validation schemes.
  Functions for differential expression, differential variability, and differential
  distribution are included. Additional functions may be developed by the user, by
  creating an interface to the framework.
