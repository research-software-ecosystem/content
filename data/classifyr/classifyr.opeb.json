Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Although a large collection of classification software packages exist in R, a new generic framework for linking custom classification functions with classification performance measures is needed. A generic classification framework has been designed and implemented as an R package in an object oriented style. Its design places emphasis on parallel processing, reproducibility and extensibility. Finally, a comprehensive set of performance measures are available to ease post-processing. Taken together, these important characteristics enable rapid and reproducible benchmarking of alternative classifiers. Availability and implementation: ClassifyR is implemented in R and can be obtained from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ClassifyR.html.","authors":["Strbenac D.","Mann G.J.","Ormerod J.T.","Yang J.Y.H."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btv066","journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25644269","title":"ClassifyR: An R package for performance assessment of classification with applications to transcriptomics","type":"Primary","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:classifyr","biotoolsID":"classifyr","description":"The software formalises a framework for classification in R with four stages: data transformation, feature selection, classifier training, and prediction. The requirements of variable types and names are fixed, although specialised variables for functions can be provided. The classification framework is wrapped in a driver loop, that reproducibly carries out a number of cross-validation schemes.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ClassifyR.html","name":"ClassifyR","version":["1.8.1"]}}
