Here we present the new version, Frog2, which allows the generation of conformation ensembles of small molecules starting from either 1D, 2D or 3D description of the compounds. From a compound description in one of the SMILES, SDF or mol2 formats, the server will return an ensemble of diverse conformers generated using a two stage Monte Carlo approach in the dihedral space. When starting from 1D or 2D description of compounds, Frog2 is capable to detect the sites of ambiguous stereoisomery, and thus to sample different stereoisomers. Frog2 also embeds new energy minimization and ring generation facilities that solve the problem of some missing cycle structures in the Frog1 ring library. Finally, the optimized generator of conformation ensembles in Frog2 results in a gain of computational time permitting Frog2 to be up to 20 times faster that Frog1, while producing satisfactory conformations in terms of structural quality and conformational diversity. The high speed and the good quality of generated conformational ensembles makes it possible the treatment of larger compound collections using Frog2.
