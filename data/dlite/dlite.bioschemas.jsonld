      "sc:description": "DLITE Uses Cell-Cell Interface Movement to Better Infer Cell-Cell Tensions.\n\nCell shapes and connectivities evolve over time as the colony changes shape or embryos develop. Shapes of intercellular interfaces are closely coupled with the forces resulting from actomyosin interactions, membrane tension, or cell-cell adhesions. Although it is possible to computationally infer cell-cell forces from a mechanical model of collective cell behavior, doing so for temporally evolving forces in a manner robust to digitization difficulties is challenging. Here, we introduce a method for dynamic local intercellular tension estimation (DLITE) that infers such evolution in temporal force with less sensitivity to digitization ambiguities or errors. This method builds upon previous work on single time points (cellular force-inference toolkit). We validate our method using synthetic geometries.",
