Membrane Protein Explorer (MPEx), described in this article, is a refined and versatile hydropathy-plot software tool for analyzing membrane protein sequences. MPEx is highly interactive and facilitates the characterization and identification of favorable protein transmembrane regions using experimentbased physical and biological hydrophobicity scales. Besides allowing the consequences of sequence mutations to be examined, it provides tools for aiding the design of membrane-active peptides. MPEx is freely available as a Java Web Start application from our web site at http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpex.
