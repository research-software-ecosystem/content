    "description": "Variance-stabilized signals for sequencing-based genomic signals.\nVariance-stabilized signals (VSS) is a signal transformation approach used for eliminating the dependency of data variance from its mean. We generate VSS for sequencing-based genomic signals by learning the empirical relationship between the mean and variance of a given signal data set and producing transformed signals that normalize for this dependence.",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.An important function in the future healthcare system involves measuring a patient’s vital signs, transmitting the measured vital signs to a smart device or a management server, analyzing it in real-time, and informing the patient or medical staff. Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) incorporates information technology (IT) into patient monitoring device (PMD) and is developing traditional measurement devices into healthcare information systems. In the study, a portable ubiquitous-Vital (u-Vital) system is developed and consists of a Vital Block (VB), a small PMD, and Vital Sign Server (VSS), which stores and manages measured vital signs. Specifically, VBs collect a patient's electrocardiogram (ECG), blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), non-invasive blood pressure (NiBP), body temperature (BT) in real-time, and the collected vital signs are transmitted to a VSS via wireless protocols such as WiFi and Bluetooth. Additionally, an efficient R-point detection algorithm was also proposed for real-time processing and long-term ECG analysis. Experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of measurement, transmission, and analysis of vital signs in the proposed portable u-Vital system.",
