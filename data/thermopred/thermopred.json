Developing a computational method to identify mesophilic proteins would be helpful for protein engineering and design. In this work, we developed support vector machine based method to predict thermophilic proteins using the information of amino acid distribution and selected amino acid pairs. A reliable benchmark dataset including 915 thermophilic proteins and 793 non-thermophilic proteins was constructed for training and testing the proposed models. Results showed that 93.8% thermophilic proteins and 92.7% non-thermophilic proteins could be correctly predicted by using jackknife cross-validation. High predictive successful rate exhibits that this model can be applied for designing stable proteins. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier B.V.", "citationCount": 47, "authors": [{"name": "Lin H."}, {"name": "Chen W."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Microbiological Methods"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Hao Lin", "url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hlin@uestc.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:thermopred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/ThermoPredv1", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein property calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0250"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Sequence-based predictor for identifying thermophilic proteins.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/thermopred-identification-of-thermophilic-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "thermopred", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:03:16Z", "name": "ThermoPred", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/ThermoPred/readme", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
