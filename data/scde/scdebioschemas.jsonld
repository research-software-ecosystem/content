  "sc:description": "This package implements a set of statistical methods for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data by fitting individual error models for single-cell RNA-seq measurements. These models can then be used for the assessment of DE between groups of cells, as well as other types of analysis. This package also contains the pagoda framework which applies pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis to identify and characterize putative cell subpopulations based on transcriptional signatures.",
