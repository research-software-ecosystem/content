    "description": "This package implements a set of statistical methods for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data by fitting individual error models for single-cell RNA-seq measurements. These models can then be used for the assessment of DE between groups of cells, as well as other types of analysis. This package also contains the pagoda framework which applies pathway and gene set overdispersion analysis to identify and characterize putative cell subpopulations based on transcriptional signatures.",

However, the analysis of such measurements is complicated by high levels of technical noise and intrinsic biological variability. We describe a probabilistic model of expression-magnitude distortions typical of single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements, which enables detection of differential expression signatures and identification of subpopulations of cells in a way that is more tolerant of noise.",
