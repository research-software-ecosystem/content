This is work in progress, but eventually it should singificantly improve user experience, as Python allows much simpler installation procedures, makes it less error prone, allows to implement well-documented command-line interface (python mixer.py --help), and provide visualization.\n\nInput data for MiXeR consists of summary statistics from a GWAS, and a reference panel.",

Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Determining the relative contributions of functional genetic categories is fundamental to understanding the genetic etiology of complex human traits and diseases. Here, we present Annotation Informed-MiXeR, a likelihood-based method for estimating the number of variants influencing a phenotype and their effect sizes across different functional annotation categories of the genome using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Results: Extensive simulations demonstrate that the model is valid for a broad range of genetic architectures. The model suggests that complex human phenotypes substantially differ in the number of causal variants, their localization in the genome and their effect sizes. Specifically, the exons of protein-coding genes harbor more than 90% of variants influencing type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease, making them good candidates for whole-exome studies. In contrast, <10% of the causal variants for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are located in protein-coding exons, indicating a more substantial role of regulatory mechanisms in the pathogenesis of these disorders.",
