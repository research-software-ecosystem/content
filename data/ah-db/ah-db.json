Conformational transitions are commonly observed in various protein interactions that are involved in important biological functions. For example, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which destroys free superoxide radicals in the body, undergoes a large conformational transition from an 'open' state (apo structure) to a 'closed' state (holo structure). Many studies have utilized collections of apo-holo structure pairs to investigate the conformational transitions and critical residues. However, the collection process is usually complicated, varies from study to study and produces a small-scale data set. AH-DB is designed to provide an easy and unified way to prepare such data, which is generated by identifying/mapping molecules in different Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries. Conformational transitions are identified based on a refined alignment scheme to overcome the challenge that many structures in the PDB database are only protein fragments and not complete proteins. There are 746 314 apo-holo pairs in AH-DB, which is about 30 times those in the second largest collection of similar data. AH-DB provides sophisticated interfaces for searching apo-holo structure pairs and exploring conformational transitions from apo structures to the corresponding holo structures. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.", "citationCount": 10, "authors": [{"name": "Chang D.T.-H."}, {"name": "Yao T.-J."}, {"name": "Fan C.-Y."}, {"name": "Chiang C.-Y."}, {"name": "Bai Y.-H."}], "date": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "AH-DB team", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "darby@mail.ncku.edu.tw"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ah-db", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://ahdb.ee.ncku.edu.tw/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2406"}, {"term": "Protein structure assignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0320"}, {"term": "ID mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3282"}, {"term": "Mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2429"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Database of protein structure pairs (apo-holo structure pairs) before and after binding.
