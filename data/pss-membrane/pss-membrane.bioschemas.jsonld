Here a web-based PSS sever was developed for facilitating the protein design based on the QTY/NTY code. This server is expected to be used widely by scientists who are endeavoring in the research about alpha-helical proteins | QTY/NTY Design for Protein Solubilizing | Membrane proteins play vital roles in all living systems",
