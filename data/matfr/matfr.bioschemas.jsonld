Among them, 12 methods are from FSLib [1], 9 methods from mutual information (MI) based feature selection repository [2], 7 methods are used in MATLAB (“rankfeatures”, “relieff” and “lasso”), and others are accessible online. FR methods can be grouped into supervised and unsupervised methods. In this toolbox, there are 29 supervised and 13 unsupervised methods. FR methods can also be categorized from theoretical perspective. The matFR contains 12 MI based methods, 8 statistical analysis based methods, 8 structure learning based methods and others.",
