Compared with web-interface-based related tools, PACKMOL-Memgen allows setup of multiple configurations of a system in a user-friendly and efficient manner within minutes. The generated systems are well-packed and thus well-suited as starting configurations in MD simulations under periodic boundary conditions, requiring only moderate equilibration times. PACKMOL-Memgen is distributed with AmberTools and runs on most computing platforms, and its output can also be used for CHARMM or adapted to other molecular-simulation packages.",
