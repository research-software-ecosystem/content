Compared with web-interface-based related tools, PACKMOL-Memgen allows setup of multiple configurations of a system in a user-friendly and efficient manner within minutes. The generated systems are well-packed and thus well-suited as starting configurations in MD simulations under periodic boundary conditions, requiring only moderate equilibration times. PACKMOL-Memgen is distributed with AmberTools and runs on most computing platforms, and its output can also be used for CHARMM or adapted to other molecular-simulation packages.","authors":["Schott-Verdugo S.","Gohlke H."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1021/ACS.JCIM.9B00269","journal":"Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling","pmid":"31120747","title":"PACKMOL-Memgen: A Simple-To-Use, Generalized Workflow for Membrane-Protein-Lipid-Bilayer System Building","type":"Primary","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:PACKMOL-Memgen","biotoolsID":"PACKMOL-Memgen","description":"Generalized workflow for automated building of membrane-protein-lipid-bilayer systems based on open-source tools including Packmol, memembed, pdbremix, and AmberTools.","homepage":"http://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php","name":"PACKMOL-Memgen"}}
