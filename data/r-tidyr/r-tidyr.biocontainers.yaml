description: Tools to help to create tidy data, where each column is a variable, each
  row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value. tidyr contains tools
  for changing the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy (nesting and unnesting) of a dataset,
  turning deeply nested lists into rectangular data frames (rectangling), and extracting
  values out of string columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values
  (both implicit and explicit).
