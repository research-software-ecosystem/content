The resulting data are essential in documenting the mechanism of action and precision of endonucleolytically active, RNA-targeting drugs such as RNase H-active antisense or small interfering RNA. When applied to error-prone replication systems such as RNA viruses or in vitro RNA replicon systems, the method can additionally report the relative susceptibility of known and unknown polymorphisms to a prospective sequence-specific drug, making it a powerful tool in patient selection and stratification as well as resistance prediction. We describe the preparation of sequencing libraries for ultra-high depth 5′ RLM-RACE analysis on two popular second-generation high-throughput sequencing platforms (Illumina, Ion Torrent) and supply a detailed bioinformatics analysis pipeline for target site activity definition and enumeration. We further illustrate how the pipeline can be simply modified to generate polymorphism-specific drug susceptibility data from in vitro replicon experiments (RACE-SEQ-MM), in a patient-free manner, to cover both known and unknown target site variants in the population.","authors":["Usher L.","Theotokis P.I.","Moschos S.A."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-9670-4_17","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","pmid":"31410804","title":"RACE-SEQ and Population-Wide Polymorphism Susceptibility Testing for Endonucleolytically Active, RNA-Targeting Therapeutics","year":"2019-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:RACE-SEQ","biotoolsID":"RACE-SEQ","description":"> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'RNA-targeting', 'endonucleolytically', 'RLM-RACE' | RACE-SEQ and Population-Wide Polymorphism Susceptibility Testing for Endonucleolytically Active, RNA-Targeting Therapeutics | Pipeline for the downstream analysis of 5-RACE Next Generation Sequencing experiments | This is a custom R script for the downstream analysis of RACE-seq data | To run the RACE-SEQ-lite script you will need to have an R version ( >=3.4) installed on your system.
