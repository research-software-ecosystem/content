      "sc:description": "Bayesian annotations for targeted lipidomics (BATL) is a bioinformatic tools capable of annotating, rapidly and reproducibly, large targeted lipidomic datasets are limited. Specifically, few programs enable high-throughput peak assessment of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) data acquired in either selected or multiple reaction monitoring (SRM and MRM) modes. It is a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier for targeted lipidomics, that annotates peak identities according to eight features related to retention time, intensity, and peak shape. Lipid identification is achieved by modelling distributions of these eight input features across biological conditions and maximizing the joint posterior probabilities of all peak identities at a given transition.",
