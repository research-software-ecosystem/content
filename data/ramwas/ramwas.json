Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: Enrichment-based technologies can provide measurements of DNA methylation at tens of millions of CpGs for thousands of samples. Existing tools for methylome-wide association studies cannot analyze datasets of this size and lack important features like principal component analysis, combined analysis with SNP data and outcome predictions that are based on all informative methylation sites. Results: We present a Bioconductor R package called RaMWAS with a full set of tools for largescale methylome-wide association studies. It is free, cross-platform, open source, memory efficient and fast.", "citationCount": 4, "authors": [{"name": "Shabalin A.A."}, {"name": "Hattab M.W."}, {"name": "Clark S.L."}, {"name": "Chan R.F."}, {"name": "Kumar G."}, {"name": "Aberg K.A."}, {"name": "Van Den Oord E.J.C.G."}], "date": "2018-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Andrey A Shabalin", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "andrey.shabalin@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ramwas", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.4.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ramwas.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Enrichment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A complete toolset for methylome-wide association studies (MWAS).
