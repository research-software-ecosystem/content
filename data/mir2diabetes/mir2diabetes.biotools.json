    "description": "A Literature-Curated Database of microRNA Expression Patterns, in Diabetic Microvascular Complications.\nmiR2Diabetes aims to provide a comprehensive resource of miRNA dysregulation in diabetic microvascular complications (DMC). Each entry in the miR2Diabetes contains detailed information on a miRNA-DMC relationship, including miRNA symbol, DMC name, experiment subjects, miRNA dysregulation pattern in a specific experimental design, and literature reference.\n\nmicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been established as critical regulators of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM), and diabetes microvascular complications (DMCs).  The annotations in the database cover 14 DM and DMC phenotypes, involving 156 miRNAs, by browsing diverse sample origins (e.g., blood, kidney, liver, and other tissues).",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.microRNAs (miRNAs) have been established as critical regulators of the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM), and diabetes microvascular complications (DMCs). However, manually curated databases for miRNAs, and DM (including DMCs) association studies, have yet to be established. Here, we constructed a user-friendly database, “miR2Diabetes,” equipped with a graphical web interface for simple browsing or searching manually curated annotations. The annotations in our database cover 14 DM and DMC phenotypes, involving 156 miRNAs, by browsing diverse sample origins (e.g., blood, kidney, liver, and other tissues). Additionally, we provide miRNA annotations for disease-model organisms (including rats and mice), of DM and DMCs, for the purpose of improving knowledge of the biological complexity of these pathologies. We assert that our database will be a comprehensive resource for miRNA biomarker studies, as well as for prioritizing miRNAs for functional validation, in DM and DMCs, with likely extension to other diseases.",
