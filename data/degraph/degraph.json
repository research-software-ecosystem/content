An important application of such tests is the detection of differentially expressed genes between two patient populations, as shifts in expression levels are expected to be coherent with the structure of graphs reflecting gene properties such as biological process, molecular function, regulation or metabolism. For a fixed graph of interest, we demonstrate that accounting for graph structure can yield more powerful tests under the assumption of smooth distribution shift on the graph. We also investigate the identification of nonhomogeneous subgraphs of a given large graph, which poses both computational and multiple hypothesis testing problems. The relevance and benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated on synthetic data and on breast and bladder cancer gene expression data analyzed in the context of KEGG and NCI pathways. \u00a9 Institute of Mathematical Statistics, 2012.", "citationCount": 33, "authors": [{"name": "Jacob L."}, {"name": "Neuvial P."}, {"name": "Dudoit S."}], "date": "2012-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Annals of Applied Statistics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Laurent Jacob", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "laurent.jacob@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:degraph", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.26.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEGraph.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Implements recent hypothesis testing methods to assess whether a particular gene network is differentially expressed between two conditions.
