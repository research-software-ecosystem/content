  "sc:description": "Implements recent hypothesis testing methods to assess whether a particular gene network is differentially expressed between two conditions. This is to be contrasted with the more classical two-step approaches. These recent methods consider the topology of the network to yield more powerful detection procedures. It provides methods to easily test all KEGG pathways for differential expression on any gene expression data set and tools to visualize the results.",
