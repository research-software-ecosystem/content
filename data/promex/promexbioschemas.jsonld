  "sc:description": "A mass spectral library consisting of tryptic peptide product ion spectra generated by liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-ITMS). Developed using samples derived from Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula. The database serves as a reference and can be used for protein identification in uncharacterized samples. Protein identification is linked to other molecular levels of biological organization such as metabolite, pathway and transcript data.",
