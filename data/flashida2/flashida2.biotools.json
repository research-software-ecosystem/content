    "description": "FLASHIda is an intelligent online data acquisition algorithm for top-down proteomics (TDP) that ensures the real-time selection of high-quality precursors of diverse proteoforms. FLASHIda combines fast decharging algorithms in FLASHDeconv and machine learning-based quality assessment to identify optimal precursors for fragmentation. Currently the C# source code and instruction of FLASHIda is available in here under a BSD three-clause license. We are working on merging FLASHIda into OpenMS.",
