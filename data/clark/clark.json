Although this problem has been extensively studied, it is still computationally challenging due to size of the datasets that modern sequencing technologies can produce. Results: We introduce Clark a novel approach to classify metagenomic reads at the species or genus level with high accuracy and high speed. Extensive experimental results on various metagenomic samples show that the classification accuracy of Clark is better or comparable to the best state-of-the-art tools and it is significantly faster than any of its competitors. In its fastest single-threaded mode Clark classifies, with high accuracy, about 32 million metagenomic short reads per minute. Clark can also classify BAC clones or transcripts to chromosome arms and centromeric regions. Conclusions: Clark is a versatile, fast and accurate sequence classification method, especially useful for metagenomics and genomics applications.", "citationCount": 120, "authors": [{"name": "Ounit R."}, {"name": "Wanamaker S."}, {"name": "Close T.J."}, {"name": "Lonardi S."}], "date": "2015-03-25T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "ebi.ac.uk", "url": "http://www.ebi.ac.uk/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Stefano Lonardi", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "stelo@cs.ucr.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:clark", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1-2-2-beta"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://clark.cs.ucr.edu/", "function": [{"note": "Metagenomic classification (using the bacterial/archaeal genomes of NCBI/RefSeq), extensive experimental results show that CLARK's classification precision and sensitivity, at the genus/species level, are better or equivalent than best state-of-the-art tools, and it is significantly faster than any published methods Input file for Clark is fasta-formated sequence Output is a single comma-separated file giving the length and assignments for each read", "input": [{"data": {"term": "DNA sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_3494"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA-like", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2546"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Taxonomic classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3460"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Taxonomy", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_3028"}, "format": [{"term": "TSV", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_3475"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Classification method based on a supervised sequence classification using discriminative k-mers.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://clark.cs.ucr.edu/Tool/", "note": null, "type": "Repository"}], "biotoolsID": "clark", "additionDate": "2016-04-12T13:51:45Z", "name": "CLARK", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://clark.cs.ucr.edu", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows", "Mac"]}
