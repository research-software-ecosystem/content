      "sc:description": "Aird is a new format for mass spectrometry data storage. It is an opensource and computation-oriented format with controllable precision, flexible indexing strategies, and high compression rate for m/z and intensity pairs. Aird provides a novel compressor call ZDPD for m/z data compression,which makes up an amazing compression rate. Compared with Zip, m/z data is about 55% lower in the Aird on average. Aird is a computational friendly algorithm. Through SIMD optimization, the decoding speed of Aird is much higher than that of Zip.\nAirdPro is opensource under the MulanPSL2 license.",
