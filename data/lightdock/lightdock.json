Motivation: Computational prediction of protein-protein complex structure by docking can provide structural and mechanistic insights for protein interactions of biomedical interest. However, current methods struggle with difficult cases, such as those involving flexible proteins, low-affinity complexes or transient interactions. A major challenge is how to efficiently sample the structural and energetic landscape of the association at different resolution levels, given that each scoring function is often highly coupled to a specific type of search method. Thus, new methodologies capable of accommodating multi-scale conformational flexibility and scoring are strongly needed. Results: We describe here a new multi-scale protein-protein docking methodology, LightDock, capable of accommodating conformational flexibility and a variety of scoring functions at different resolution levels. Implicit use of normal modes during the search and atomic/coarse-grained combined scoring functions yielded improved predictive results with respect to state-of-the-art rigidbody docking, especially in flexible cases.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Jimenez-Garcia B."}, {"name": "Roel-Touris J."}, {"name": "Romero-Durana M."}, {"name": "Vidal M."}, {"name": "Jimenez-Gonzalez D."}, {"name": "Fernandez-Recio J."}], "date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Brian Jimenez", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "brian.jimenez@bsc.es"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:lightdock", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["0.4.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://life.bsc.es/pid/lightdock/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Protein complex", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2877"}, "format": [{"term": "PDB", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1476"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Protein-protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2464"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein complex", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2877"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "It is a protein-protein docking framework based on the Glowworm Swarm Optimization algorithm.\nThe framework is highly versatile, with many options that can be further developed and optimized by the users: it can accept any user-defined scoring function, can use local gradient-free minimization, the simulation can be restrained from the beginning to focus on user-assigned interacting regions, and it has support for the use of pre-calculated conformers for both receptor and ligand.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/brianjimenez/lightdock", "note": null, "type": "Repository"}], "biotoolsID": "lightdock", "additionDate": "2017-11-02T09:30:52Z", "name": "LightDock", "license": "Other", "documentation": [{"url": "https://readthedocs.org/projects/lightdock/", "note": null, "type": "API documentation"}, {"url": "https://github.com/brianjimenez/lightdock/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}, {"url": "https://github.com/brianjimenez/lightdock/blob/master/LICENSE", "note": null, "type": "Terms of use"}], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
