      "sc:description": "Alignment-free identification of bacteriophage genomes by deep learning.\n\nSeeker is a python library for discriminating between bacterial and phage genomes. Seeker is based on an LSTM deep-learning models and does not rely on a reference genome, genomic alignment or any direct genome comparison.\n\nAlignment free identification of novel phages via a deep learning framework.\n\nMaximum file size is 10MB. For large-scale datasets, please use the accompanying Python package.\n\nThe MATLAB and Python model types differ in how they represent the DNA sequences. They are largely equivalent in their performance. The default recommendation is to use the Python model, as it uses fewer parameters.",
