Many softwares are available for T(m) calculations, but difficulties arise when one wishes to check if a given oligomer (PCR primer or probe) hybridizes well or not on more than a single sequence. Moreover, the presence of mismatches within the duplex is not sufficient to estimate specificity as it does not always significantly decrease the T(m). OHM (OligoHeatMap) is an online tool able to provide estimates of T(m) for a set of oligomers and a set of aligned sequences, not only as text files of complete results but also in a graphical way: T(m) values are translated into colors and displayed as a heat map image, either stand alone or to be used by softwares such as TreeDyn to be included in a phylogenetic tree. OHM is freely available at http://bioinfo.unice.fr/ohm/, with links to the full source code and online help.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Croce O."}, {"name": "Chevenet F."}, {"name": "Christen R."}], "date": "2008-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic acids research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:oligoheatmap", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.bioinfomed.fr/__Tools/ohm/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}, {"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-14T15:47:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Online tool for estimation of melting temperatures for sets of oligonucleotides and positioning of oligomers within sets of aligned sequences.
