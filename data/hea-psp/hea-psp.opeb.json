This problem is a central challenge in computational biology. It can be posed as an optimization problem, but current top ab-initio protocols employ Monte Carlo sampling rather than evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for conformational search. This paper presents a hybrid EA that incorporates successful strategies used in state-of-the-art ab-initio protocols. Comparison to a top Monte-Carlo-based sampling method shows that the domain-specific enhancements make the proposed hybrid EA competitive. A detailed analysis on the role of crossover operators and a novel implementation of homologous 1-point crossover shows that the use of crossover with mutation is more effective than mutation alone in navigating the protein energy surface.
