This study investigates whether the accuracy of protein structure prediction can be improved using a loop-specific sampling strategy. RESULTS:A novel de novo protein structure prediction method that combines global exploration and loop perturbation is proposed in this study. In the global exploration phase, the fragment recombination and assembly are used to explore the massive conformational space and generate native-like topology. In the loop perturbation phase, a loop-specific local perturbation model is designed to improve the accuracy of the conformation and is solved by differential evolution algorithm.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!","homepage":"https://github.com/iobiozjut/CGLFold","name":"CGLFold"}}
