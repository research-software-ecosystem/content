    "description": "A Method for Predicting Hemolytic Potency of Chemically Modified Peptides From Its Structure.\n\n\nHemoPI-MOD is an in silico method, which is developed to predict hemolytic or hemotoxic or RBC lysing potential of a peptide. The main dataset used in this method consists of 582 modified hemolytic peptides and 582 non-hemolytic peptides. This full dataset was divided into two parts (i) Training dataset and (ii) Validation dataset.",

All models have been trained, tested, and evaluated on a dataset that contains 583 modified hemolytic peptides and a balanced number of non-hemolytic peptides. Machine learning techniques have been used to build the classification models using an immense range of peptide features that include 2D, 3D descriptors, fingerprints, atom, and diatom compositions. Random Forest based model developed using fingerprints as an input feature achieved maximum accuracy of 78.33% with AUC of 0.86 on the main dataset and accuracy of 78.29% with AUC of 0.85 on the validation dataset. Models developed in this study have been incorporated in a web server \u201cHemoPImod\u201d to facilitate the scientific community (http://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/ hemopimod/).",
