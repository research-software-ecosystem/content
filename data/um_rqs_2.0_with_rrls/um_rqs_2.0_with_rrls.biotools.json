    "description": "Radiomics is a medical imaging analysis tool that supports precision oncology by providing quantitative insights for clinical decision-making. The updated Radiomics Quality Score 2.0 (RQS 2.0) enhances the original RQS framework by integrating concepts of fairness, explainability, quality control, and harmonization, ensuring more rigorous and transparent evaluation of radiomics studies. It also introduces Radiomics Readiness Levels (RRLs)—a nine-stage framework inspired by technology readiness levels—to track progress from research to clinical implementation. Together, RQS 2.0 and RRLs provide a structured path to accelerate the clinical translation of radiomics and advance precision oncology.",
