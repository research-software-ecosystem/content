From Fast5 files generated by ONT, the tool displays relative similarities between signals using the dynamic time warping and the t-SNE algorithms. Raw signals can be visualized through mouse actions while particular signals of interest can also be exported as a CSV file for further analysis. Sequoia consists of two major components: the command-line back-end that performs necessary computations using Python and the front-end that displays the visualization through a web interface. Two datasets are used to conduct a case study in order to illustrate the usability of the tool.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/801811","name":"Sequoia"}}
