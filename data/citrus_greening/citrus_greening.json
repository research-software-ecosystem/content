Fruit from infected trees is safe to eat, but production is reduced so much that citrus may cease to be inexpensive and broadly available. If you are a citrus lover you should know that massive research efforts, including this project, are underway to keep citrus affordable and plentiful. See impact on US production..\n\nThe Asian citrus psyllid is a sap-sucking, hemipteran bug in the family Psyllidae. The new v2.0 genome is online!",
