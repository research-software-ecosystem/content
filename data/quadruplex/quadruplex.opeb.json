G-quadruplexes have various biological functions, including inhibition of telomerase and the regulation of gene transcription and translation, and have become an active target for drug development, particularly for novel anticancer therapies. The physiological functions of G-quadruplexes are discussed in this review and the current knowledge of G-quadruplex ligand and drug development is outlined. © Thomson Reuters (Scientific) Ltd.","authors":["Wong H.M.","Payet L.","Huppert J.L."],"cit_count":68,"journal":"Current Opinion in Molecular Therapeutics","pmid":"19330720","title":"Function and targeting of G-quadruplexes","year":"2009-04-10"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:quadruplex","biotoolsID":"quadruplex","description":"A website to serve the quadruplex community.
