This method provides a useful alternative to more computationally intensive permutation tests. A user-friendly interface (SNPSpD) for performing this correction is available online (http://genepi.qimr.edu.au/general/daleN/SNPSpD/). Additionally, output from SNPSpD includes eigenvalues, principal-component coefficients, and factor \"loadings\" after varimax rotation, enabling the selection of a subset of SNPs that optimize the information in a genomic region.","authors":["Nyholt D.R."],"cit_count":1200,"journal":"American Journal of Human Genetics","pmid":"14997420","title":"A Simple Correction for Multiple Testing for Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Linkage Disequilibrium with Each Other","year":"2004-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snpspd","biotoolsID":"snpspd","description":"A method of correcting for non-independence of SNPs in LD with each other.","homepage":"http://neurogenetics.qimrberghofer.edu.au/SNPSpD/","name":"SNPSpD"}}
