    "description": "This module provides tools for analyzing and processing DICOM serial files with a focus on image comparison and deduplication. It searches directories for DICOM series, organizes them by patient ID and SeriesInstanceUID and excludes certain modalities. It detects duplicate files within series using metadata checks and performs perceptual matching by comparing perceptual hashes at the series level. For identified duplicate candidates, it performs a deeper content-based analysis using SSIM and cosine similarity metrics to confirm visual similarity. The module provides a detailed report on duplicates and potential matches, helping to ensure the consistency and integrity of DICOM records",
