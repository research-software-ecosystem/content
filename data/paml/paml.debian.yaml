description: "PAML is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or protein\
  \ sequences using maximum likelihood. PAML is not good for tree making. It may be\
  \ used to estimate parameters and test hypotheses to study the evolutionary process,\
  \ when you have reconstructed trees using other programs such as PAUP*, PHYLIP,\
  \ MOLPHY, PhyML, RaxML, etc.\n"
