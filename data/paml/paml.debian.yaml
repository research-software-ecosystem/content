description: PAML is a package of programs for phylogenetic analyses of DNA or protein
  sequences using maximum likelihood. PAML is not good for tree making. It may be
  used to estimate parameters and test hypotheses to study the evolutionary process,
  when you have reconstructed trees using other programs such as PAUP*, PHYLIP, MOLPHY,
  PhyML, RaxML, etc.
