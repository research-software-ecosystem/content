All rights reserved.Motivation: DNA N6-methyladenine (6 mA) has recently been found as an essential epigenetic modification, playing its roles in a variety of cellular processes. The abnormal status of DNA 6 mA modification has been reported in cancer and other disease. The annotation of 6 mA marks in genome is the first crucial step to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms including its regulatory roles. Results: We present a novel online DNA 6 mA site tool, 6 mA-Finder, by incorporating seven sequence-derived information and three physicochemical-based features through recursive feature elimination strategy. Our multiple cross-validations indicate the promising accuracy and robustness of our model. 6 mA-Finder outperforms its peer tools in general and species-specific 6 mA site prediction, suggesting it can provide a useful resource for further experimental investigation of DNA 6 mA modification.",
