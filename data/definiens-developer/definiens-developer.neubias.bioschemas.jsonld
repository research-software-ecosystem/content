  "http://schema.org/description": "Definiens is a commercial  image segmentation and classification tool. The user designs a signal processing workflow by combining built-in filtering, thresholding and object classification modules. Object detection is typically done on hierarchical object levels, e.g cell level for  cell objects and organelle level Nucleus and ER obejcts inside a cell object.\r\nFor each object, a huge set of features (shape-based, intensity based, relations to neighbor objects...) is available and can be used for object classification or merging with neighboring objects. \r\nThe classical definiens workflow is the so called bottom-up approach: In a first step, the image is segmented in numerous small objects, resulting in a heavy oversegmentation of of the target objects. Objects are then fused step by step on basis of features like relative border to neighbor object or elliptic fit of resulting (fused) object. Objects can assigned to different classes (like nucleus or cancer cell), based on their features. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-complex to use\r\n-closed (no API)\r\n-very expensive\r\n-relatively slow (you have to buy one license for each core)\r\n-bad 3D-visualization\r\n-time lapse analysis is possible but complicated\r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n-powerful method to classify objects based on multiple features\r\n-2D data, especially histological data\r\n-good training material to learn software usage\r\n-detailed documentation\r\n",
