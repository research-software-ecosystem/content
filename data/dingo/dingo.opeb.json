DiNGO is a command line application which is able to do GO and HPO term enrichment on a set of genes or proteins. DiNGO is multithreaded application which offers fast processing of large datasets. In addition, the application offers gene/protein identifiers conversion tool as well as automatic download of HPO and GO annotation resources.\n\nDiNGO is a standalone application based on an open source code from BiNGO [1], a Java based tool aimed at determining which Gene Ontology (GO) categories are overrepresented in a set of genes",
