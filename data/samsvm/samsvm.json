However, because misalignment of sequences poses a significant problem in analysis of sequencing data that could lead to false positives in variant calling, the exclusion of misaligned reads is a necessity in analysis. In this regard, the multiple features of SAM-formatted sequences can be treated as vectors in a multi-dimension space to allow the application of a support vector machine (SVM). Applying the LIBSVM tools developed by Chang and Lin [Chang C-C, Lin C-J, ACM Trans Intell Syst Technol 2:1-27, 2011.] as a simple interface for support vector classification, the SAMSVM package has been developed in this study to enable misalignment filtration of SAM-formatted sequences. Cross-validation between two simulated datasets processed with SAMSVM yielded accuracies that ranged from 0.89 to 0.97 with F-scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.94 in 14 groups characterized by different mutation rates from 0.001 to 0.1, indicating that the model built using SAMSVM was accurate in misalignment detection. Application of SAMSVM to actual sequencing data resulted in filtration of misaligned reads and correction of variant calling.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Yang J."}, {"name": "Ding X."}, {"name": "Sun X."}, {"name": "Tsang S.-Y."}, {"name": "Xue H."}], "date": "2015-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://sourceforge.net/u/jyangad86/profile/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:samsvm", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/samsvm/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence contamination filtering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3187"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2945"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:49Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Applying the LIBSVM, a package of support vector machine, this tool was developed to correctly detect and filter the misaligned reads of SAM format.
