    "description": "Boosting Granular Support Vector Machines for the Accurate Prediction of Protein-Nucleotide Binding Sites | AIM AND OBJECTIVE:The accurate identification of protein-ligand binding sites helps elucidate protein function and facilitate the design of new drugs. Machine-learning-based methods have been widely used for the prediction of protein-ligand binding sites. Nevertheless, the severe class imbalance phenomenon, where the number of nonbinding (majority) residues is far greater than that of binding (minority) residues, has a negative impact on the performance of such machine-learning-based predictors. MATERIALS AND METHODS:In this study, we aim to relieve the negative impact of class imbalance by boosting multiple granular support vector machines (BGSVM). In BGSVM, each base SVM is trained on a granular training subset consisting of all minority samples and some reasonably selected majority samples",
