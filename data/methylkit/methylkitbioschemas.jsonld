The package is designed to deal with sequencing data from RRBS and its variants, but also target-capture methods and whole genome bisulfite sequencing. It also has functions to analyze base-pair resolution 5hmC data from experimental protocols such as oxBS-Seq and TAB-Seq. Perl is needed to read SAM files only.",
