biotools_id: methylkit
description: methylKit is an R package for DNA methylation analysis and annotation
  from high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. The package is designed to deal with
  sequencing data from RRBS and its variants, but also target-capture methods and
  whole genome bisulfite sequencing. It also has functions to analyze base-pair resolution
  5hmC data from experimental protocols such as oxBS-Seq and TAB-Seq. Methylation
  calling can be performed directly from Bismark aligned BAM files.
