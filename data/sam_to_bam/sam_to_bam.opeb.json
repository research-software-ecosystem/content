It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAM tools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments. © 2009 The Author(s).","authors":["Li H.","Handsaker B.","Wysoker A.","Fennell T.","Ruan J.","Homer N.","Marth G.","Abecasis G.","Durbin R."],"cit_count":13604,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btp352","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"The Sequence Alignment/Map format and SAMtools","type":"Primary","year":"2009-08-01"},{"abstract":"© The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","authors":["Afgan E.","Baker D.","van den Beek M.","Blankenberg D.","Bouvier D.","Cech M.","Chilton J.","Clements D.","Coraor N.","Eberhard C.","Gruning B.","Guerler A.","Hillman-Jackson J.","Von Kuster G.","Rasche E.","Soranzo N.","Turaga N.","Taylor J.","Nekrutenko A.","Goecks J."],"cit_count":522,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkw343","journal":"Nucleic acids research","title":"The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update","type":"Other","year":"2016-07-08"},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","type":"Other"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sam_to_bam-ip","biotoolsID":"sam_to_bam","description":"Converts SAM format to BAM format.","homepage":"http://www.htslib.org/","name":"sam_to_bam","version":["0.1.19"]}}
