Here we show that short, linear protein motifs can be efficiently recovered from proteome-scale datasets such as sub-cellular localization, molecular function, half-life, and protein abundance data using an information theoretic approach. Using this approach, we have identified many known protein motifs, such as phosphorylation sites and localization signals, and discovered a large number of candidate elements. We estimate that ~80% of these are novel predictions in that they do not match a known motif in both sequence and biological context, suggesting that post-translational regulation of protein behavior is still largely unexplored. These predicted motifs, many of which display preferential association with specific biological pathways and non-random positioning in the linear protein sequence, provide focused hypotheses for experimental validation. \u00a9 2010 Lieber et al.", "citationCount": 25, "authors": [{"name": "Lieber D.S."}, {"name": "Elemento O."}, {"name": "Tavazoie S."}], "date": "2010-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://tavazoielab.c2b2.columbia.edu/lab/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:fire-pro", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.1"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://tavazoielab.c2b2.columbia.edu/FIRE-pro/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence motif discovery", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Motif discovery and characterization program for proteins based on mutual information", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/fire-pro-1-1-motif-discovery-characterization-program-proteins-based-mutual-information.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "fire-pro", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:06:16Z", "name": "FIRE-pro", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://tavazoielab.c2b2.columbia.edu/FIRE-pro/tutorial.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
