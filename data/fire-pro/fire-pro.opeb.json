Here we show that short, linear protein motifs can be efficiently recovered from proteome-scale datasets such as sub-cellular localization, molecular function, half-life, and protein abundance data using an information theoretic approach. Using this approach, we have identified many known protein motifs, such as phosphorylation sites and localization signals, and discovered a large number of candidate elements. We estimate that ~80% of these are novel predictions in that they do not match a known motif in both sequence and biological context, suggesting that post-translational regulation of protein behavior is still largely unexplored. These predicted motifs, many of which display preferential association with specific biological pathways and non-random positioning in the linear protein sequence, provide focused hypotheses for experimental validation. © 2010 Lieber et al.","authors":["Lieber D.S.","Elemento O.","Tavazoie S."],"cit_count":25,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0014444","journal":"PLoS ONE","title":"Large-scale discovery and characterization of protein regulatory motifs in eukaryotes","type":"Primary","year":"2010-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:fire-pro","biotoolsID":"fire-pro","description":"Motif discovery and characterization program for proteins based on mutual information","homepage":"https://tavazoielab.c2b2.columbia.edu/FIRE-pro/","name":"FIRE-pro","version":["1.1"]}}
