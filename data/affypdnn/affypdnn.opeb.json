A new method to estimate the gene expression value utilizing the probe sequence information named position-dependent nearest-neighbor (PDNN) has been suggested by Zhang et al. (2003). Here we describe an open source implementation of the PDNN method for the statistical language R. © The Author 2004. Published by Oxford University Press.
