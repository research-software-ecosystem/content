    "description": "open source collaborative platform for the annotation of human genetic variation.\n\nA modular annotation tool for genomic variants.\n\nOpen-CRAVAT is a python package that performs genomic variant interpretation including variant impact, annotation, and scoring. It has a modular architecture with a wide variety of analysis modules that are developed both by the CRAVAT team and the broader variant analysis community. Open-CRAVAT is a product of the Karchin Lab at Johns Hopkins University in collaboration with In Silico Solutions with funding provided by the National Cancer Institute's ITCR program.\n\nOpen Custom Ranked Analysis of Variants Toolkit.\n\nCRAVAT 5 is in GRCh38/hg38. If you need to annotate GRCh37/hg19 variants, check the hg19 box under Input section or use CRAVAT 4 which is in GRCh37/hg19.\n\nDocumentation and Getting Started.\n\nGet started with OpenCRAVAT here or with `pip install open-cravat`.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/cravat (CRAVAT.US)",
