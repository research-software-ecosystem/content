So far, TCGA researchers have analysed large cohorts of over 30 human tumours through large-scale genome sequencing and integrated multi-dimensional analyses. Studies of individual cancer types, as well as comprehensive pan-cancer analyses have extended current knowledge of tumorigenesis. A major goal of the project was to provide publicly available datasets to help improve diagnostic methods, treatment standards, and finally to prevent cancer. This review discusses the current status of TCGA Research Network structure, purpose, and achievements.","authors":["Tomczak K.","Czerwinska P.","Wiznerowicz M."],"cit_count":127,"doi":"10.5114/wo.2014.47136","journal":"Wspolczesna Onkologia","title":"The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): An immeasurable source of knowledge","type":"Review","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tcga_api","biotoolsID":"tcga_api","description":"Comprehensive and coordinated effort to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of genome analysis technologies, including large-scale genome sequencing.","homepage":"https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+DCC+Web+Service+User's+Guide","name":"The Cancer Genome Atlas API","version":["1"]}}
