  description: Genotyping from short reads using cloud computing
  long_description: " Crossbow is a scalable software pipeline for whole genome resequencing\n\
    \ analysis. It combines Bowtie, an ultrafast and memory efficient short read\n\
    \ aligner, and SoapSNP, an accurate genotyper, within Hadoop to distribute and\n\
    \ accelerate the computation with many nodes. The pipeline can accurately analyze\n\
    \ over 35x coverage of a human genome in one day on a 10-node local cluster, or\n\
    \ in 3 hours for about $100 using a 40-node, 320-core cluster rented from\n Amazon's
    EC2 utility computing service."
