It includes a comparative genome browser based on phylogenetic trees for every gene family as well as a species tree. To identify co-regulated genes, it can search for genes based on their expression profile, and provides tools for identifying regulatory motifs and seeing if they are conserved. It also includes fast phylogenetic profile searches and more.",
