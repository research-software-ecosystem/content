    "description": "Bacteria as \u201cink\u201d for writing the initials of names on agar.\n\nMementos encapsulate memories and serve as triggers for their recollections. By using a purple pigment producing bacterium as \u201cink\u201d for writing on agar, a picture memento depicting the initials of students\u2019 names was created to help them remember the strong friendships they fostered with their fellow course mates during their final year research projects. Besides the fun activity of \u201cBacterial calligraphy\u201d, the surface patterning technique can also serve as a simple and relatively low cost tool for testing the feasibility of research ideas; for example, depositing cells in both straight and curvilinear lines on planar substrates for investigating possible interactions between different microbe species.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE '172-174', 'memento', 'Calligraphy Memento', 'calligraphy'",
