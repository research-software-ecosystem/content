By using a purple pigment producing bacterium as “ink” for writing on agar, a picture memento depicting the initials of students’ names was created to help them remember the strong friendships they fostered with their fellow course mates during their final year research projects. Besides the fun activity of “Bacterial calligraphy”, the surface patterning technique can also serve as a simple and relatively low cost tool for testing the feasibility of research ideas; for example, depositing cells in both straight and curvilinear lines on planar substrates for investigating possible interactions between different microbe species.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE '172-174', 'memento', 'Calligraphy Memento', 'calligraphy'","homepage":"http://jmbe.asm.org/index.php/jmbe/article/view/414","name":"Journal Microbiology Biology Education"}}
