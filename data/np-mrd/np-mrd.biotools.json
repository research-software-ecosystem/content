                "abstract": "© 2022 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Natural Products Magnetic Resonance Database (NP-MRD) is a comprehensive, freely available electronic resource for the deposition, distribution, searching and retrieval of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data on natural products, metabolites and other biologically derived chemicals. NMR spectroscopy has long been viewed as the 'gold standard' for the structure determination of novel natural products and novel metabolites. NMR is also widely used in natural product dereplication and the characterization of biofluid mixtures (metabolomics). All of these NMR applications require large collections of high quality, well-annotated, referential NMR spectra of pure compounds. Unfortunately, referential NMR spectral collections for natural products are quite limited. It is because of the critical need for dedicated, open access natural product NMR resources that the NP-MRD was funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH). Since its launch in 2020, the NP-MRD has grown quickly to become the world's largest repository for NMR data on natural products and other biological substances. It currently contains both structural and NMR data for nearly 41,000 natural product compounds from >7400 different living species. All structural, spectroscopic and descriptive data in the NP-MRD is interactively viewable, searchable and fully downloadable in multiple formats. Extensive hyperlinks to other databases of relevance are also provided. The NP-MRD also supports community deposition of NMR assignments and NMR spectra (1D and 2D) of natural products and related meta-data. The deposition system performs extensive data enrichment, automated data format conversion and spectral/assignment evaluation. Details of these database features, how they are implemented and plans for future upgrades are also provided. The NP-MRD is available at https://np-mrd.org.",
