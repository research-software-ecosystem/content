In the Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA), specificity is calculated by a classic probability score using an explicit model for matching experimental spectra to sequences. At default thresholds, OMSSA matches more spectra from a standard protein cocktail than a comparable algorithm. OMSSA is designed to be faster than published algorithms in searching large MS/MS datasets.","authors":["Geer L.Y.","Markey S.P.","Kowalak J.A.","Wagner L.","Xu M.","Maynard D.M.","Yang X.","Shi W.","Bryant S.H."],"cit_count":1009,"journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","pmid":"15473683","title":"Open mass spectrometry search algorithm","year":"2004-09-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:OMSSA","biotoolsID":"OMSSA","description":"The Open Mass Spectrometry Search Algorithm (OMSSA) is an efficient search engine for identifying MS/MS peptide spectra by searching libraries of known protein sequences.
