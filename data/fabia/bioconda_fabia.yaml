description: Biclustering by "Factor Analysis for Bicluster Acquisition" (FABIA).
  FABIA is a model-based technique for biclustering, that is clustering rows and columns
  simultaneously. Biclusters are found by factor analysis where both the factors and
  the loading matrix are sparse. FABIA is a multiplicative model that extracts linear
  dependencies between samples and feature patterns. It captures realistic non-Gaussian
  data distributions with heavy tails as observed in gene expression measurements.
  FABIA utilizes well understood model selection techniques like the EM algorithm
  and variational approaches and is embedded into a Bayesian framework. FABIA ranks
  biclusters according to their information content and separates spurious biclusters
  from true biclusters. The code is written in C.
