It is a multiplicative model that extracts linear dependencies between samples and feature patterns capturing realistic non-Gaussian data distributions with heavy tails as observed in gene expression measurements. Finally, it ranks biclusters according to their information content and separates spurious biclusters from true biclusters.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/fabia.html","name":"fabia","version":["2.20.0"]}}
