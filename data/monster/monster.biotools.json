The output can be viewed or downloaded as XML or text, or can be viewed as a 3D structure or a 2D diagram.  There is also a good tutorial available at the site.",

The core software, called Monster, comprises a PERL wrapper that takes advantage of scripts developed in- house as well as established software in the public domain to validate atomic coordinate files, identify interacting residues and assign the nature of these interactions. The results are assembled and presented in an intuitive and interactive graphical format. Potential applications of Monster range from mining and validating experimentally determined structures to guiding functional analysis. Non-commercial users can perform Monster analysis free of charge at http://monster.northwestern.edu. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
