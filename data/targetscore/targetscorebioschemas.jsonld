  "sc:description": "Infers the posterior distributions of microRNA targets by probabilistically modelling the likelihood microRNA-overexpression fold-changes and sequence-based scores. Variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VB-GMM) is applied to log fold-changes and sequence scores to obtain the posteriors of latent variable being the miRNA targets. The final score is computed as the sigmoid-transformed fold-change weighted by the averaged posteriors of target components over all of the features.",
