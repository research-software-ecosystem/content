Motivation: Molecular recognition of N-terminal targeting peptides is the most common mechanism controlling the import of nuclear-encoded proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts. When experimental information is lacking, computational methods can annotate targeting peptides, and determine their cleavage sites for characterizing protein localization, function, and mature protein sequences. The problem of discriminating mitochondrial from chloroplastic propeptides is particularly relevant when annotating proteomes of photosynthetic Eukaryotes, endowed with both types of sequences. Results: Here, we introduce TPpred3, a computational method that given any Eukaryotic protein sequence performs three different tasks: (i) the detection of targeting peptides; (ii) their classification as mitochondrial or chloroplastic and (iii) the precise localization of the cleavage sites in an organelle-specific framework. Our implementation is based on our TPpred previously introduced. Here, we integrate a new N-to-1 Extreme Learning Machine specifically designed for the classification task (ii). For the last task, we introduce an organelle-specific Support Vector Machine that exploits sequence motifs retrieved with an extensive motif-discovery analysis of a large set of mitochondrial and chloroplastic proteins. We show that TPpred3 outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all the three tasks.",

            "abstract": "Motivation: Targeting peptides are the most important signal controlling the import of nuclear encoded proteins into mitochondria and plastids. In the lack of experimental information, their prediction is an essential step when proteomes are annotated for inferring both the localization and the sequence of mature proteins.Results: We developed TPpred a new predictor of organelle-targeting peptides based on Grammatical-Restrained Hidden Conditional Random Fields. TPpred is trained on a non-redundant dataset of proteins where the presence of a target peptide was experimentally validated, comprising 297 sequences. When tested on the 297 positive and some other 8010 negative examples, TPpred outperformed available methods in both accuracy and Matthews correlation index (96% and 0.58, respectively). Given its very low-false-positive rate (3.0%), TPpred is, therefore, well suited for large-scale analyses at the proteome level. We predicted that from ∼4 to 9% of the sequences of human, Arabidopsis thaliana and yeast proteomes contain targeting peptides and are, therefore, likely to be localized in mitochondria and plastids. TPpred predictions correlate to a good extent with the experimental annotation of the subcellular localization, when available. TPpred was also trained and tested to predict the cleavage site of the organelle-targeting peptide: on this task, the average error of TPpred on mitochondrial and plastidic proteins is 7 and 15 residues, respectively. This value is lower than the error reported by other methods currently available. © 2013 The Author.",

CONTACT: gigi@biocomp.unibo.it SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. SUMMARY: Targeting peptides are N-terminal sorting signals in proteins that promote their translocation to mitochondria through the interaction with different protein machineries. We recently developed TPpred, a machine learning-based method scoring among the best ones available to predict the presence of a targeting peptide into a protein sequence and its cleavage site. Here we introduce TPpred2 that improves TPpred performances in the task of identifying the cleavage site of the targeting peptides. TPpred2 is now available as a web interface and as a stand-alone version for users who can freely download and adopt it for processing large volumes of sequences. Availability and implementaion: TPpred2 is available both as web server and stand-alone version at http://tppred2.biocomp.unibo.it.",
