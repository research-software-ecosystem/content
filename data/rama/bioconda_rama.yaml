description: Robust estimation of cDNA microarray intensities with replicates. The
  package uses a Bayesian hierarchical model for the robust estimation. Outliers are
  modeled explicitly using a t-distribution, and the model also addresses classical
  issues such as design effects, normalization, transformation, and nonconstant variance.
