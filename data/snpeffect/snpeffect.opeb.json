Linking structural effects of non-synonymous SNVs to functional outcomes is a major issue in structural bioinformatics. The SNPeffect database (http://snpeffect.switchlab.org) uses sequenceand structure-based bioinformatics tools to predict the effect of protein-coding SNVs on the structural phenotype of proteins. It integrates aggregation prediction (TANGO), amyloid prediction (WALTZ), chaperone-binding prediction (LIMBO) and protein stability analysis (FoldX) for structural phenotyping. Additionally, SNPeffect holds information on affected catalytic sites and a number of posttranslational modifications. The database contains all known human protein variants from UniProt, but users can now also submit custom protein variants for a SNPeffect analysis, including automated structure modeling. The new meta-analysis application allows plotting correlations between phenotypic features for a user-selected set of variants. © The Author(s) 2011.","authors":["De Baets G.","Van Durme J.","Reumers J.","Maurer-Stroh S.","Vanhee P.","Dopazo J.","Schymkowitz J.","Rousseau F."],"cit_count":119,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22075996","title":"SNPeffect 4.0: On-line prediction of molecular and structural effects of protein-coding variants","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snpeffect","biotoolsID":"snpeffect","description":"This database uses sequence- and structure-based bioinformatics tools to predict the effect of protein-coding SNVs on the structural phenotype of proteins.","homepage":"http://snpeffect.switchlab.org/","name":"SNPeffect"}}
