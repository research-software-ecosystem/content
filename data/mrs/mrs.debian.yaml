  description: Information Retrieval System for Biomedical databanks
  long_description: " MRS is a complete system to retrieve, index and query biological
    and\n medical databanks. It comes with all the code required to fetch data\n using
    FTP or rsync, then creates a local databank with indices using\n a databank specific
    parser written in Perl. It can then serve this\n data using a built-in web application
    and webservices.\n .\n Searching can be done on words and Boolean queries. As
    a bonus you\n can search protein sequences using a custom Blast algorithm."
