summary: Information Retrieval System for Biomedical databanks
description: >
   MRS is a complete system to retrieve, index and query biological and
   medical databanks. It comes with all the code required to fetch data
   using FTP or rsync, then creates a local databank with indices using
   a databank specific parser written in Perl. It can then serve this
   data using a built-in web application and webservices.
   .
   Searching can be done on words and Boolean queries. As a bonus you
   can search protein sequences using a custom Blast algorithm.
