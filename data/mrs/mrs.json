MRS indexes several flat-file data sets for searching, including  EMBL nucleotide, UniProt, PDB and KEGG.  Searches can be performed globally, or on one or more flat file fields per data set.",

The MRS server allows for very rapid queries in a large number of flat-file data banks, such as EMBL, UniProt, OMIM, dbEST, PDB, KEGG, etc. This server combines a fast and reliable backend with a very user-friendly implementation of all the commonly used information retrieval facilities. The MRS server is freely accessible at http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/. Moreover, the MRS software is freely available at http://mrs.cmbi.ru.nl/download/ for those interested in making their own data banks available via a web-based server. \u00a9 2005 Oxford University Press.",
