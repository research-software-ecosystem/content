Here, we show that mRNAs that contain Pumilio recognition elements (PRE) in the proximity of predicted miRNA-binding sites are more likely to form stable secondary structures within their 3\u2032-UTR, and we demonstrated using a PUM1 and PUM2 double knockdown that Pumilio proteins are general regulators of miRNA accessibility. On the basis of these findings, we developed a computational method for predicting miRNA targets that accounts for the presence of PRE in the proximity of seed-match sequences within poorly accessible structures. Moreover, we implement the miRNA-MRE duplex pairing as a two-step model, which better fits the available structural data. This algorithm, called MREdictor, allows for the identification of miRNA targets in poorly accessible regions and is not restricted to a perfect seed-match; these features are not present in other computational prediction methods. \u00a9 2013 The Author(s).
