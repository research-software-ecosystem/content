description: NetPathMiner is a general framework for network path mining using genome-scale
  networks. It constructs networks from KGML, SBML and BioPAX files, providing three
  network representations, metabolic, reaction and gene representations. NetPathMiner
  finds active paths and applies machine learning methods to summarize found paths
  for easy interpretation. It also provides static and interactive visualizations
  of networks and paths to aid manual investigation.
