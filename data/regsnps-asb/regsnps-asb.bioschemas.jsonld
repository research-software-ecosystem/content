      "sc:description": "A Computational Framework for Identifying Allele-Specific Transcription Factor Binding From ATAC-seq Data.\n\nExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is useful for identifying genetic variants correlated with gene expression, however, it cannot distinguish between causal and nearby non-functional variants. Because the majority of disease-associated SNPs are located in regulatory regions, they can impact allele-specific binding (ASB) of transcription factors and result in differential expression of the target gene alleles. In this study, our aim was to identify functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that alter transcriptional regulation and thus, potentially impact cellular function. Here, we present regSNPs-ASB, a generalized linear model-based approach to identify regulatory SNPs that are located in transcription factor binding sites",
