      "sc:description": "EView is an on-line platform for 3D electric field simulation in electroporation-based treatments using needle-shaped electrodes. EView provides an easy way to obtain approximate estimations of the electric field distribution for arbitrary electrode positions and orientations. EView has been developed with the aim of facilitating the understanding of how the electric field distribution depends on the geometry of the electrode setup and the applied voltage.",
