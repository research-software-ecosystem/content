description: BRIG can display circular comparisons between a large number of genomes,
  with a focus on handling genome assembly data. * Images show similarity between
  a central reference sequence and other sequences as concentric rings. * BRIG will
  perform all BLAST comparisons and file parsing automatically via a simple GUI. *
  Contig boundaries and read coverage can be displayed for draft genomes; customized
  graphs and annotations can be displayed. * Using a user-defined set of genes as
  input, BRIG can display gene presence, absence, truncation or sequence variation
  in a set of complete genomes, draft genomes or even raw, unassembled sequence data.
  * BRIG also accepts SAM-formatted read-mapping files enabling genomic regions present
  in unassembled sequence data from multiple samples to be compared simultaneously
