description: "FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees\
  \ from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. It handles alignments with\
  \ up to a million of sequences in a reasonable amount of time and memory. For large\
  \ alignments, FastTree is 100-1,000 times faster than PhyML 3.0 or RAxML 7. . FastTree\
  \ is more accurate than PhyML 3 with default settings, and much more accurate than\
  \ the distance-matrix methods that are traditionally used for large alignments.\
  \ FastTree uses the Jukes-Cantor or generalized time-reversible (GTR) models of\
  \ nucleotide evolution and the JTT (Jones-Taylor-Thornton 1992) model of amino acid\
  \ evolution. To account for the varying rates of evolution across sites, FastTree\
  \ uses a single rate for each site (the \"CAT\" approximation). To quickly estimate\
  \ the reliability of each split in the tree, FastTree computes local support values\
  \ with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (these are the same as PhyML 3's \"SH-like local\
  \ supports\"). . This package contains a single threaded version (fasttree) and\
  \ a parallel version which uses OpenMP (fasttreMP).\n"
