summary: phylogenetic trees from alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences
description: >
   FastTree infers approximately-maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees from
   alignments of nucleotide or protein sequences. It handles alignments
   with up to a million of sequences in a reasonable amount of time and
   memory. For large alignments, FastTree is 100-1,000 times faster than
   PhyML 3.0 or RAxML 7.
   .
   FastTree is more accurate than PhyML 3 with default settings, and much
   more accurate than the distance-matrix methods that are traditionally
   used for large alignments. FastTree uses the Jukes-Cantor or generalized
   time-reversible (GTR) models of nucleotide evolution and the JTT
   (Jones-Taylor-Thornton 1992) model of amino acid evolution. To account
   for the varying rates of evolution across sites, FastTree uses a single
   rate for each site (the "CAT" approximation). To quickly estimate the
   reliability of each split in the tree, FastTree computes local support
   values with the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (these are the same as PhyML 3's
   "SH-like local supports").
   .
   This package contains a single threaded version (fasttree) and a
   parallel version which uses OpenMP (fasttreMP).
