    "description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'PoO', 'PoOxE', 'triads', 'lip' | A genome-wide scan of cleft lip triads identifies parent-of-origin interaction effects between ANK3 and maternal smoking, and between ARHGEF10 and alcohol consumption | Background: Although both genetic and environmental factors have been reported to influence the risk of isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL P), the exact mechanisms behind CL P are still largely unaccounted for. We recently developed new methods to identify parent-of-origin (PoO) interactions with environmental exposures (PoOxE) and applied them to families with children born with isolated cleft palate only. Here, we used the same genome-wide association study (GWAS) dataset and methodology to screen for PoOxE effects in the larger sample of CL P triads",
