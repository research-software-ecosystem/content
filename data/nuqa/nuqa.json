    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | Estimating cancer spatial and temporal heterogeneity and evolution through alignment-free methods | NGS tool for Unsupervised analysis of fastQ files using Alignment-free | A software to support an alignment-free sequence comparison of large-scale fastq files using a k-mer counting methods paired with distance metrics, Jensen-Shannon divergence and Hellinger Distance | git clone https://github.com/ARoddy/NUQA.git | NUQA reads in a set of raw fastq files - ideally, these are DNA-seq files produced from multiple samples taken from the same patient. Based on these it will identify differences between the files and produce a distance matrix and a newick tree file | Eigen (where /Eigen file containing the headers is located at /usr/local/include for an example run check file 'Eigen_help.txt')",
