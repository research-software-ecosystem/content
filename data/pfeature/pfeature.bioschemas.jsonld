Following are main menus for computing features; i) Composition-based features, ii) Binary profile of sequences, iii) evolutionary information based features, iv) structural descriptors, v) pattern based descriptors, and vi) model building, for a group of protein/peptide sequences. Additionally, users will also be able to generate these features for sub-parts of protein/peptide sequences. Pfeature be helpful to annotate structure, function and therapeutic properties of proteins/peptides.",
