description: Program for visualizing annotations of genomic sequences. the program
  takes the annotated features on a genomic sequence in gff format as input, and produces
  a visual output in postscript. while it can be used in a very simple way, it also
  allows for a great degree of customization through a number of options and/or customization
  files.
