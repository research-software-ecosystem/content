summary: produces PostScript graphical output from GFF-files
description: >
   gff2ps is a script program developed with the aim of converting gff-formatted
   records into high quality one-dimensional plots in PostScript. Such plots
   maybe useful for comparing genomic structures and to visualizing outputs from
   genome annotation programs.
   It can be used in a very simple way, because it assumes that the GFF file
   itself carries enough formatting information, but it also allows through a
   number of options and/or a configuration file, for a great degree of
   customization.
