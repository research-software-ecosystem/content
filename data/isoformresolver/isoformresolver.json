Unresolved questions include whether to show all possible proteins vs a minimal list, what to do when proteins are inferred ambiguously, and how to quantify peptides that bridge multiple proteins, each with distinguishing evidence. Here we describe IsoformResolver, a peptide-centric protein inference algorithm that clusters proteins in two ways, one based on peptides experimentally identified from MS/MS spectra, and the other based on peptides derived from an in silico digest of the protein database. MS/MS-derived protein groups report minimal list proteins in the context of all possible proteins, without redundantly listing peptides. In silico-derived protein groups pull together functionally related proteins, providing stable identifiers. The peptide-centric grouping strategy used by IsoformResolver allows proteins to be displayed together when they share peptides in common, providing a comprehensive yet concise way to organize protein profiles. It also summarizes information on spectral counts and is especially useful for comparing results from multiple LC-MS/MS experiments. Finally, we examine the relatedness of proteins within IsoformResolver groups and compare its performance to other protein inference software. \u00a9 2011 American Chemical Society.", "citationCount": 31, "authors": [{"name": "Meyer-Arendt K."}, {"name": "Old W.M."}, {"name": "Houel S."}, {"name": "Renganathan K."}, {"name": "Eichelberger B."}, {"name": "Resing K.A."}, {"name": "Ahn N.G."}], "date": "2011-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Proteome Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Natalie Ahn", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "natlie.ahn@colorado.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:isoformresolver", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3167374/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein identification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3767"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:20:25Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A peptide-centric algorithm for protein inference.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "isoformresolver", "additionDate": "2018-03-13T20:40:37Z", "name": "IsoformResolver", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
