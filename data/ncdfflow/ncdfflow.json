Automation, standardization, reproducibility have become requirements for qualitative research. The Bioconductor community has worked in that direction proposing several R packages to handle high-throughput data including flow cytometry (FCM) experiment. Altogether, these packages cover the main steps of a FCM analysis workflow, that is, data management, quality assessment, normalization, outlier detection, automated gating, cluster labeling, and feature extraction. Additionally, the open-source philosophy of R and Bioconductor, which offers room for new development, continuously drives research and improvement of theses analysis methods, especially in the field of clustering and data mining. This review presents the principal FCM packages currently available in R and Bioconductor, their advantages and their limits. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.", "citationCount": 11, "authors": [{"name": "Le Meur N."}], "date": "2013-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Current Opinion in Biotechnology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Mike Jiang", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "wjiang2@fhcrc.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ncdfflow", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.20.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ncdfFlow.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2990"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Provides HDF5 storage based methods and functions for manipulation of flow cytometry data.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "ncdfflow", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:03:05Z", "name": "ncdfFlow", "license": "Artistic-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ncdfFlow.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
