description: Pscan finds Over-represented Transcription Factor Binding Site Motifs
  in Sequences from Co-Regulated or Co-Expressed Genes. . Pscan is a software tool
  that scans a set of sequences (e.g. promoters) from co-regulated or co-expressed
  genes with motifs describing the binding specificity of known transcription factors
  and assesses which motifs are significantly over- or under-represented, providing
  thus hints on which transcription factors could be common regulators of the genes
  studied, together with the location of their candidate binding sites in the sequences.
  Pscan does not resort to comparisons with orthologous sequences and experimental
  results show that it compares favorably to other tools for the same task in terms
  of false positive predictions and computation time. The website is free and open
  to all users and there is no login requirement.
