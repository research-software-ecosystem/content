This web application employs a logistic regression classifier that integrates existing, proven APMS scoring approaches (SAINT, CompPASS, and HGSCore), gene co-expression patterns, functional annotations, domain-domain binding affinity, and homologous interactions, which we have shown outperforms existing APMS scoring methods.",
