description: idpr aims to integrate tools for the computational analysis of intrinsically
  disordered proteins (IDPs) within R. This package is used to identify known characteristics
  of IDPs for a sequence of interest with easily reported and dynamic results. Additionally,
  this package includes tools for IDP-based sequence analysis to be used in conjunction
  with other R packages.
