De novo peptide sequencing can identify mutations, unexpected modifications and novel peptides. pNovo is a de novo peptide sequencing tool, which has been updated with multiple versions (e.g., pNovo and pNovo+) | Database search has long been the dominant approach to peptide and protein identification. Many database search algorithms are used in the routine proteome analysis, such as pFind, Mascot, SEQUEST, PEAKS DB. Generally, the essence of these methods is retrieving all candidate peptides from a specified database for each spectrum, which also means that a protein database is indispensable",
