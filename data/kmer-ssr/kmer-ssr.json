Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Motivation: One of the main challenges with bioinformatics software is that the size and complexity of datasets necessitate trading speed for accuracy, or completeness. To combat this problem of computational complexity, a plethora of heuristic algorithms have arisen that report a 'good enough' solution to biological questions. However, in instances such as Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs), a 'good enough' solution may not accurately portray results in population genetics, phylogenetics and forensics, which require accurate SSRs to calculate intra- and inter-species interactions. Results: We present Kmer-SSR, which finds all SSRs faster than most heuristic SSR identification algorithms in a parallelized, easy-to-use manner. The exhaustive Kmer-SSR option has 100% precision and 100% recall and accurately identifies every SSR of any specified length. To identify more biologically pertinent SSRs, we also developed several filters that allow users to easily view a subset of SSRs based on user input. Kmer-SSR, coupled with the filter options, accurately and intuitively identifies SSRs quickly and in a more user-friendly manner than any other SSR identification algorithm.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Pickett B.D."}, {"name": "Miller J.B."}, {"name": "Ridge P.G."}], "date": "2017-12-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Perry Ridge", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "perry.ridge@byu.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:kmer-ssr", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/ridgelab/Kmer-SSR", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Repeat sequence detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0379"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Fast, Accurate, and Complete SSR Detection in Genomic Sequences.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "kmer-ssr", "additionDate": "2018-06-18T18:25:30Z", "name": "Kmer-SSR", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/ridgelab/Kmer-SSR", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
