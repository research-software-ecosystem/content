Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. More than 150 peptide therapeutics are globally in clinical development. Many enzymatic barriers should be crossed by a successful drug to be prosperous in such a process. Therefore, the new peptide drugs must be designed preventing the potential protease cleavage to make the compound less susceptible to protease reaction. We present a new data analysis tool developed in WebMetabase, an approach that stores the information from liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-based experimental data or from external sources such as the MEROPS database. The tool is a chemically aware system where each peptide substrate is presented as a sequence of structural blocks (SBs) connected by amide bonds and not being limited to the natural amino acids. Each SB is characterized by its pharmacophoric and physicochemical properties including a similarity score that describes likelihood between a SB and each one of the other SBs in the database. This methodology can be used to perform a frequency analysis to discover the most frequent cleavage sites for similar amide bonds, defined based on the similarity of the SB that participate in such a bond within the experimentally derived and/or public database.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Radchenko T."}, {"name": "Fontaine F."}, {"name": "Morettoni L."}, {"name": "Zamora I."}], "date": "2019-02-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": [], "name": "Tatiana Radchenko", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": null, "email": "tatiana.radchenko01@estudiant.upf.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:WebMetabase", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://webmetabase.com:8182/WebMetabaseBioinformatics/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Enrichment analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3501"}, {"term": "Natural product identification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3803"}, {"term": "Scaffolding", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3216"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-07-06T06:43:07Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Cleavage sites analysis tool for natural and unnatural substrates from diverse data source.", "toolType": ["Web application", "Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "WebMetabase", "additionDate": "2019-07-06T06:42:54Z", "name": "WebMetabase", "license": "Other", "documentation": [{"url": "http://webmetabase.com:8182/WebMetabaseBioinformatics/manual/WebMetabaseManual.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
