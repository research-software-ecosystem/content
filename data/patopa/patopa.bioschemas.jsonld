      "sc:description": "A probabilistic method for leveraging functional annotations to enhance estimation of the temporal order of pathway mutations during carcinogenesis.\n\n“rectal_table”: All the nonsynonymous mutations in TCGA rectal cancer dataset and its coresponding Polyphen-2 scores. The first column is the sample names, the second column is the mutated genes and the third column is the functional impact score corresponding to each mutations.\n\n“CoreGroup2Gene.txt”: contains the mapping of pathways to genes (genes entrez id). The first column is the name of pathways, the second column is genes included in the pathways.\n\nThe file \"example1.R” is an example of R codes which read the data file “rectal_table” and “CoreGroup2Gene.txt” and analyze the 9 pathways in “CoreGroup2Gene.txt” together. The file returns “pairprob.txt” which contains the probabilities of A>B, A<B and A=B for all pairs of pathways.",
