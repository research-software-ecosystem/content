      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'omicssimla' | a profile-based whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data simulator incorporating methylation QTLs, allele-specific methylations and differentially methylated regions | MOTIVATION:DNA methylation plays an important role in regulating gene expression. DNA methylation is commonly analyzed using bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq)-based designs, such as whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS), and oxidative bisulfite sequencing (oxBS-seq). Furthermore, there has been growing interest in investigating the roles that genetic variants play in changing the methylation levels (i.e., methylation quantitative trait loci or meQTLs), how methylation regulates the imprinting of gene expression (i.e., allele-specific methylation or ASM), and the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) among different cell types",
