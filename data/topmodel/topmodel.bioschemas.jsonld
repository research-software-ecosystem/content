      "sc:description": "Template-Based Protein Structure Prediction at Low Sequence Identity Using Top-Down Consensus and Deep Neural Networks.\n\nKnowledge of protein structures is essential to understand proteins' functions, evolution, dynamics, stabilities, and interactions and for data-driven protein- or drug design. Yet, experimental structure determination rates are far exceeded by that of next-generation sequencing, resulting in less than 1 1000th of proteins having an experimentally known 3D structure. Computational structure prediction seeks to alleviate this problem, and the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) has shown the value of consensus and meta-methods that utilize complementary algorithms. However, traditionally, such methods employ majority voting during template selection and model averaging during refinement, which can drive the model away from the native fold if it is underrepresented in the ensemble",
