Our pipeline initially constructs a diploid personal genome sequence (and corresponding personalized gene annotation) using genomic sequence variants (SNPs, indels, and structural variants), and then identifies allele-specific events with significant differences in the number of mapped reads between maternal and paternal alleles. There are many technical challenges in the construction and alignment of reads to a personal diploid genome sequence that we address, for example, bias of reads mapping to the reference allele. We have applied AlleleSeq to variation data for NA12878 from the 1000 Genomes Project as well as matched, deeply sequenced RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data sets generated for this purpose. In addition to observing fairly widespread allele-specific behavior within individual functional genomic data sets (including results consistent with X-chromosome inactivation), we can study the interaction between ASE and ASB. Furthermore, we investigate the coordination between ASE and ASB from multiple transcription factors events using a regulatory network framework. Correlation analyses and network motifs show mostly coordinated ASB and ASE. \u00a9 2011 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited.", "citationCount": 152, "authors": [{"name": "Rozowsky J."}, {"name": "Abyzov A."}, {"name": "Wang J."}, {"name": "Alves P."}, {"name": "Raha D."}, {"name": "Harmanci A."}, {"name": "Leng J."}, {"name": "Bjornson R."}, {"name": "Kong Y."}, {"name": "Kitabayashi N."}, {"name": "Bhardwaj N."}, {"name": "Rubin M."}, {"name": "Snyder M."}, {"name": "Gerstein M."}], "date": "2011-08-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Molecular Systems Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.gersteinlab.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "adminasst@gersteinlab.org"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:vcf2diploid", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://alleleseq.gersteinlab.org/tools.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence profile generation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0296"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A personal genome constructor, it can be used to construct a personal diploid genome sequence by including personal variants into reference genome.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C++"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/vcf2diploid-0-2-3-personal-genome-constructor.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "vcf2diploid", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:08:38Z", "name": "vcf2diploid", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://info.gersteinlab.org/AlleleSeq#vcf2diploid", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
