description: ChIP-Seq is widely used to characterize genome-wide binding patterns
  of transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins. Although comparison
  of ChIP-Seq data sets is critical for understanding cell type-dependent and cell
  state-specific binding, and thus the study of cell-specific gene regulation, few
  quantitative approaches have been developed. Here, we present a simple and effective
  method, MAnorm, for quantitative comparison of ChIP-Seq data sets describing transcription
  factor binding sites and epigenetic modifications. The quantitative binding differences
  inferred by MAnorm showed strong correlation with both the changes in expression
  of target genes and the binding of cell type-specific regulators.
