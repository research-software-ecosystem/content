description: Seq2hla is a computational tool to determine human leukocyte antigen
  (hla) directly from existing and future short rna-seq reads. it takes standard rna-seq
  sequence reads in fastq format as input, uses a bowtie index comprising known hla
  alleles and outputs the most likely hla class i and class ii types, a p-value for
  each call, and the expression of each class."
