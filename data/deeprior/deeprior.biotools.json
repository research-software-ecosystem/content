    "description": "DEEPrior is an inherently flexible deep learning tool that predicts the probability of a gene fusion being a driver of an oncogenic process, by directly exploiting the amino acid sequence of the fused protein and it is able to prioritize gene fusions from different tumors. Unlike state of the art tools, it also support easy retraining and re-adaptation of the model.",

However, the problem of determining whether a gene fusion is a cancer driver or just a passenger mutation is still an open issue. Here we present DEEPrior, an inherently flexible deep learning tool with two modes (Inference and Retraining). Inference mode predicts the probability of a gene fusion being involved in an oncogenic process, by directly exploiting the amino acid sequence of the fused protein. Retraining mode allows to obtain a custom prediction model including new data provided by the user.",
