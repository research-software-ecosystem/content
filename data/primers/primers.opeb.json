Macroinvertebrates are an ideal group for Environmental Impacts Assessment (EIA). However, generating accurate macroinvertebrate inventories is difficult and error-prone based on larval morphology. Here, DNA metabarcoding provides new opportunities. Its potential to accurately identify bulk invertebrates on species level has been demonstrated in several case studies. However, DNA based identification is often limited by primer bias, potentially leading to taxa in the sample remaining undetected. Thus, the success of DNA metabarcoding as an emerging technique for EIA critically relies on carefully evaluated primers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'metabarcoding', 'PrimerMiner', 'mock'","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.2044V3","name":"primers"}}
