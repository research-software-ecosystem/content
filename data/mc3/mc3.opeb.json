Models are developed either through augmentations of existing models or more recently through automatic reconstruction tools. There is currently no standardized practice or method for validating the properties of a model before placing it in the public domain. Considerable effort is often required to understand a model's inconsistencies before its reuse within new research efforts.Results: We present a review of common issues in stoichiometric models typically uncovered during pathway analysis and constraint-based optimization, and we detail succinct and efficient ways to find them. We present MC3, Model and Constraint Consistency Checker, a computational tool that can be used for two purposes: (a) identifying potential connectivity and topological issues for a given stoichiometric matrix, S, and (b) flagging issues that arise during constraint-based optimization. The MC3 tool includes three distinct checking components. The first examines the results of computing the basis for the null space for Sv = 0; the second uses connectivity analysis; and the third utilizes Flux Variability Analysis. MC3 takes as input a stoichiometric matrix and flux constraints, and generates a report summarizing issues.Conclusions: We report the results of applying MC3 to published models for several systems including Escherichia coli, an adipocyte cell, a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, and Leishmania major. Several issues with no prior documentation are identified. MC3 provides a standalone MATLAB-based comprehensive tool for model validation, a task currently performed either ad hoc or implemented in part within other computational tools. © 2013 Yousofshahi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Yousofshahi M.","Ullah E.","Stern R.","Hassoun S."],"cit_count":6,"doi":"10.1186/1752-0509-7-129","journal":"BMC Systems Biology","title":"MC3: A steady-state model and constraint consistency checker for biochemical networks","year":"2013-11-21"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:mc3","biotoolsID":"mc3","description":"Steady-state Model and Constraint Consistency Checker for biochemical networks.","homepage":"https://github.com/sohahassoun/mc3","name":"MC3"}}
