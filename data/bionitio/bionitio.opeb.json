It can be used as a basis for learning and as a solid foundation for starting new projects. We provide a script called bionitio-boot.sh for starting new projects from bionitio, which saves time and ensures good programming practices are adopted from the beginning (see below for details)","homepage":"https://github.com/bionitio-team/bionitio","name":"Bionitio"}}
