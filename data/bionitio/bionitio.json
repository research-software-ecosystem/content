    "description": "demonstrating and facilitating best practices for bioinformatics command-line software | Demonstrating best practices for bioinformatics command line tools | Bionitio provides a template for command line bioinformatics tools in various programming languages | The purpose of the tool is to provide an easy-to-understand working example that is built on best-practice software engineering principles. It can be used as a basis for learning and as a solid foundation for starting new projects. We provide a script called bionitio-boot.sh for starting new projects from bionitio, which saves time and ensures good programming practices are adopted from the beginning (see below for details)",
