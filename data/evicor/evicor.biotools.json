To address these issues, we introduce EviCor, a handy toolbox for exploration of data from large public resources such as The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, complemented with follow-up information on same samples, which couples omics datasets with drug response profiles (https://www.evicor.org/). The data was processed for easy retrieval from the server-side database and includes pre-computed drug-feature correlation tables. Using information from multiple independent sources, the task-oriented web interface presents relations between phenotype, single-molecule, and pathway variables with graphical, statistical, and network analysis tools. Building custom multivariate models is enabled via user-friendly web interface and programmatic access via RESTinterface. Project code is available at https://github.com/aveviort/HyperSet.",
