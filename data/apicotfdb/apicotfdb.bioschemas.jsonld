      "sc:description": "The comprehensive web repository of apicomplexan transcription factors and transcription-associated co-factors | Despite significant progress in apicomplexan genome sequencing and genomics, the current list of experimentally validated transcription factors (TFs) in these genomes is incomplete and mainly consists of AP2 family of proteins, with only a limited number of non-AP2 family TFs and transcription-associated co-factors (TcoFs). We have performed a systematic bioinformatics-aided prediction of TFs and TcoFs in apicomplexan genomes and developed the ApicoTFdb database which consists of experimentally validated as well as computationally predicted TFs and TcoFs in 14 apicomplexan species. The predicted TFs are manually curated to complement the existing annotations. The current version of the database includes 1292 TFs which includes experimentally validated and computationally predicted TFs, representing 20 distinct families across 14 apicomplexan species",
