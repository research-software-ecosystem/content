      "sc:description": "Identifying Cooperating miRNAs via Kernel Based Interaction Tests.\n\nAlthough miRNAs can cause widespread changes in expression programs, single miRNAs typically induce mild repression on their targets. Cooperativity among miRNAs is reported as one strategy to overcome this constraint. Expanding the catalog of synergistic miRNAs is critical for understanding gene regulation and for developing miRNA-based therapeutics. In this study, we develop miRCoop to identify synergistic miRNA pairs that have weak or no repression on the target mRNA individually, but when act together induce strong repression. miRCoop uses kernel-based statistical interaction tests, together with miRNA and mRNA target information. We apply our approach to patient data of two different cancer types. In kidney cancer, we identify 66 putative triplets",
