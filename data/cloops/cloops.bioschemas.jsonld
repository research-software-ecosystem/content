      "sc:description": "Accurate loop calling for 3D genomic data with cLoops | Accurate and flexible loops calling tool for 3D genomic data | cLoops: loop-calling for ChIA-PET, Hi-C, HiChIP and Trac-looping | Chromosome conformation capture (3C) derived high-throughput sequencing methods such as ChIA-PET,HiChIP and Hi-C provide genome-wide view of chromatin organization. Fine scale loops formed by interactions of regulatory elements spanning hundreds kilobases can be detected from these data. Here we introduce cLoops ('see loops'),a common loops calling tool for ChIA-PET, HiChIP and high-resolution Hi-C data. Paired-end tags (PETs) are first classified as self-ligation and inter-ligation clusters using an optimized unsupervisied clustering algorithm. The significances of the inter-ligation clusters are then estimated using permutated local background",
