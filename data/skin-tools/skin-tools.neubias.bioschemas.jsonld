  "http://schema.org/description": "The skin tools measure the thickness of the epidermis and the interdigitation index. \r\n\r\nThe input images are masks that represent the epidermis and that have been created from images of stained histological sections. The mask must touch the left and right border of the image. The dermal-epidermal border must be on the lower site of the image. The interdigitation index can be measured for one or more segments per image. As a measure of the thickness of the epidermis the lengths of a number of random line segments are measured. The line segments start at the lower border, are perpendicular to the lower border and end at the opposite border of the mask.\r\n\r\nSee installation Instructions on the website.\r\n",
