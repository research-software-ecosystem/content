We present MiDAS, an R package enabling statistical association analysis and using immunogenetic data transformation functions for HLA amino acid fine mapping, analysis of HLA evolutionary divergence as well as HLA-KIR interactions. MiDAS closes the gap between inference of immunogenetic variation and its efficient utilization to make meaningful discoveries.",
