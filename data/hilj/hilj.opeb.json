This editorial examines the progression of HILJ Club, an online journal club, from an idea to the launch of a dedicated platform. One article is selected per issue of the Health Information and Libraries Journal with an open discussion invited following a brief summary and reflections by a host. Participation in HILJ Club is growing. Future success is reliant on wider engagement, and an invitation is extended to join in the discussions or even host an edition.","authors":["Fricker A.","Roper T."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1111/HIR.12288","journal":"Health Information and Libraries Journal","pmid":"31829504","title":"An open invitation to join HILJ [Journal] Club","year":"2019-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:HILJ","biotoolsID":"HILJ","description":"An open invitation to join HILJ [Journal] Club.\n\nAccess to Health Information and Libraries Journal (HILJ).\n\nHILJ CPD reading Volume 35 No 3 – Developing a generic tool to routinely measure the impact of health libraries.\n\nHILJ CPD Reading vol 35 no 3 – Localising and tailoring research evidence helps public health decision making. – Health librarian and info skills trainer.\n\nHILJ Club – Read articles – talk about them.\n\nAs an HLG member you can access the Journal here.\n\nWelcome to the second experimental online reading group aimed at encouraging discussion of interesting articles in HILJ.
