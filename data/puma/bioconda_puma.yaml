description: Most analyses of Affymetrix GeneChip data (including tranditional 3'
  arrays and exon arrays and Human Transcriptome Array 2.0) are based on point estimates
  of expression levels and ignore the uncertainty of such estimates. By propagating
  uncertainty to downstream analyses we can improve results from microarray analyses.
  For the first time, the puma package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation methods
  available to a general audience. In additon to calculte gene expression from Affymetrix
  3' arrays, puma also provides methods to process exon arrays and produces gene and
  isoform expression for alternative splicing study. puma also offers improvements
  in terms of scope and speed of execution over previously available uncertainty propagation
  methods. Included are summarisation, differential expression detection, clustering
  and PCA methods, together with useful plotting functions.
