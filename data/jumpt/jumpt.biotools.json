    "description": "JUMPt (JUMP-turnover) software determines the protein turnover rates in pulse SILAC labeled animals using mass spectrometry (MS) data. JUMPt uses a novel differential equation-based mathematical model to calculate the reliable and accurate protein turnover rates. The proposed method calculates the half-life of individual proteins by fitting the dynamic data of unlabeled free Lys and protein-bound Lys from individual proteins simultaneously.",

                "abstract": "Recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics allow the measurement of turnover rates of thousands of proteins using dynamic labeling methods, such as pulse stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (pSILAC). However, when applying the pSILAC strategy to multicellular animals (e.g., mice), the labeling process is significantly delayed by native amino acids recycled from protein degradation in vivo, raising a challenge of defining accurate protein turnover rates. Here, we report JUMPt, a software package using a novel ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based mathematical model to determine reliable rates of protein degradation. The uniqueness of JUMPt is to consider amino acid recycling and fit the kinetics of the labeling amino acid (e.g., Lys) and whole proteome simultaneously to derive half-lives of individual proteins. Multiple settings in the software are designed to enable simple to comprehensive data inputs for precise analysis of half-lives with flexibility. We examined the software by studying the turnover of thousands of proteins in the pSILAC brain and liver tissues. The results were largely consistent with the proteome turnover measurements from previous studies. The long-lived proteins are enriched in the integral membrane, myelin sheath, and mitochondrion in the brain. In summary, the ODE-based JUMPt software is an effective proteomics tool for analyzing large-scale protein turnover, and the software is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/JUMPSuite/JUMPt) to the research community.",
