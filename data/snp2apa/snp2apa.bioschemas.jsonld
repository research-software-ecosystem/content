      "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | a database for evaluating effects of genetic variants on alternative polyadenylation in human cancers | Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is an important post-transcriptional regulation that recognizes different polyadenylation signals (PASs), resulting in transcripts with different 3' untranslated regions, thereby influencing a series of biological processes and functions. Recent studies have revealed that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) could contribute to tumorigenesis and development through dysregulating APA. However, the associations between SNPs and APA in human cancers remain largely unknown. Here, using genotype and APA data of 9082 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer 3'UTR Altas (TC3A), we systematically identified SNPs affecting APA events across 32 cancer types and defined them as APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs). As a result, a total of 467 942 cis-apaQTLs and 30 721 trans-apaQTLs were identified",
