It is a data-driven Hi-C data simulator for simulating and augmenting Hi-C datasets. FreeHi-C employs a non-parametric strategy for estimating an interaction distribution of genome fragments and simulates Hi-C reads from interacting fragments. Data from FreeHi-C exhibit higher fidelity to the biological Hi-C data. FreeHi-C not only can be used to study and benchmark a wide range of Hi-C analysis methods but also boosts power and enables false discovery rate control for differential interaction detection algorithms through data augmentation","homepage":"https://github.com/keleslab/FreeHiC","name":"FreeHi-C"}}
