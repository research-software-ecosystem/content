Although comparison of RNA-protein interaction profiles across different conditions has become increasingly important to understanding the function of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), few computational approaches have been developed for quantitative comparison of CLIP-seq datasets. Here, we present an easy-to-use command line tool, dCLIP, for quantitative CLIP-seq comparative analysis. The two-stage method implemented in dCLIP, including a modified MA normalization method and a hidden Markov model, is shown to be able to effectively identify differential binding regions of RBPs in four CLIP-seq datasets, generated by HITS-CLIP, iCLIP and PAR-CLIP protocols. dCLIP is freely available at http://qbrc.swmed.edu/software/.","authors":["Wang T.","Xie Y.","Xiao G."],"cit_count":27,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"24398258","title":"dCLIP: A computational approach for comparative CLIP-seq analyses","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:dclip","biotoolsID":"dclip","description":"dCLIP is a Perl program for discovering differential binding regions in two comparative CLIP-Seq (HITS-CLIP, PAR-CLIP or iCLIP) experiments.","homepage":"https://qbrc.swmed.edu/softwares.php","name":"DCLIP"}}
