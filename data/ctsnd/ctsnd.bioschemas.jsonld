      "sc:description": "The Clinical Trials Sponsorship Network Dashboard (CTSND) uses force-directed network mapping algorithms to visualize clinical trials sponsorship data. ConflictMetrics is the public-facing portal for data on research funding and conflicts of interest in health and medicine. The site is devoted to providing public access to biomedical research sponsorship and funding data. The focus on data visualization is part of this project's broader aims of helping researchers, policymakers, providers, and patients rethink conflicts of interest. Research projects presented on ConflictMetrics have been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the NSF’s Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), and the National Institutes of Health.",
