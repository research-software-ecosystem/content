Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: The generation of genome-wide maps of histone modifications using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing is a standard approach to dissect the complexity of the epigenome. Interpretation and differential analysis of histone datasets remains challenging due to regulatory meaningful co-occurrences of histone marks and their difference in genomic spread. To ease interpretation, chromatin state segmentation maps are a commonly employed abstraction combining individual histone marks. We developed the tool SCIDDO as a fast, flexible and statistically sound method for the differential analysis of chromatin state segmentation maps. Results: We demonstrate the utility of SCIDDO in a comparative analysis that identifies differential chromatin domains (DCD) in various regulatory contexts and with only moderate computational resources. We show that the identified DCDs correlate well with observed changes in gene expression and can recover a substantial number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We showcase SCIDDO's ability to directly interrogate chromatin dynamics, such as enhancer switches in downstream analysis, which simplifies exploring specific questions about regulatory changes in chromatin. By comparing SCIDDO to competing methods, we provide evidence that SCIDDO's performance in identifying DEGs via differential chromatin marking is more stable across a range of cell-type comparisons and parameter cut-offs.",
