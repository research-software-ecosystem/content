      "sc:description": "It is one of the significant challenges to find unknown subtypes of several diseases at the molecular levels. This task can be addressed by grouping gene expression patterns of the collected samples on the basis of a large number of genes. Application of commonly used clustering methods to such a dataset however are likely to fail, because the number of samples to be grouped is much smaller than the data dimension. To overcome such difficulty, a novel model-based clustering method is developed.",
