Through the use of shapefiles, the application allows visualizing both data and results of a statistical analysis directly on a geographical basis",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Morphometric, biochemical and genetic analyses were conducted on Olea europaea L. of Campania, an area of Southern Italy highly suited to the cultivation of olive trees and the production of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). We aimed to characterize the distribution of morphological, biochemical and genetic diversity in this area and to develop a practical tool to aid traceability of oils. Phenotypes were characterized using morphometric data of drupes and leaves; biochemical and genetic diversity were assessed on the basis of the fatty acid composition of the EVOOs and with microsatellite markers, respectively. We provide an open-source tool as a novel R package titled \u2018OliveR\u2019, useful in performing multivariate data analysis using a point and click interactive approach. These analyses highlight a clear correlation among the morphological, biochemical and genetic profiles of samples with four collection sites, and confirm that Southern Italy represents a wide reservoir of phenotypic and genetic variability.",
