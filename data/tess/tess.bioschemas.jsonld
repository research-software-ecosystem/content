Speciation and extinction rates can be any function of time and mass-extinction events at specific times can be provided. Trees can be simulated either conditioned on the number of species, the time of the process, or both. Additionally, the likelihood equations are implemented for convenience and can be used for Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation and Bayesian inference.",
