      "sc:description": "An Interpretable Prediction Model for Identifying N<sup>7</sup>-Methylguanosine Sites Based on XGBoost and SHAP.\n\nRecent studies have increasingly shown that the chemical modification of mRNA plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. N<sup>7< sup>-methylguanosine (m7G) is a type of positively-charged mRNA modification that plays an essential role for efficient gene expression and cell viability. However, the research on m7G has received little attention to date. Bioinformatics tools can be applied as auxiliary methods to identify m7G sites in transcriptomes. In this study, we develop a novel interpretable machine learning-based approach termed XG-m7G for the differentiation of m7G sites using the XGBoost algorithm and six different types of sequence-encoding schemes. Both 10-fold and jackknife cross-validation tests indicate that XG-m7G outperforms iRNA-m7G",
