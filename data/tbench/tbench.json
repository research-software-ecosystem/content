This paper presents TBench (Termilology Workbench) for multilingual terminology editing and development within a distributed environment. TBench is a web-service Java tool consisting of two main functionalities that are knowledge construction (i.e.extended model based on ISO25964, batch reusing and constructing multilingual concept hierarchy and relationships) and collaborative control in order to achieve custom extensions, reuse, multilingual alignment, integration and refactoring",
