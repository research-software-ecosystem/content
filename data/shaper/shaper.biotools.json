    "description": "The SHAPER model provides user-friendly estimates of SHAPE reactivity from RNA 3D structures. The SHAPER model is an updated version of 3DSSR model, which takes RNA sequence-dependent bias into consideration. By analyzing structural features from an 3D RNA structure, such as 2D base-pairs, solvent accessibility of 2'-OH sites, stacking nucleotides, ribose sugar conformations, etc., the model can combine these key factors to predict the SHAPE reactivity for each nucleotide.",

The local structural information contained in SHAPE reactivity data can be used as constraints in 2D/3D structure predictions. Here, we present SHAPE predictoR (SHAPER), a web server for fast and accurate SHAPE reactivity prediction. The main purpose of the SHAPER web server is to provide a portal that uses experimental SHAPE data to refine 2D/3D RNA structure selection. Input structures for the SHAPER server can be obtained through experimental or computational modeling. The SHAPER server can accept RNA structures with single or multiple conformations, and the predicted SHAPE profile and correlation with experimental SHAPE data (if provided) for each conformation can be freely downloaded through the web portal. The SHAPER web server is available at http://rna.physics.missouri.edu/shaper/.",
