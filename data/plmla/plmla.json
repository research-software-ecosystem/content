Although many computational phosphorylation site prediction tools exist for mammals, and a few were created specifically for Arabidopsis thaliana, none are currently available for other plants.Results: In this article, we propose a novel random forest-based method called PHOSFER (PHOsphorylation Site FindER) for applying phosphorylation data from other organisms to enhance the accuracy of predictions in a target organism. As a test case, PHOSFER is applied to phosphorylation sites in soybean, and we show that it more accurately predicts soybean sites than both the existing Arabidopsis-specific predictors, and a simpler machine-learning scheme that uses only known phosphorylation sites and non-phosphorylation sites from soybean. In addition to soybean, PHOSFER will be extended to other organisms in the near future. \u00a9 The Author 2013.", "citationCount": 32, "authors": [{"name": "Trost B."}, {"name": "Kusalik A."}], "date": "2013-03-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:plmla", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinfo.ncu.edu.cn/inquiries_PLMLA.aspx", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "PLMLA is an in silico online tool for prediction of potential lysine methylation and lysine acetylation from protein sequences.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["MATLAB"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/plmla-prediction-of-lysine-methylation-and-lysine-acetylation.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "plmla", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:10:23Z", "name": "PLMLA", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
