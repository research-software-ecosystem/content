                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The discovery of new lncRNAs (long noncoding RNAs) and their regulatory pathways has always been a hotspot in the field of ceRNA (competing endogenous RNA). Herein, we report opplncRNA (Omics Pilot Platform of lncRNA), a novel and rapid tool for investigating lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions based on the architecture of MATLAB AppDesigner. opplncRNA is useful to analyze the regulatory interaction networks of lncRNA with a friendly GUI (graphical user interface). There are three lncRNA databases (ENCORI, LncBase, and miRcode) about lncRNA-miRNA interactions that have been integrated into opplncRNA, as well as seven miRNA databases (miRcode, ENCORI, TarBase, miRTarBase, miRDB, miRanda, and miRecords) about miRNA-mRNA interactions as also. opplncRNA can read expression data from any profile techniques, such as microarray or RNA-seq. Then, the relationships between lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA can be directly calculated through the profile data of lncRNA, miRNA, and mRNA by the threshold of correlation coefficients. Integrated databases can be used to filter calculation outcomes to obtain more reliable pathways. Moreover, opplncRNA has the functionality of directly demonstrating 3 layers network from lncRNA to mRNA in command line form.",
