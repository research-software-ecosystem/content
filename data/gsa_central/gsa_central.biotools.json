                "abstract": "Copyright © 2022 Huang, Lu, Xie, Jauhari, Xie, Mei and Mora.Gene Set Analysis (GSA) is one of the most commonly used strategies to analyze omics data. Hundreds of GSA-related papers have been published, giving birth to a GSA field in Bioinformatics studies. However, as the field grows, it is becoming more difficult to obtain a clear view of all available methods, resources, and their quality. In this paper, we introduce a web platform called “GSA Central” which, as its name indicates, acts as a focal point to centralize GSA information and tools useful to beginners, average users, and experts in the GSA field. “GSA Central” contains five different resources: A Galaxy instance containing GSA tools (“Galaxy-GSA”), a portal to educational material (“GSA Classroom”), a comprehensive database of articles (“GSARefDB”), a set of benchmarking tools (“GSA BenchmarKING”), and a blog (“GSA Blog”). We expect that “GSA Central” will become a useful resource for users looking for introductory learning, state-of-the-art updates, method/tool selection guidelines and insights, tool usage, tool integration under a Galaxy environment, tool design, and tool validation/benchmarking. Moreover, we expect this kind of platform to become an example of a “thematic platform” containing all the resources that people in the field might need, an approach that could be extended to other bioinformatics topics or scientific fields.",
