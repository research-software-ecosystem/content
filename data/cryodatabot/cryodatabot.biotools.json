    "description": "CryoDataBot is an automated pipeline designed to streamline dataset generation for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM)-based atomic model building. It supports large-scale AI training and benchmarking by providing standardized tools for data retrieval, preprocessing, labeling, and quality control. \n\nCryoDataBot enables flexible configurations for diverse biomolecular structures, improves modeling reproducibility, and facilitates retraining of AI models such as U-Net and CryoREAD. It is open-source and optimized for structural biology applications in RNA and protein modeling.",
