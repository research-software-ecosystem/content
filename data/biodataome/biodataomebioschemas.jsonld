We followed the same preprocessing pipeline for each biological mart to produce ready for downstream analysis and meta-analysis datasets and automatically annotate them with Disease-Ontology terms. We also designate datasets that share common samples. It includes ~2000 datasets, ~200000 samples spanning ~300 diseases. All datasets are publicly available for querying, browsing and downloading via BioDataome web application.",
