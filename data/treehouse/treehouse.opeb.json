Beyond broad patterns, large phylogenies often become uninterpretable as tip labels are so small or excluded altogether. As a result, large phylogenies can be difficult to use for other researchers especially for groups interested in the relationships among a subset of taxa. Here, we introduce treehouse, a user friendly shiny app that allows researchers to obtain subtrees from large-scale phylogenies. Treehouse is populated with a handful of large-scale phylogenies available through treehouseDB. Additionally, treehouse features an additional function, userTree, which allows a user to upload and parse their own phylogeny | Our aim is to make phylogenies more accessible to all and facilitate researchers exploration in their own phylogenies","homepage":"https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/treehouse","name":"treehouse"}}
