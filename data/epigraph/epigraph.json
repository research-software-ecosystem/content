Furthermore, EpiGRAPH learns to predictively identify similar genomic regions. This paper demonstrates EpiGRAPH's practical utility in a case study on monoallelic gene expression and describes its novel approach to reproducible bioinformatic analysis. \u00a9 2009 Bock et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 36, "authors": [{"name": "Bock C."}, {"name": "Halachev K."}, {"name": "Buch J."}, {"name": "Lengauer T."}], "date": "2009-02-10T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Genome Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Dr. Joachim B\u00fcch", "url": "https://bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de/homepage/index.php?&account=buech", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "buech@mpi-inf.mpg.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:epigraph", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://epigraph.mpi-inf.mpg.de/WebGRAPH/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Statistical calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2238"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Enables biologists to analyze genome and epigenome datasets with powerful statistical and machine learning methods.
