All rights reserved.Somatic mutation and gene expression dysregulation are considered two major tumorigenesis factors. While independent investigations of either factor pervade, studies of associations between somatic mutations and gene expression changes have been sporadic and nonsystematic. Utilizing genomic data collected from 11 315 subjects of 33 distinct cancer types, we constructed MutEx, a pan-cancer integrative genomic database. This database records the relationships among gene expression, somatic mutation and survival data for cancer patients. MutEx can be used to swiftly explore the relationship between these genomic/clinic features within and across cancer types and, more importantly, search for corroborating evidence for hypothesis inception. Our database also incorporated Gene Ontology and several pathway databases to enhance functional annotation, and elastic net and a gene expression composite score to aid in survival analysis. To demonstrate the usability of MutEx, we provide several application examples, including top somatic mutations associated with the most extensive expression dysregulation in breast cancer, differential mutational burden downstream of DNA mismatch repair gene mutations and composite gene expression score-based survival difference in breast cancer.
