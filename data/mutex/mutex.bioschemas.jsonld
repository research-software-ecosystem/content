      "sc:description": "A multifaceted gateway for exploring integrative pan-cancer genomic data.\n\nSomatic mutation and gene expression dysregulation are considered two major tumorigenesis factors. While independent investigations of either factor pervade, studies of associations between somatic mutations and gene expression changes have been sporadic and nonsystematic. Utilizing genomic data collected from 11 315 subjects of 33 distinct cancer types, we constructed MutEx, a pan-cancer integrative genomic database. This database records the relationships among gene expression, somatic mutation and survival data for cancer patients. MutEx can be used to swiftly explore the relationship between these genomic clinic features within and across cancer types and, more importantly, search for corroborating evidence for hypothesis inception.",
