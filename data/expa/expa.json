ExPa analysis has been used for a number of studies to determine properties of metabolic networks as well as to obtain insight into their physiological and functional states in silico. However, the number of ExPas, p = {pi} , grows with the size and complexity of the network being studied, and this poses a computational challenge. For this study, we investigated the relationship between the number of extreme pathways and simple network properties. Results: We established an estimating function for the number of ExPas using these easily obtainable network measurements. In particular, it was found that log [p] had an exponential relationship with log [\u2211i=1Rd1d+1 c1], where R = Reff is the number of active reactions in a network, d-i and d+i the incoming and outgoing degrees of the reactions ri \u2208 Reff, and ci the clustering coefficient for each active reaction. Conclusion: This relationship typically gave an estimate of the number of extreme pathways to within a factor of 10 of the true number. Such a function providing an estimate for the total number of ExPas for a given system will enable researchers to decide whether ExPas analysis is an appropriate investigative tool. \u00a9 2007 Yeung et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 39, "authors": [{"name": "Yeung M."}, {"name": "Thiele I."}, {"name": "Palsson B.Oo."}], "date": "2007-09-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://gcrg.ucsd.edu/Researchers/Palsson", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:expa", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["50216"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://gcrg.ucsd.edu/Downloads/ExtremePathwayAnalysis", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pathway analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2497"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "ExPa (extreme pathways analysis) , a generating set for all possible steady state flux maps in a biochemical reaction network, can be computed from the stoichiometric matrix, an incidence-like matrix reflecting the network topology.
