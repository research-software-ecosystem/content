Reproduction in Domestic Animals published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH.The concepts of Evidence-based Veterinary Medicine (EBVM) provide a methodological and systematic approach to include the best evidence from research into clinical decision-making. These concepts include steps as the search and assessment of relevant research findings and consideration of individual aspects. In addition, owners and other persons involved in animal health care should be included in shared decision-making. Some breeders have good basic knowledge concerning breeding management and characteristics of diseases and concerning advantages and disadvantages of different therapeutic approaches, while others are notable to understand complex medical interrelations or emergency situations. All these aspects need to be addressed when communicating and discussing different diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic options. In special fields, such as small animal reproduction, veterinarians often see animals with rare diseases or complex conditions so that an application of standard therapies and well-established textbook recommendations is not possible. To learn more about cases too rare for successful systematic research, the case collection tool REPROCASES (www.evssar.org/reprocases) is now available. The aim of this project is to gather information from specialists on small animal reproduction in a multicentre approach. If you see rare or not well-investigated cases such as cystic ovarian diseases, cryptorchidism or others, you are more than welcome to share your findings via the database. Even if this approach cannot completely replace standardized clinical trials, the idea is to gather more information on effects, prognosis, side effects and long-term fertility for specific conditions.",
