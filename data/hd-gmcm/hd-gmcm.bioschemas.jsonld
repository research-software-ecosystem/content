Accurate subtyping is crucial for tailoring therapeutic strategies that can potentially lead to reduced mortality and morbidity. Model-based clustering, such as Gaussian mixture models, provides a principled and interpretable methodology that is widely used to identify subtypes. However, they impose identical marginal distributions on each variable; such assumptions restrict their modeling flexibility and deteriorates clustering performance. RESULTS:In this paper, we use the statistical framework of copulas to decouple the modeling of marginals from the dependencies between them. Current copula-based methods cannot scale to high dimensions due to challenges in parameter inference",
