  "sc:description": "Apowerful discriminative modeling approach that is faster (~30×) and more accurate than existing methods. It is capable of learning from the admixed samples themselves to boost performance and autocorrect phasing errors. RFMix shows high sensitivity and specificity in simulated Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans and admixed Europeans, Africans, and Asians.",
