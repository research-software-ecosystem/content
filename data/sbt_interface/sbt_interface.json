    "description": "Tool accompanying the NCBI&apos,s Major Histocompatibility Complex database (dbMHC). It identifies the allelic composition of sequence-based typing (SBT) results of cDNA or genomic sequences. Samples are compared with databases containing all known alleles for several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) loci. An interactive sequence viewer allows inspection of the alignments.",

Whether the samples are heterozygous, haploid or a combination of the two, they can be compared with two up-to-date databases of all known alleles of several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) loci. The results of the submission are returned as a table of potential allele hits, along with the respective base changes and an interactive sequence viewer for close examination of the alignment. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
