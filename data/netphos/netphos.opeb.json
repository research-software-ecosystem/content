How is specificity in substrate recognition and phosphorylation by protein kinases achieved? Here, we present an artificial neural network method that predicts phosphorylation sites in independent sequences with a sensitivity in the range from 69% to 96%. As an example, we predict novel phosphorylation sites in the p300/CBP protein that may regulate interaction with transcription factors and histone acetyltransferase activity. In addition, serine and threonine residues in p300/CBP that can be modified by O-linked glycosylation with N-acetylglucosamine are identified. Glycosylation may prevent phosphorplation at these sites, a mechanism named yin-yang regulation.
