      "sc:description": "An Online Prognostic Biomarker Analysis Tool for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.\n\nLiver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world with an increasing number of fatalities. Identification of novel prognosis biomarker for LIHC may improve treatment and therefore patient outcomes. The availability of public gene expression profiling data offers the opportunity to discover prognosis biomarkers for LIHC. We developed an online consensus survival analysis tool named OSlihc using gene expression profiling and long-term follow-up data to identify new prognosis biomarkers. OSlihc consists of 637 cases from four independent cohorts. As a risk assessment tool, OSlihc generates the Kaplan-Meier survival plot with hazard ratio (HR) and p value to evaluate the prognostic value of a gene of interest",
