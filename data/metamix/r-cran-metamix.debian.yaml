  description: GNU R bayesian mixture analysis for metagenomic community profiling
  long_description: " Resolves complex metagenomic mixtures by analysing deep sequencing\n\
    \ data, using a mixture model based approach. The use of parallel Monte\n Carlo\
    \ Markov chains for the exploration of the species space enables\n the identification\
    \ of the set of species more likely to contribute to\n the mixture.\n"
