description: 'BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
  a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms:
  BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina
  sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from
  70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support
  and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
  for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better
  performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.'
