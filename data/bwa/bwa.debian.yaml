description: >
   BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against
   a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of
   three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first
   algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while
   the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM
   and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split
   alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended
   for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM
   also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina
   reads.
