      "sc:description": "Sample matching using SNPs in humans.\n\nA tool for sample swap identification in high throughput sequencing studies.\n\nSample swaps are a real concern in high throughput sequencing studies. SMaSH helps detect such sample swaps by integrating the information from over 6000 carefully selected single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites from across the human genome to identify which samples in a group of sequencing data sets are derived from the same human individual. Importantly, SMaSH is able to verify sample identity between different data types, such as RNA-Seq, exome, and MethylCap-Seq data.",
