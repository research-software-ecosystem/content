However, there are still no clear conclusions as to what kind of message is more effective for motivating smokers to quit. This study compared the effectiveness of loss- and gain-framed messages in the online recruitment of smokers via Facebook Advertising. Loss- and gain-framed messages about smoking were created and released as Facebook ads. Users who clicked on the ads were automatically redirected to the \u201cLive Without Tobacco\u201d intervention (http://www.vivasemtabaco.com.br). The amount spent on the ads was BRL 647.64. Data were collected from the Facebook Ads platform and from a relational database. Analyses were performed on the 6,350 users who clicked on one of the ads and 1,731 who were successfully redirected to the intervention. Gain-framed ads reached 174,029 people and loss-framed ads reached 180,527. The former received 2,688 clicks, while the latter received 3,662. The cost of the click was BRL 0.12 per gain-framed ad and BRL 0.09 per loss-framed ad. Loss-framed ads reached more users, got more clicks (and website accesses), and led to more accounts and quit plans being created. Loss-framed messages about smoking appear to be more cost-effective for both initial recruitment and intervention engagement. Facebook has proven to be a good outreach and recruitment tool and can be a solution for the difficulty in reaching smokers for cessation interventions.",
