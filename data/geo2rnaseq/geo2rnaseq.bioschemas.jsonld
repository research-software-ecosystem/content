It can be used for finding significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in well sequenced organisms. This package is a complete function library for analyzing read files, trimming of raw reads, mapping on reference genomes, counting reads per gene and finding significant DEGs | PRIVACY POLICY : EULA (Anaconda Cloud v2.33.29) © 2019 Anaconda, Inc.
