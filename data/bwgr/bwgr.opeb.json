The bWGR offers a compendium of Bayesian methods with various priors available, allowing users to predict complex traits with different genetic architectures. RESULTS:Here we introduce bWGR, an R package that enables users to efficient fit and cross-validate Bayesian and likelihood whole-genome regression methods. It implements a series of methods referred to as the Bayesian alphabet under the traditional Gibbs sampling and optimized Expectation-Maximization. The package also enables fitting efficient multivariate models and complex hierarchical models. The package is user-friendly and computational efficient. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION:bWGR is an R package available in the CRAN repository. It can be installed in R by typing: install.packages(\"bWGR\").\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31647543","name":"bWGR"}}
