  description: 'R package: DNA copy number data analysis'
  long_description: " Implements the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm\
    \ to segment DNA\n copy number data and identify genomic regions with abnormal\
    \ copy number.\n .\n This package is for analyzing array DNA copy number data,\
    \ which is usually\n (but not always) called array Comparative Genomic Hybridization\
    \ (array CGH)\n data It implements a methodology for finding change-points in\
    \ these data which\n are points after which the (log) test over reference ratios\
    \ have changed\n location. This model is that the change-points correspond to\
    \ positions where\n the underlying DNA copy number has changed. Therefore, change-points\
    \ can be\n used to identify regions of gained and lost copy number. Also provided\
    \ is a\n function for making relevant plots of these data.\n"
