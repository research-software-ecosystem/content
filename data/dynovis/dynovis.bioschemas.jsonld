      "sc:description": "A web tool to study dynamic perturbations for capturing dose-over-time effects in biological networks | BACKGROUND:The development of high throughput sequencing techniques provides us with the possibilities to obtain large data sets, which capture the effect of dynamic perturbations on cellular processes. However, because of the dynamic nature of these processes, the analysis of the results is challenging. Therefore, there is a great need for bioinformatics tools that address this problem. RESULTS:Here we present DynOVis, a network visualization tool that can capture dynamic dose-over-time effects in biological networks. DynOVis is an integrated work frame of R packages and JavaScript libraries and offers a force-directed graph network style, involving multiple network analysis methods such as degree threshold, but more importantly, it allows for node expression animations as well as a frame-by-frame view of the dynamic exposure",
