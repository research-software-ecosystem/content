description: The function missForest in this package is used to impute missing values
  particularly in the case of mixed-type data. It uses a random forest trained on
  the observed values of a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used
  to impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex interactions and
  non-linear relations. It yields an out-of-bag (OOB) imputation error estimate without
  the need of a test set or elaborate cross-validation. It can be run in parallel
  to save computation time.
