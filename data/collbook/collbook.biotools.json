    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'collNotes', 'Results:collNotes', 'Conclusions:collNotes' | A born-digital field-to-database solution for collections-based research using collNotes and collBook | collBook: Refine biological field observations | Modernizing Field Collection Techniques | collBook, is the desktop counterpart for the mobile app collNotes. Combined they are a field-to-database solution designed for field biologists to gather and format \u201cborn digital\u201d field notes into database ready formats. A mobile application, collNote is being developed for Android and iOS devices to gather Darwin Core formatted field notes. A desktop application, collBook is being developed for Linux, OS X, and Windows to refine those field notes into portal ready Darwin Core files and specimen labels. Field note refinements include: reverse geocoding localities, taxonomic alignments, and creation of customizable labels which can optionally include catalog number barcodes",
