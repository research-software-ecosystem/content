Bgee first maps heterogeneous expression data (currently EST, Affymetrix, and in situ hybridization data) on anatomical and developmental ontologies.  Then, in order to perform automated cross species comparisons, homology relationships across anatomical ontologies, and comparison criteria between developmental ontologies, are designed.",
