It includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and evaluating the number of ancestral populations; identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with an environmental gradient or with variables used as proxies for ecological pressures, and controlling the false discovery rate.",
