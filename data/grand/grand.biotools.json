    "description": "A Python Module for Grand Canonical Water Sampling in OpenMM.\n\ngrand : Grand Canonical Water Sampling in OpenMM.\n\nThis Python module is designed to be run with OpenMM in order to simulate grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) insertion and deletion moves of water molecules. This allows the particle number to vary according to a fixed chemical potential, and offers enhanced sampling of water molecules in occluded binding sites. The theory behind our work on GCMC sampling can be found in the References section below.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 American Chemical Society.Networks of water molecules can play a critical role at the protein-ligand interface and can directly influence drug-target interactions. Grand canonical methods aid in the sampling of these water molecules, where conventional molecular dynamics equilibration times are often long, by allowing waters to be inserted and deleted from the system, according to the chemical potential. Here, we present our open source Python module, grand (https://github.com/essex-lab/grand), which allows molecular dynamics simulations to be performed in conjunction with grand canonical Monte Carlo sampling, using the OpenMM simulation engine. We demonstrate the accuracy of this module by reproducing the density of bulk water observed from constant pressure simulations. Application of this code to the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein reproduces three buried crystallographic water sites that are poorly sampled using conventional molecular dynamics.",
