The high coverage achievable with these methods enables the detection of many low-frequency variants. However, sequencing errors complicate the analysis of mixed populations and result in inflated estimates of genetic diversity. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian approach to minimize the effect of errors on the detection of minority variants. We applied it to pyrosequencing data obtained from a 1.5kb-fragment of the HIV-1 gag/pol gene in two control and two clinical samples. The effect of PCR amplification was analysed. Error correction resulted in a two- and five-fold decrease of the pyrosequencing base substitution rate, from 0.05 to 0.03 and from 0.25 to 0.05 in the non-PCR and PCR-amplified samples, respectively. We were able to detect viral clones as rare as 0.1 with perfect sequence reconstruction. Probabilistic haplotype inference outperforms the counting-based calling method in both precision and recall. Genetic diversity observed within and between two clinical samples resulted in various patterns of phenotypic drug resistance and suggests a close epidemiological link. We conclude that pyrosequencing can be used to investigate genetically diverse samples with high accuracy if technical errors are properly treated. \u00a9 2010 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 143, "authors": [{"name": "Zagordi O."}, {"name": "Klein R."}, {"name": "Daumer M."}, {"name": "Beerenwinkel N."}], "date": "2010-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": [], "name": "SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Osvaldo Zagordi", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "osvaldo.zagordi@bsse.ethz.ch"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:shorah", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/ozagordi/shorah", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Haplotype mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0487"}, {"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Inference of a population from a set of short reads.
