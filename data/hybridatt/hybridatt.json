    "description": "A hybrid self-attention deep learning framework for multivariate sleep stage classification.\n\nBACKGROUND:Sleep is a complex and dynamic biological process characterized by different sleep patterns. Comprehensive sleep monitoring and analysis using multivariate polysomnography (PSG) records has achieved significant efforts to prevent sleep-related disorders. To alleviate the time consumption caused by manual visual inspection of PSG, automatic multivariate sleep stage classification has become an important research topic in medical and bioinformatics. RESULTS:We present a unified hybrid self-attention deep learning framework, namely HybridAtt, to automatically classify sleep stages by capturing channel and temporal correlations from multivariate PSG records. We construct a new multi-view convolutional representation module to learn channel-specific and global view features from the heterogeneous PSG inputs.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
