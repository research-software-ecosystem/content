This tool provides the following features: (i) the construction of genotype networks for categorical and univariate phenotypes; (ii) analyses of genotype network topology and how it relates to robustness and evolvability, as well as analyses of genotype network topography and how it relates to the navigability of a genotype network; (iii) multiple interactive visualizations.",
