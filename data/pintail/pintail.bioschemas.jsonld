  "sc:description": "Program for detecting and analysing 16S rRNA chimeras and other anomalies. Pintail is a tool for identifying anomalies, including chimeras, within 16S rDNA sequences. The program works by comparing evolutionary distances between a query and subject sequence over the length of the 16S rRNA gene (small subunit rRNA), by employing a sampling window of specified size, progressing a fixed number of bases at a time along the length of the gene.",
