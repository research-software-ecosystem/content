  "http://schema.org/description": "The ultimate goal of the NET framework is to make images of networks processable by computers. Therefore we want to have a pixel based image as input, as output we want a representation of the network visible in the image that retains as much information about the original network as possible. NET achives this by first segmenting the image and then vectorizing the network and then extracting information. The information we extract is\n\nFirst and foremost the graph of the network. We find the crossings (nodes) and connections between crossings (edges) and therefore extract information about the neighborhood relations, the topology of the network.\nWe also extract the coordinates of all nodes which enables us to embed them into space. We therefore extract information about the geometry of the network.\nLast but not least we track the radii of the edges in the extraction process. Therefore every edge has a radius which can be identified with its conductivity.\n\nIn the following we will first provide detailed instructions on how to install NET on several platforms. Then we describe the functionality and options of each of the four scripts that make up the NET framework.\n",
