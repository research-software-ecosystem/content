  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>The ultimate goal of the <em>NET</em> framework is to make images of networks processable by computers. Therefore we want to have a pixel based image as input, as output we want a representation of the network visible in the image that retains as much information about the original network as possible. <em>NET</em> achives this by first segmenting the image and then vectorizing the network and then extracting information. The information we extract is</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>First and foremost the graph of the network. We find the crossings (nodes) and connections between crossings (edges) and therefore extract information about the neighborhood relations, the <em>topology</em> of the network.</li>\r\n\t<li>We also extract the coordinates of all nodes which enables us to embed them into space. We therefore extract information about the <em>geometry</em> of the network.</li>\r\n\t<li>Last but not least we track the radii of the edges in the extraction process. Therefore every edge has a radius which can be identified with its conductivity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In the following we will first provide detailed instructions on how to install <em>NET</em> on several platforms. Then we describe the functionality and options of each of the four scripts that make up the <em>NET</em> framework.</p>\r\n",
