All models and assignments are available to browse and download at http://supfam.org. A new hidden Markov model library based on SCOP 1.75 has been created and a previously ignored class of SCOP, coiled coils, is now included. Our scoring component now uses HMMER3, which is in orders of magnitude faster and produces superior results. A cloud-based pipeline was implemented and is publicly available at Amazon web services elastic computer cloud. The SUPERFAMILY reference tree of life has been improved allowing the user to highlight a chosen superfamily, family or domain architecture on the tree of life. The most significant advance in SUPERFAMILY is that now it contains a domain-based gene ontology (GO) at the superfamily and family levels. A new methodology was developed to ensure a high quality GO annotation. The new methodology is general purpose and has been used to produce domainbased phenotypic ontologies in addition to GO. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "citationCount": 91, "authors": [{"name": "De Lima Morais D.A."}, {"name": "Fang H."}, {"name": "Rackham O.J.L."}, {"name": "Wilson D."}, {"name": "Pethica R."}, {"name": "Chothia C."}, {"name": "Gough J."}], "date": "2011-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Contact Form", "url": "http://supfam.org/SUPERFAMILY/feedback.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:superfamily", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://supfam.org", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein super-secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0268"}, {"term": "Protein fold recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}, {"term": "Protein structure assignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0320"}, {"term": "Structure classification", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2996"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "It provides protein domain assignments at the structural classification of protein superfamily level for completely sequenced genomes, metagenomes and other gene collections such as UniProt.
