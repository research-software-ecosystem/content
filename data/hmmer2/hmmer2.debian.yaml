description: HMMER is an implementation of profile hidden Markov model methods for
  sensitive searches of biological sequence databases using multiple sequence alignments
  as queries. . Given a multiple sequence alignment as input, HMMER builds a statistical
  model called a "hidden Markov model" which can then be used as a query into a sequence
  database to find (and/or align) additional homologues of the sequence family.
