From those we have selected five (HPIDB, MINT, DIP, BioGRID and IntAct) as we think are the most comprehensive. Moreover, four other resources outside IMEX were included, VirHostNet, STRING, VIH-1 NCBI and PHISTO. VirHostNet is one of the most complete resources for Vir-Host interactions. STRING is the largest repository of protein-protein interaction, in the service only the experimental interaction of STRING were included. Dataset used in the benchmark of the PredHPI manuscript were finally included.",
