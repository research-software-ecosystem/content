Like a treasure-hunt, the EXTraS project is harvesting the hitherto unexplored temporal domain information buried in the serendipitous data collected by the European Photon Imaging Camera (EPIC) instrument onboard the ESA XMM-Newton, in 16 years of observations. Part of this analysis is performed through a dedicated science gateway, the EXTraS portal, whose initial release is the subject of this paper.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ceur-ws', 'observatories', 'treasure-hunt', 'XMM-Newton'","homepage":"http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1871/paper8.pdf","name":"paper8.pdf"}}
