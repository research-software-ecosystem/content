The Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) network uses a standardized process to define, assign, and code causes of stillbirth and child death (<5 years of age) across the CHAMPS network. A Determination of Cause of Death (DeCoDe) panel composed of experts from a local CHAMPS site analyzes all available individual information, including laboratory, histopathology, abstracted clinical records, and verbal autopsy findings for each case and, if applicable, also for the mother.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DeCoDe'","homepage":"https://champshealth.org/protocols/","name":"CHAMPS"}}
