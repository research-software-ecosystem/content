      "sc:description": "Estimation of cell-level SNVs from scRNA-seq data.\n\nSCReadCounts is a computational tool for a cell-level assessment of the read counts bearing a particular nucleotide at genomic positions of interest from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data.\n\nSCReadCounts is available as a self-contained binary package for 64-bit Linux systems, as Python source, and MacOS (Darwin). The self-contained binary package is appropriate for most Linux and MacOS users. The pythonic version requires pysam, numpy and scipy along with other packages (See the install instructions for more details).",
