Standardized graphical notation is crucial for efficient and accurate communication of biological knowledge between researchers with various backgrounds in the expanding field of systems biology. Here, we highlight SBGN from a practical point of view and describe how the user can build and simulate SBGN models from a simple drag-and-drop graphical user interface in PathwayLab. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","authors":["Jansson A.","Jirstrand M."],"cit_count":9,"journal":"Drug Discovery Today","pmid":"20211756","title":"Biochemical modeling with Systems Biology Graphical Notation","year":"2010-05-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pathwaylab","biotoolsID":"pathwaylab","description":"In silico pathway analysis tool, enabling pharmaceutical R&D to reach their target decisions faster and with higher accuracy.","homepage":"http://www.garuda-alliance.org/","name":"PathwayLab"}}
