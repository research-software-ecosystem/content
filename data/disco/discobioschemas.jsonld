  "sc:description": "DISCO is software to perform structure determination of protein homo-oligomers with cyclic symmetry.DISCO computes oligomeric protein structures using geometric constraints derived from RDCs and intermolecular distance restraints such as NOEs or disulfide bonds. When a reliable subunit structure can be calculated from intramolecular restraints, DISCO guarantees that all satisfying oligomer structures will be discovered, yet can run in minutes to hours on only a single desktop-class computer.",
