The key goal of IPAVS is to provide biologists access to expert-curated pathways from experimental data belonging to specific biological contexts related to cell types, tissues, organs and diseases. IPAVS currently integrates over 500 human pathways (consisting of 24 574 interactions) that include metabolic-, signaling- and diseaserelated pathways, drug-action pathways and several large process maps collated from other pathway resources. IPAVS web interface allows biologists to browse and search pathway resources and provides tools for data import, management, visualization and analysis to support the interpretation of biological data in light of cellular processes. Systems Biology Graphical Notations (SBGN) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway notations are used for the visual display of pathway information. The integrated datasets in IPAVS are made available in several standard data formats that can be downloaded. IPAVS is available at: http://ipavs.cidms.org. © The Author(s) 2011.","authors":["Sreenivasaiah P.K.","Rani S.","Cayetano J.","Arul N.","Kim D.H."],"cit_count":16,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22140115","title":"IPAVS: Integrated pathway resources, analysis and visualization system","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ipavs","biotoolsID":"ipavs","description":"integrated Pathway Resources, Analysis and Visualization System: provides a collection of highly-structured manually curated human pathway data, it also integrates biological pathway information from several public databases and provides several tools to manipulate,filter, browse, search, analyze, visualize and compare the integrated pathway resources.","homepage":"http://ipavs.cidms.org/","name":"iPAVS"}}
