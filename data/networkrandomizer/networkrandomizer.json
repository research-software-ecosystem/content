With the increasing amount of information, network-based models are gaining more and more interest and new techniques are required in order to mine the information and to validate the results. To fill the validation gap we present an app, for the Cytoscape platform, which aims at creating randomised networks and randomising existing, real networks. Since there is a lack of tools that allow performing such operations, our app aims at enabling researchers to exploit different, well known random network models that could be used as a benchmark for validating real, biological datasets. We also propose a novel methodology for creating random weighted networks, i.e. the multiplication algorithm, starting from real, quantitative data. Finally, the app provides a statistical tool that compares real versus randomly computed attributes, in order to validate the numerical findings. In summary, our app aims at creating a standardised methodology for the validation of the results in the context of the Cytoscape platform.", "citationCount": 5, "authors": [{"name": "Tosadori G."}, {"name": "Bestvina I."}, {"name": "Spoto F."}, {"name": "Laudanna C."}, {"name": "Scardoni G."}], "date": "2017-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "F1000Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://github.com/gabrielet/Network-Randomizer/issues", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!newtopic/cytoscape-helpdesk", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:networkrandomizer", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.1.3"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/networkrandomizer", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Network simulation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3562"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Create randomised networks and randomize existing, real networks.It can process the statistical information gained from the these networks in order to pinpoint their special, non-random characteristics.", "toolType": ["Plug-in"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "https://github.com/gabrielet/Network-Randomizer", "note": null, "type": "Repository"}], "biotoolsID": "networkrandomizer", "additionDate": "2018-08-13T21:42:12Z", "name": "NetworkRandomizer", "license": "Apache-2.0", "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
