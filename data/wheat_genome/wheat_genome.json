However, improvement of this crop has been limited due to its large and complex genome. Advances in genomics are supporting wheat crop improvement. We provide a variety of web-based systems hosting wheat genome and genomic data to support wheat research and crop improvement. WheatGenome.info is an integrated database resource which includes multiple web-based applications. These include a GBrowse2-based wheat genome viewer with BLAST search portal, TAGdb for searching wheat second-generation genome sequence data, wheat autoSNPdb, links to wheat genetic maps using CMap and CMap3D, and a wheat genome Wiki to allow interaction between diverse wheat genome sequencing activities. This system includes links to a variety of wheat genome resources hosted at other research organizations. This integrated database aims to accelerate wheat genome research and is freely accessible via the web interface at http://www.wheatgenome.info/. \u00a9 2011 The Author.", "citationCount": 33, "authors": [{"name": "Lai K."}, {"name": "Berkman P.J."}, {"name": "Lorenc M.T."}, {"name": "Duran C."}, {"name": "Smits L."}, {"name": "Manoli S."}, {"name": "Stiller J."}, {"name": "Edwards D."}], "date": "2012-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Plant and Cell Physiology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "unimelb.edu.au", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Australia", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Dave.Edwards@uq.edu.au"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:wheat_genome", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.wheatgenome.info/wheat_genome_databases.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Individual chromosome arms are being assembled and annotated.
