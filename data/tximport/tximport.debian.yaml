description: "Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and transcript\
  \ lengths, and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream gene-level analysis\
  \ packages. Average transcript length, weighted by sample-specific transcript abundance\
  \ estimates, is provided as a matrix which can be used as an offset for different\
  \ expression of gene-level counts.\n"
