The method has played an instrumental role in the analysis of eukaryotic promoter elements. The signal search analysis server provides access to four different computer programs as well as to a large number of precompiled functional site collections. The programs offered allow: (i) the identification of non-random sequence regions under evolutionary constraint; (ii) the detection of consensus sequence-based motifs that are over- or under-represented at a particular distance from a functional site; (iii) the analysis of the positional distribution of a consensus sequence- or weight matrix-based sequence motif around a functional site; and (iv) the optimization of a weight matrix description of a locally over-represented sequence motif. These programs can be accessed at: http://www.isrec.isb-sib.ch/ssa/.","authors":["Ambrosini G.","Praz V.","Jagannathan V.","Bucher P."],"cit_count":11,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"12824379","title":"Signal search analysis server","year":"2003-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ssa","biotoolsID":"ssa","description":"SSA (Signal Search Analysis) is a software package for the analysis of nucleic acid sequence motifs that are postionally correlated with a functional site (e.g a transcription or translation initiation site).","homepage":"http://ccg.vital-it.ch/ssa/","name":"SSA"}}
