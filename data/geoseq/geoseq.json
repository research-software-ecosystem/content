Despite being rich data sources, they have not been used much due to the difficulty in locating and analyzing datasets of interest.Results: Geoseq http://geoseq.mssm.edu provides a new method of analyzing short reads from deep sequencing experiments. Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data. It is web-based, and holds pre-computed data from public libraries. The analysis reduces the input sequence to tiles and measures the coverage of each tile in a sequence library through the use of suffix arrays. The user can upload custom target sequences or use gene/miRNA names for the search and get back results as plots and spreadsheet files. Geoseq organizes the public sequencing data using a controlled vocabulary, allowing identification of relevant libraries by organism, tissue and type of experiment.Conclusions: Analysis of small sets of sequences against deep-sequencing datasets, as well as identification of public datasets of interest, is simplified by Geoseq. We applied Geoseq to, a) identify differential isoform expression in mRNA-seq datasets, b) identify miRNAs (microRNAs) in libraries, and identify mature and star sequences in miRNAS and c) to identify potentially mis-annotated miRNAs. The ease of using Geoseq for these analyses suggests its utility and uniqueness as an analysis tool. \u00a9 2010 Gurtowski et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Gurtowski J."}, {"name": "Cancio A."}, {"name": "Shah H."}, {"name": "Levovitz C."}, {"name": "George A."}, {"name": "Homann R."}, {"name": "Sachidanandam R."}], "date": "2010-10-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Anthony Cancio", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "anthony.cancio@mssm.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:geoseq", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://katahdin.mssm.edu/web_tools/geoseq/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Read mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3198"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Instead of mapping the reads to reference genomes or sequences, Geoseq maps a reference sequence against the sequencing data.
