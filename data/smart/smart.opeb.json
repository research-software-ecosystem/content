SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool) is a web resource (http://smart.embl.de/) providing simple identification and extensive annotation of protein domains and the exploration of protein domain architectures. In the current version, SMART contains manually curated models for more than 1200 protein domains, with ∼200 new models since our last update article. The underlying protein databases were synchronized with UniProt, Ensembl and STRING, bringing the total number of annotated domains and other protein features above 100 million. SMART's 'Genomic' mode, which annotates proteins from completely sequenced genomes was greatly expanded and now includes 2031 species, compared to 1133 in the previous release. SMART analysis results pages have been completely redesigned and include links to several new information sources. A new, vector-based display engine has been developed for protein schematics in SMART, which can also be exported as highresolution bitmap images for easy inclusion into other documents. Taxonomic tree displays in SMART have been significantly improved, and can be easily navigated using the integrated search engine.","authors":["Letunic I.","Doerks T.","Bork P."],"cit_count":672,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gku949","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"SMART: Recent updates, new developments and status in 2015","type":"Primary","year":"2015-01-28"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:smart","biotoolsID":"smart","description":"SMART protein domain database.","homepage":"http://smart.embl.de/","name":"Simple modular architecture research tool (SMART)"}}
