      "sc:description": "A web-based module of ANDSystem for the search of knowledge in the scientific literature.\nThe rapid growth of scientific literature has rendered the task of finding relevant information one of the critical problems in almost any research. Search engines, like Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Scopus, and others, are highly effective in document search; however, they do not allow knowledge extraction. In contrast to the search engines, text-mining systems provide extraction of knowledge with representations in the form of semantic networks. Of particular interest are tools performing a full cycle of knowledge management and engineering, including automated retrieval, integration, and representation of knowledge in the form of semantic networks, their visualization, and analysis. STRING, Pathway Studio, MetaCore, and others are well-known examples of such products",
