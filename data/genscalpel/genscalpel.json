This routine task in bioinformatics analysis is a pressing need for laboratory biologists. Another objective of application development is to respond to the new form of the NCBI Nucleotide Sequence Database, which was updated in November 2011. In addition to a powerful sequence refinement application, GenScalpel provides convenient functions for web-based sequence downloading or multiple files batch processing. This note discusses major applications of the program and includes example data sets to demonstrate its performance. The program is written in PERL. GenScalpel, including installation packages for Windows and Linux systems as well as the accompanying documentation, are available free of charge at http://genscalpel.biosv.com/. \u00a9 2012 The American Genetic Association.",
