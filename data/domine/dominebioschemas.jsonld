  "sc:description": "Collection of known and predicted domain-domain interactions (DDIs) compiled from 15 different sources. The updated version includes 2285 new domain-domain interactions (DDIs) inferred from experimentally characterized high-resolution three-dimensional structures, and about 3500 novel predictions by five computational approaches published over the last 3 years. New features include a new classification scheme to assign confidence levels to predicted DDIs.",
