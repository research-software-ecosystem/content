We present VariantStore, a system for efficiently indexing and searching millions of genomic variants across thousands of samples. We show the scalability of VariantStore by indexing genomic variants from the TCGA-BRCA project containing 8640 samples and 5M variants in ≈ 4 Hrs and the 1000 genomes project containing 2500 samples and 924M variants in ≈ 3 Hrs. Querying for variants in a gene takes between 2 milliseconds to 3 seconds using memory only ≈ 10% of the size of the full representation. As a baseline, VariantStore outperformed VG toolkit by 3× in terms of memory-usage and construction time and uses 25% less disk space although VG toolkit does not support variant queries.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!","homepage":"https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/variantstore488","name":"VariantStore"}}
