The development for motif finders has flourished in the past years with many tools have been introduced to the research community. Although these tools possess exceptional features for detecting motifs, they report different results for an identical data set. Hence, using multiple tools is recommended because motifs reported by several tools are likely biologically significant. However, the results from multiple tools need to be compared for obtaining common significant motifs. MOTIFSIM web tool and command-line tool were developed for this purpose. In this work, we present several technical improvements as well as additional features to further support the motif analysis in our new release MOTIFSIM 2.1.",
