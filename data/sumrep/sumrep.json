    "description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | a summary statistic framework for immune receptor repertoire comparison and model validation | Abstract The adaptive immune system generates an incredible diversity of antigen receptors for B and T cells to keep dangerous pathogens at bay. The DNA sequences coding for these receptors arise by a complex recombination process followed by a series of productivity-based filters, as well as affinity maturation for B cells, giving considerable diversity to the circulating pool of receptor sequences. Although these datasets hold considerable promise for medical and public health applications, the complex structure of the resulting adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) datasets makes analysis difficult. In this paper we introduce sumrep , an R package that efficiently performs a wide variety of repertoire summaries and comparisons, and show how sumrep can be used to perform model validation",
