  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>There are many methods in bio-imaging that can be parametrized. This gives more flexibility<br />\r\nto the user as long as tools provide easy support for tuning parameters. On the other hand, the<br />\r\ndatasets of interest constantly grow which creates the need to process them in bulk. Again,<br />\r\nthis requires proper tool support, if biologist is going to be able to organize such bulk<br />\r\nprocessing in an ad-hoc manner without the help of a programmer. Finally, new image<br />\r\nanalysis algorithms are being constantly created and updated. Yet, lots of work is necessary to<br />\r\nextend a prototype implementation into product for the users. Therefore, there is a growing<br />\r\nneed for software with a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes the process of image<br />\r\nanalysis easier to perform and at the same time allows for high throughput analysis of raw<br />\r\ndata using batch processing and novel algorithms. Main program in this area are written in<br />\r\nJava, but Python grow in bioinformatics and will be nice to allow easy wrap algorithm written<br />\r\nin this language.<br />\r\nHere we present PartSeg, a comprehensive software package implementing several image<br />\r\nprocessing algorithms that can be used for analysis of microscopic 3D images. Its user<br />\r\ninterface has been crafted to speed up workflow of processing datasets in bulk and to allow<br />\r\nfor easy modification of algorithm’s parameters. In PartSeg we also include the first public<br />\r\nimplementation of Multi-scale Opening algorithm descibed in [1]. PartSeg allows for<br />\r\nsegmentation in 3D based on finding connected components. The segmentation results can be<br />\r\ncorrected manually to adjust for high noise in the data. Then, it is possible to calculate some<br />\r\nstandard statistics like volume, mass, diameter and their user-defined combinations for the<br />\r\nresults of the segmentation. Finally, it is possible to superimpose segmented structures using<br />\r\nweighted PCA method. Conclusions: PartSeg is a comprehensive and flexible software<br />\r\ndedicated to help biologists in processing, segmentation, visualization and the analysis of the<br />\r\nlarge microscopic 3D image data. PartSeg provides well established algorithms in an easy-touse,<br />\r\nintuitive, user-friendly toolbox without sacrificing their power and flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples include Chromosome territory analysis.</p>\r\n",
