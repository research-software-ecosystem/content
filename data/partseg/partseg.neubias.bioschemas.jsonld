  "http://schema.org/description": "There are many methods in bio-imaging that can be parametrized. This gives more flexibility\r\nto the user as long as tools provide easy support for tuning parameters. On the other hand, the\r\ndatasets of interest constantly grow which creates the need to process them in bulk. Again,\r\nthis requires proper tool support, if biologist is going to be able to organize such bulk\r\nprocessing in an ad-hoc manner without the help of a programmer. Finally, new image\r\nanalysis algorithms are being constantly created and updated. Yet, lots of work is necessary to\r\nextend a prototype implementation into product for the users. Therefore, there is a growing\r\nneed for software with a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes the process of image\r\nanalysis easier to perform and at the same time allows for high throughput analysis of raw\r\ndata using batch processing and novel algorithms. Main program in this area are written in\r\nJava, but Python grow in bioinformatics and will be nice to allow easy wrap algorithm written\r\nin this language.\r\nHere we present PartSeg, a comprehensive software package implementing several image\r\nprocessing algorithms that can be used for analysis of microscopic 3D images. Its user\r\ninterface has been crafted to speed up workflow of processing datasets in bulk and to allow\r\nfor easy modification of algorithm’s parameters. In PartSeg we also include the first public\r\nimplementation of Multi-scale Opening algorithm descibed in [1]. PartSeg allows for\r\nsegmentation in 3D based on finding connected components. The segmentation results can be\r\ncorrected manually to adjust for high noise in the data. Then, it is possible to calculate some\r\nstandard statistics like volume, mass, diameter and their user-defined combinations for the\r\nresults of the segmentation. Finally, it is possible to superimpose segmented structures using\r\nweighted PCA method. Conclusions: PartSeg is a comprehensive and flexible software\r\ndedicated to help biologists in processing, segmentation, visualization and the analysis of the\r\nlarge microscopic 3D image data. PartSeg provides well established algorithms in an easy-touse,\r\nintuitive, user-friendly toolbox without sacrificing their power and flexibility.\n \nExamples include Chromosome territory analysis.\n",
