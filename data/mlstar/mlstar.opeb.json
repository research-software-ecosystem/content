It also works as an interface between PubMLST through their RESTful API, so you don't have to bother downloading and collecting files: the application does it automatically. Today the package works in Unix-based systems.\n\nIf you use MLSTar in your publications, please cite:.\n\nNote: cgMLST and wgMLST are not yet fully supported since the RESTful API interphase for theses cases is a little different than the one for the standard 7 loci schemes.
