We developed this server for helping researchers to enhance their own low-resolution data by a few steps of clicks. Ab initio training could be performed according to our published code. We provided trained models for various depth of low-coverage sequencing Hi-C data. The depth of input data is estimated by its distribution comparing with those of the downsampled Hi-C data we used in training.",
