    "description": "DeepHiC is a GAN-based model for enhancing Hi-C data resolution. We developed this server for helping researchers to enhance their own low-resolution data by a few steps of clicks. Ab initio training could be performed according to our published code. We provided trained models for various depth of low-coverage sequencing Hi-C data. The depth of input data is estimated by its distribution comparing with those of the downsampled Hi-C data we used in training.",

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Hi-C is commonly used to study three-dimensional genome organization. However, due to the high sequencing cost and technical constraints, the resolution of most Hi-C datasets is coarse, resulting in a loss of information and biological interpretability. Here we develop DeepHiC, a generative adversarial network, to predict high-resolution Hi-C contact maps from low-coverage sequencing data. We demonstrated that DeepHiC is capable of reproducing high-resolution Hi-C data from as few as 1% downsampled reads. Empowered by adversarial training, our method can restore fine-grained details similar to those in high-resolution Hi-C matrices, boosting accuracy in chromatin loops identification and TADs detection, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in accuracy of prediction. Finally, application of DeepHiC to Hi-C data on mouse embryonic development can facilitate chromatin loop detection. We develop a web-based tool (DeepHiC, http://sysomics.com/ deephic) that allows researchers to enhance their own Hi-C data with just a few clicks.",
