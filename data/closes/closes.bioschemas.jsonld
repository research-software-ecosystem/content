      "sc:description": "A platform for closed-loop intracranial stimulation in humans.\n\nTargeted interrogation of brain networks through invasive brain stimulation has become an increasingly important research tool as well as a therapeutic modality. The majority of work with this emerging capability has been focused on open-loop approaches. Closed-loop techniques, however, could improve neuromodulatory therapies and research investigations by optimizing stimulation approaches using neurally informed, personalized targets. Specifically, closed-loop direct electrical stimulation tests in humans performed during semi-chronic electrode implantation in patients with refractory epilepsy could help deepen our understanding of basic research questions as well as the mechanisms and treatment solutions for many neuropsychiatric diseases. However, implementing closed-loop systems is challenging",
