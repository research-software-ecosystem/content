It enables researchers to build their own server in simple steps, run almost out-of-the-box scripts to annotate and curate their proteins, analyze their data via a user-friendly online interface, and utilize plugins to extend the functionality of server. It is expected to support researcher productivity and facilitate data sharing in the new era of structural proteomics.",
