Results: We present a novel approach based on large margin learning that combines accurate splice site predictions with common sequence alignment techniques. By solving a convex optimization problem, our algorithm - called PALMA - tunes the parameters of the model such that true alignments score higher than other alignments. We study the accuracy of alignments of mRNAs containing artificially generated micro-exons to genomic DNA. In a carefully designed experiment, we show that our algorithm accurately identifies the intron boundaries as well as boundaries of the optimal local alignment. It outperforms all other methods: for 5702 artificially shortened EST sequences from Caenorhabditis elegans and human, it correctly identifies the intron boundaries in all except two cases. The best other method is a recently proposed method called exalin which misaligns 37 of the sequences. Our method also demonstrates robustness to mutations, insertions and deletions, retaining accuracy even at high noise levels. \u00a9 2007 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 9, "authors": [{"name": "Schulze U."}, {"name": "Hepp B."}, {"name": "Ong C.S."}, {"name": "Ratsch G."}], "date": "2007-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Uta Schulze", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Uta.Schulze@tuebingen.mpg.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:palma", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/palma", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A novel approach based on large margin learning that combines accurate splice site predictions with common sequence alignment techniques.
