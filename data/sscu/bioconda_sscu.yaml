description: The package calculates the indexes for selective stength in codon usage
  in bacteria species. (1) The package can calculate the strength of selected codon
  usage bias (sscu, also named as s_index) based on Paul Sharp's method. The method
  take into account of background mutation rate, and focus only on four pairs of codons
  with universal translational advantages in all bacterial species. Thus the sscu
  index is comparable among different species. (2) The package can detect the strength
  of translational accuracy selection by Akashi's test. The test tabulating all codons
  into four categories with the feature as conserved/variable amino acids and optimal/non-optimal
  codons. (3) Optimal codon lists (selected codons) can be calculated by either op_highly
  function (by using the highly expressed genes compared with all genes to identify
  optimal codons), or op_corre_CodonW/op_corre_NCprime function (by correlative method
  developed by Hershberg & Petrov). Users will have a list of optimal codons for further
  analysis, such as input to the Akashi's test. (4) The detailed codon usage information,
  such as RSCU value, number of optimal codons in the highly/all gene set, as well
  as the genomic gc3 value, can be calculate by the optimal_codon_statistics and genomic_gc3
  function. (5) Furthermore, we added one test function low_frequency_op in the package.
  The function try to find the low frequency optimal codons, among all the optimal
  codons identified by the op_highly function.
