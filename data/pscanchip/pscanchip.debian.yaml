description: Regulation of transcription is one of the main check points of gene expression
  regulation and plays a key role in fundamental processes like cellular differentiation
  and dynamic molecular responses to stimuli The transcriptional activity of genes
  is finely regulated by the interaction of sequence elements on the DNA (transcription
  factor binding sites or TFBSs) and particular proteins called Transcription Factors
  (TFs). , TFBSs are usually clustered in specific regulatory genomic regions called
  promoters and enhancers. TFs usually recognize TFBSs in a loose sequence specific
  fashion but there is no computational way to determine if any given sequence motif
  on the DNA is actually bound in-vivo by a TF, even when the motif is an istance
  of the sequences typically bound by the TF itself. . Tools like Pscan and PscanChIP
  analyse a set of regulatory sequences to detect motif enrichment. The rationale
  is that if a given TFBS is present in a "surpisingly high" number of istances then
  there is a good chance that the TF that recognize that motif is a common regulator
  of the input sequences, thus they use redundancy as an information source. . While
  Pscan (of the pscan-tfbs package) is tailored to work on promoters, that is the
  regulatory regions upstream of transcription start sites, PscanChIP is suited to
  work on more general regulatory genomic regions like the ones identified through
  ChIP-Seq experiments.
