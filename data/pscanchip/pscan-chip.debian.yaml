  description: ChIP-based identifcation of TF binding sites
  long_description: " Regulation of transcription is one of the main check points
    of gene\n expression regulation and plays a key role in fundamental processes
    like\n cellular differentiation and dynamic molecular responses to stimuli The\n
    transcriptional activity of genes is finely regulated by the interaction\n of
    sequence elements on the DNA (transcription factor binding sites or\n TFBSs) and
    particular proteins called Transcription Factors (TFs).\n ,\n TFBSs are usually
    clustered in specific regulatory genomic regions\n called promoters and enhancers.
    TFs usually recognize TFBSs in a loose\n sequence specific fashion but there is
    no computational way to determine\n if any given sequence motif on the DNA is
    actually bound in-vivo by a\n TF, even when the motif is an istance of the sequences
    typically bound\n by the TF itself.\n .\n Tools like Pscan and PscanChIP analyse
    a set of regulatory sequences\n to detect motif enrichment. The rationale is that
    if a given TFBS is\n present in a \"surpisingly high\" number of istances then
    there is a good\n chance that the TF that recognize that motif is a common regulator
    of\n the input sequences, thus they use redundancy as an information source.\n
    .\n While Pscan (of the pscan-tfbs package) is tailored to work on promoters,\n
    that is the regulatory regions upstream of transcription start sites,\n PscanChIP
    is suited to work on more general regulatory genomic regions\n like the ones identified
    through ChIP-Seq experiments.\n"
