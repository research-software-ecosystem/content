A cell's function is influenced by the environment, or niche, in which it resides. Studies of niches usually require assumptions about the cell types present, which impedes the discovery of new cell types or interactions. Here we describe ProximID, an approach for building a cellular network based on physical cell interaction and single-cell mRNA sequencing, and show that it can be used to discover new preferential cellular interactions without prior knowledge of component cell types. ProximID found specific interactions between megakaryocytes and mature neutrophils and between plasma cells and myeloblasts and/or promyelocytes (precursors of neutrophils) in mouse bone marrow, and it identified a Tac1 + enteroendocrine cell-Lgr5 + stem cell interaction in small intestine crypts. This strategy can be used to discover new niches or preferential interactions in a variety of organs.","authors":["Boisset J.-C.","Vivie J.","Grun D.","Muraro M.J.","Lyubimova A.","Van Oudenaarden A."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1038/s41592-018-0009-z","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Mapping the physical network of cellular interactions","year":"2018-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:proximid","biotoolsID":"proximid","description":"An approach for building a cellular network based on physical cell interaction and single-cell mRNA sequencing (for cell type identification).
