      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Removal of aqueous fluoroquinolones with multi-functional activated carbon (MFAC) derived from recycled long-root Eichhornia crassipes | Fluoroquinolones (FQs) occur broadly in natural media due to its extensive use, and it has systematic effects on our ecosystem and human immunity. In this study, long-root Eichhornia crassipes was reclaimed as a multi-functional activated carbon (MFAC) to remove fluoroquinolones (FQs) from contaminated water. To get insight into the adsorption mechanism, multiple measurements, including FTIR and XPS analyses, were employed to investigate the adsorption processes of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin as well as the experiments of effect of exogenous factors on adsorption performances. The results confirmed that the adsorption of FQs by MFAC was mainly attributed to the electrostatic interaction, hydrogen bond interaction, and electronic-donor-acceptor (EDA) interaction",
