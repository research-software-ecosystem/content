    "description": "Fuzzy modeling and global optimization to predict novel therapeutic targets in cancer cells.\n\nMOTIVATION:The elucidation of dysfunctional cellular processes that can induce the onset of a disease is a challenging issue from both experimental and computational perspectives. Here we introduce a novel computational method based on the coupling between fuzzy logic modeling and a global optimization algorithm, whose aims are to (1) predict the emergent dynamical behaviors of highly heterogeneous systems in unperturbed and perturbed conditions, regardless the availability of quantitative parameters, (2) determine a minimal set of system components whose perturbation can lead to a desired system response, therefore facilitating the design of a more appropriate experimental strategy. RESULTS:We applied this method to investigate what drives K-ras induced cancer cells, displaying the typical Warburg effect, to death or survival upon progressive glucose depletion",
