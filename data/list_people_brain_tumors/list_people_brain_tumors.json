    "description": "Interesting different survival status of musicians with malignant cerebral tumors.\n\nList of people with brain tumors.\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.\n\nJump to navigation Jump to search.\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries.\n\nA brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, and can be cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10\u201330% of all people with cancer.[1].\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'musicians malign cerebral tumors music'",
