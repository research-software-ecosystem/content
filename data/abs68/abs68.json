    "description": "Use of a call centre to conduct clinical research.\n\nIntroduction:Call centres are increasingly utilised to provide health-care services and advice. Their use in research to monitor and track individuals with long-term health conditions such as asthma without subjecting them to regular clinic visits has yet to be validated. Aim:As part of an asthma health outcomes study a call centre conducted monthly interviews with patients over one year. The relationship between the research team and the call centre, as well as data quality, was reviewed. Method:344 patients from 31 randomly selected UK practices were called on a monthly basis.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME (ABS68) SIMILAR TO (PUB. DIFFERENT) bio.tools/abs (ABS).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'monthly', 'interviews', 'interview', 'monthly interviews'",
