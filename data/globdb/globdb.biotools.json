    "description": "A dereplicated set of species representative microbial genomes. The genomic era offers great opportunities for microbial genome analyses, and individual (meta)genome studies can generate thousands of microbial genomes. Although the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) databases are available to store these datasets, depositing assembled and binned metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) to INSDC databases doesn't always happen. The GlobDB aims to integrate 14 genome resources that are currently not (yet) consolidated otherwise.\nThe GTDB species representatives are the base of the GlobDB, and the other 13 datasets extend upon this. The GlobDB follows the annual GTDB release schedule. The  GlobDB release 226 contains more than double the number of species-representative genomes (306 260) compared to the GTDB release 226 species representative set (143 614).",
