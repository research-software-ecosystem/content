description: "Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It\
  \ implements the Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al in preparation) and some\
  \ other simple algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model for\
  \ aggregation that is robust to noise and also facilitates the calculation of significance\
  \ probabilities for all the elements in the final ranking.\n"
