description: Methods for aggregating ranked lists, especially lists of genes. It implements
  the Robust Rank Aggregation (Kolde et. al in preparation) and some other simple
  algorithms for the task. RRA method uses a probabilistic model for aggregation that
  is robust to noise and also facilitates the calculation of significance probabilities
  for all the elements in the final ranking.
