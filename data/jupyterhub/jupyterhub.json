    "description": "Jupyter notebooks in science gateways.\n\nJupyter Notebooks empower scientists to create executable documents that include text, equations, code and figures. Notebooks are a simple way to create reproducible and shareable workflows. The Jupyter developers have also released a multi-user notebook environment: Jupyterhub. Jupyterhub provides an extensible platform for handling user authentication and spawning the Notebook application to each user. I developed a plugin for Jupyterhub to spawn notebooks on a Supercomputer and integrated the authentication with CILogon and XSEDE. Scientists can authenticate on their browser and connect to a Jupyter Notebook instance running on the computing node of a Supercomputer, in my test deployment SDSC Comet. Jupyterhub can benefit Science Gateways by providing an expressive interface to a centralized environment with many software tools pre-installed and allow scientists to access Gateway functionality via web API.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
