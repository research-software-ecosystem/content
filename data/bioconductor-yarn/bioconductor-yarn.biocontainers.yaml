description: The package enables users to expedite large rna-seq analyses using a
  combination of previously developed tools. it is meant to make it easier for the
  user in performing basic mis-annotation quality control, filtering, and condition-aware
  normalization, leveraging many bioconductor tools and statistical techniques to
  account for the large heterogeneity and sparsity found in very large rna-seq experiments.
