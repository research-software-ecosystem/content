description: R package designed to streamline the visualization of molecular effects
  in regulatory cascades. it utilizes the r package htmltools and a modified sankey
  plugin of the javascript library d3 to provide a fast and easy, browser-enabled
  solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream effects of regulatory
  and/or co-expressed molecules. the diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged
  as highly-portable html files that eliminate the need for third-party software to
  view.
