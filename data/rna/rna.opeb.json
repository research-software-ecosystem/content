The mandatory first step for a wide range of analyses is the alignment of the sequences against a reference genome. We present a major update to our rNA (randomized Numerical Aligner) tool. The main feature of rNA is the fact that it achieves an accuracy greater than the majority of other tools in a feasible amount of time. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.
