biotools_id: crisprseek
description: The package includes functions to find potential guide RNAs for input
  target sequences, optionally filter guide RNAs without restriction enzyme cut site,
  or without paired guide RNAs, genome-wide search for off-targets, score, rank, fetch
  flank sequence and indicate whether the target and off-targets are located in exon
  region or not. Potential guide RNAs are annotated with total score of the top5 and
  topN off-targets, detailed topN mismatch sites, restriction enzyme cut sites, and
  paired guide RNAs. This package leverages Biostrings and BSgenome packages.
