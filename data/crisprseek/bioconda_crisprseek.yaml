biotools_id: crisprseek
description: The package includes functions to find potential guide RNAs for the CRISPR
  editing system including Base Editors and the Prime Editor for input target sequences,
  optionally filter guide RNAs without restriction enzyme cut site, or without paired
  guide RNAs, genome-wide search for off-targets, score, rank, fetch flank sequence
  and indicate whether the target and off-targets are located in exon region or not.
  Potential guide RNAs are annotated with total score of the top5 and topN off-targets,
  detailed topN mismatch sites, restriction enzyme cut sites, and paired guide RNAs.
  The package also output indels and their frequencies for Cas9 targeted sites.
