                "abstract": "This paper describes a method Pprint2, which is an improved version of Pprint developed for predicting RNA-interacting residues in a protein. Training and independent/validation datasets used in this study comprises of 545 and 161 non-redundant RNA-binding proteins, respectively. All models were trained on training dataset and evaluated on the validation dataset. The preliminary analysis reveals that positively charged amino acids such as H, R and K, are more prominent in the RNA-interacting residues. Initially, machine learning based models have been developed using binary profile and obtain maximum area under curve (AUC) 0.68 on validation dataset. The performance of this model improved significantly from AUC 0.68 to 0.76, when evolutionary profile is used instead of binary profile. The performance of our evolutionary profile-based model improved further from AUC 0.76 to 0.82, when convolutional neural network has been used for developing model. Our final model based on convolutional neural network using evolutionary information achieved AUC 0.82 with Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.49 on the validation dataset. Our best model outperforms existing methods when evaluated on the independent/validation dataset. A user-friendly standalone software and web-based server named 'Pprint2' has been developed for predicting RNA-interacting residues (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/pprint2 and https://github.com/raghavagps/ pprint2).",
