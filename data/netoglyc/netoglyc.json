The specificity seems to be modulated by sequence context, secondary structure and surface accessibility. The sequence context of glycosylated threonines was found to differ from that of serine, and the sites were found to cluster. Non-clustered sites had a sequence context different from that of clustered sites. Charged residues were disfavoured at position - 1 and +3. A jury of artificial neural networks was trained to recognize the sequence context and surface accessibility of 299 known and verified mucin type O-glycosylation sites extracted from O- GLYCBASE. The cross-validated NetOglyc network system correctly found 83% of the glycosylated and 90% of the non-glycosylated serine and threonine residues in independent test sets, thus proving more accurate than matrix statistics and vector projection methods. Predictions of O-glycosylation sites in the envelope glycoprotein gp120 from the primate lentiviruses HIV- 1, HIV-2 and SIV are presented. The most conserved O-glycosylation signals in these evolutionary-related glycoproteins were found in their first hypervariable loop, V1. However, the strain variation for HIV-1 gp120 was significant. A computer server, available through WWW or E-mail, has been developed for prediction of mucin type O-glycosylation sites in proteins based on the amino acid sequence.",

Pattern recognition by artificial neural networks and weight matrix algorithms was performed to determine the exact position of in vivo O-linked GalNAc-glycosylated serine and threonine residues from the primary sequence exclusively. The acceptor sequence context for O-glycosylation of serine was found to differ from that of threonine and the two types were therefore treated separately. The context of the sites showed a high abundance of proline, serine and threonine extending far beyond the previously reported region covering positions -4 through +4 relative to the glycosylated residue. The O-glycosylation sites were found to cluster and to have a high abundance in the N-terminal part of the protein. The sites were also found to have an increased preference for three different classes of \u03b2-turns. No simple consensus-like rule could be deduced for the complex glycosylation sequence acceptor patterns. The neural networks were trained on the hitherto largest data material consisting of 48 carefully examined mammalian glycoproteins comprising 264 O-glycosylation sites. For detection neural network algorithms were much more reliable than weight matrices. The networks correctly found 60-95% of the O-glycosylated serine/threonine residues and 88-97% of the non-glycosylated residues in two independent test sets of known glycoproteins. A computer server using E-mail for prediction of O-glycosylation sites has been implemented and made publicly available.",
