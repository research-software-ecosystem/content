Gene expression domains from raw images are extracted and integrated spatially into a set of standard 3D virtual mouse embryos at different stages, allowing data interrogation by spatial methods. An anatomy ontology is also used to describe sites of expression, data can be queried using text-based methods. Data coverage has been increased by sourcing from a greater selection of journals.",
