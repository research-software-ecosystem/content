  "sc:description": "Twinscan is a system for predicting gene-structure in eukaryotic genomic sequences. In order to make its predictions, Twinscan combines the information from predicted coding regions and splice sites with conserservation measurements between the target sequence and sequences from a closely related genome. Currently sequences from mammalian genomes, and those of Arabidopsis thaliana, C. elegans, C. briggsae and strains JEC21 and H99 of Cryptococcus neoformans can be processed using Twinscan.",
