    "description": "a Spatial Data Infrastructure dedicated to noise monitoring based on volunteers measurements.\n\nThe present paper proposes an ideal Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) dedicated to noise monitoring based on volunteers measurements. Called OnoM@P, it takes advantage of the geospatial standards and open source tools to build an integrated platform to manage the whole knowledge about a territory and to observe its dynamics. It intends also to diffuse good practices to organize, collect, represent and process geospatial data in field of acoustic researches. OnoM@p falls within the framework of the Environmental Noise Directive (END) 2002 49 CE. The system relies on the NoiseCapture Android application developed for allowing each citizen to estimate its own noise exposure with its smartphone.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
