RNA-Seq experiments are able to generate huge amounts of transcriptome sequence reads at a fraction of the cost of Sanger sequencing. Reads produced by these technologies are relatively short and error prone. To utilize such reads for transcriptome reconstruction and gene-structure identification, one needs to be able to accurately align the sequence reads over intron boundaries. In this unit, we describe PALMapper, a fast and easy-to-use tool that is designed to accurately compute both unspliced and spliced alignments for millions of RNA-Seq reads. It combines the efficient read mapper GenomeMapper with the spliced aligner QPALMA, which exploits read-quality information and predictions of splice sites to improve the alignment accuracy. The PALMapper package is available as a command-line tool running on Unix or Mac OS X systems or through a Web interface based on Galaxy tools. © 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","authors":["Jean G.","Kahles A.","Sreedharan V.T.","De Bona F.","Ratsch G."],"cit_count":36,"journal":"Current Protocols in Bioinformatics","pmid":"21154708","title":"RNA-seq read alignments with PALMapper","year":"2010-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:palmapper","biotoolsID":"palmapper","description":"A tool for aligning RNA-Seq reads.
