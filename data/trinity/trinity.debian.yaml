description: 'Trinity represents a novel method for the efficient and robust de novo
  reconstruction of transcriptomes from RNA-seq data. Trinity combines three independent
  software modules: Inchworm, Chrysalis, and Butterfly, applied sequentially to process
  large volumes of RNA-seq reads. Trinity partitions the sequence data into many individual
  de Bruijn graphs, each representing the transcriptional complexity at a given gene
  or locus, and then processes each graph independently to extract full-length splicing
  isoforms and to tease apart transcripts derived from paralogous genes.'
