The mode of interaction between biologists and on-line information resources, however, has been mostly limited to simple interface technologies such has hypertext links, tables and forms. The introduction of platform-independent runtime environments facilitates the development of more sophisticated WWW-based user interfaces. Until recently, most such interfaces have been tightly coupled to the underlying computation engines, and not separated as reusable components. We believe that many subdisciplines of biology have intuitive and familiar graphical representations of knowledge that can serve as multipurpose user interface elements. We call such graphical idioms 'domain graphics'. In order to illustrate the power of such graphics, we have built a reusable interface based on the standard two dimensional (2D) layout of RNA secondary structure. The interface can be used to represent any pre-computed layout of RNA, and takes as a parameters the sets of actions to be performed as a user interacts with the interface. It can provide to any associated application program information about the base, helix, or subsequence selected by the user. We show the versatility of this interface by using it as a special purpose interface to BLAST, Medline and the RNA MFOLD search/compute engines.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Felciano R.M."}, {"name": "Chen R.O."}, {"name": "Altman R.B."}], "date": "1997-06-07T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Gene"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "SStructView Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "sstructview@smi.stanford.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sstructview", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://www.ctu.edu.vn/~dvxe/Bioinformatic/Software/BIT%20Software/home.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0278"}, {"term": "Structure visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0570"}, {"term": "RNA secondary structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0502"}, {"term": "RNA secondary structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2439"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "RNA secondary structure viewer applet; must be integrated into web page to be implemented; can link to multiple computational backends.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "sstructview", "additionDate": "2017-05-02T10:00:55Z", "name": "SStructView", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://www.ctu.edu.vn/~dvxe/Bioinformatic/Software/BIT%20Software/docs.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
