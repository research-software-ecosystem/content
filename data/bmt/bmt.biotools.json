                "abstract": "© 2020 Elsevier Inc.Background Bioinformatics tools are of great significance and are used in different spheres of life sciences. There are wide variety of tools available to perform primary analysis of DNA and protein but most of them are available on different platforms and many remain undetected. Accessing these tools separately to perform individual task is uneconomical and inefficient. Objective Our aim is to bring different bioinformatics models on a single platform to ameliorate scientific research. Hence, our objective is to make a tool for comprehensive DNA and protein analysis. Methods To develop a reliable, straight-forward and standalone desktop application we used state of the art python packages and libraries. Bioinformatics Mini Toolbox (BMT) is combination of seven tools including FastqTrimmer, Gene Prediction, DNA Analysis, Translation, Protein analysis and Pairwise and Multiple alignment. Results FastqTrimmer assists in quality assurance of NGS data. Gene prediction predicts the genes by homology from novel genome on the basis of reference sequence. Protein analysis and DNA analysis calculates physiochemical properties of nucleotide and protein sequences, respectively. Translation translates the DNA sequence into six open reading frames. Pairwise alignment performs pairwise global and local alignment of DNA and protein sequences on the basis or multiple matrices. Multiple alignment aligns multiple sequences and generates a phylogenetic tree. Conclusion We developed a tool for comprehensive DNA and protein analysis.
