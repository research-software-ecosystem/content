                "abstract": "© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Inference of cancer-causing genes and their biological functions are crucial but challenging due to the heterogeneity of somatic mutations. The heterogeneity of somatic mutations reveals that only a handful of oncogenes mutate frequently and a number of cancer-causing genes mutate rarely. Results: We develop a Cytoscape app, named ZDOG, for visualization of the extent to which mutated genes may affect cancer pathways using the dominating tree model. The dominator tree model allows us to examine conveniently the positional importance of a gene in cancer signalling pathways. This tool facilitates the identification of mutated \"master\" regulators even with low mutation frequency in deregulated signalling pathways. Conclusions: We have presented a model for facilitating the examination of the extent to which mutation in a gene may affect downstream components in a signalling pathway through its positional information. The model is implemented in a user-friendly Cytoscape app which will be freely available upon publication. Availability: Together with a user manual, the ZDOG app is freely available at GitHub (https://github.com/rudi2013/ZDOG). It is also available in the Cytoscape app store (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/ZDOG) and users can easily install it using the Cytoscape App Manager.",
