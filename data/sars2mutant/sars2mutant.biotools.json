                "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is a highly pathogenic viral infection of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), resulted in the global pandemic of 2020. A lack of therapeutic and preventive strategies has quickly posed significant threats to world health. A comprehensive understanding of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and natural selection, how it impacts host interaction, and phenotype symptoms is vital to develop effective strategies against the virus. The SARS2Mutant database (http://sars2mutant.com/) was developed to provide valuable insights based on millions of high-quality, high-coverage SARS-CoV-2 complete protein sequences. Users of this database have the ability to search for information on three amino acid substitution mutation strategies based on gene name, geographical zone, or comparative analysis. Each strategy is presented in five distinct formats which includes: (i) mutated sample frequencies, (ii) heat maps of mutated amino acid positions, (iii) mutation survivals, (iv) natural selections and (v) details of substituted amino acids, including their names, positions, and frequencies. GISAID is a primary database of genomics sequencies of influenza viruses updated daily. SARS2Mutant is a secondary database developed to discover mutation and conserved regions from the primary data to assist with design for targeted vaccine, primer, and drug discoveries.",
