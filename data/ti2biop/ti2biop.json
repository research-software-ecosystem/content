Its practical use to unravel cryptic bacteriocin-like domains", "abstract": "Bacteriocins are proteinaceous toxins produced and exported by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria as a defense mechanism. The bacteriocin protein family is highly diverse, which complicates the identification of bacteriocin-like sequences using alignment approaches. The use of topological indices (TIs) irrespective of sequence similarity can be a promising alternative to predict proteinaceous bacteriocins. Thus, we present Topological Indices to BioPolymers (TI2BioP) as an alignment-free approach inspired in both the Topological Substructural Molecular Design (TOPS-MODE) and Markov Chain Invariants for Network Selection and Design (MARCH-INSIDE) methodology. TI2BioP allows the calculation of the spectral moments as simple TIs to seek quantitative sequence-function relationships (QSFR) models. Since hydrophobicity and basicity are major criteria for the bactericide activity of bacteriocins, the spectral moments (HP\u03bc k ) were derived for the first time from protein artificial secondary structures based on amino acid clustering into a Cartesian system of hydrophobicity and polarity. Several orders of HP\u03bc k characterized numerically 196 bacteriocin-like sequences and a control group made up of 200 representative CATH domains. Subsequently, they were used to develop an alignment-free QSFR model allowing a 76.92% discrimination of bacteriocin proteins from other domains, a relevant result considering the high sequence diversity among the members of both groups. The model showed a prediction overall performance of 72.16%, detecting specifically 66.7% of proteinaceous bacteriocins whereas the InterProScan retrieved just 60.2%. As a practical validation, the model also predicted successfully the cryptic bactericide function of the Cry 1Ab C-terminal domain from Bacillus thuringiensis's endotoxin, which has not been detected by classical alignment methods. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Aguero-Chapin G."}, {"name": "Perez-Machado G."}, {"name": "Molina-Ruiz R."}, {"name": "Perez-Castillo Y."}, {"name": "Morales-Helguera A."}, {"name": "Vasconcelos V."}, {"name": "Antunes A."}], "date": "2011-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Amino Acids"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.ciimar.up.pt/lege/en/index.htm", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "cmia@cm-matosinhos.pt"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ti2biop", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/ti2biop/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Spectral counting", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3637"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool allows the calculation of the spectral moments derived from inferred and artificial 2D structures of DNA, RNA and proteins being possible to carry out a structure-function correlation using such sequence/structure numerical indices.", "toolType": ["Desktop application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python", "Delphi"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/ti2biop-2-0-topological-indices-biopolymers.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "ti2biop", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:02:45Z", "name": "TI2BioP", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/ti2biop/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Windows"]}
