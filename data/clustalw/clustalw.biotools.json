The method is based on first deriving a phylogenetic tree from a matrix of all pairwise sequence similarity scores, obtained using a fast pairwise alignment algorithm. Then the multiple alignment is achieved from a series of pairwise alignments of clusters of sequences, following the order of branching in the tree. The method is sufficiently fast and economical with memory to be easily implemented on a microcomputer, and yet the results obtained are comparable to those from packages requiring mainframe computer facilities. \u00a9 1988.",
