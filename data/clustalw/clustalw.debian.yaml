description: "This program performs an alignment of multiple nucleotide or amino acid\
  \ sequences. It recognizes the format of input sequences and whether the sequences\
  \ are nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) or amino acid (proteins). The output format may be\
  \ selected from in various formats for multiple alignments such as Phylip or FASTA.\
  \ Clustal\_W is very well accepted. . The output of Clustal\_W can be edited manually\
  \ but preferably with an alignment editor like SeaView or within its companion Clustal\_\
  X. When building a model from your alignment, this can be applied for improved database\
  \ searches. The Debian package hmmer creates such in form of an HMM.\n"
