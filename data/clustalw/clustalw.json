The method is based on first deriving a phylogenetic tree from a matrix of all pairwise sequence similarity scores, obtained using a fast pairwise alignment algorithm. Then the multiple alignment is achieved from a series of pairwise alignments of clusters of sequences, following the order of branching in the tree. The method is sufficiently fast and economical with memory to be easily implemented on a microcomputer, and yet the results obtained are comparable to those from packages requiring mainframe computer facilities. \u00a9 1988.", "citationCount": 2727, "authors": [{"name": "Higgins D.G."}, {"name": "Sharp P.M."}], "date": "1988-12-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Gene"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Clustal helpdesk", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Division", "email": "clustalw@ucd.ie"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:clustalw", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.8 - 1.83"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.clustal.org/download/1.X/ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Multiple sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0492"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_0863"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2020-02-09T15:03:41.556892Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Multiple sequence alignment software.
