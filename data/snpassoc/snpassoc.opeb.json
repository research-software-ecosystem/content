Although the analysis of individual SNPs is a relatively trivial task, when the number is large and multiple genetic models need to be explored it becomes necessary a tool to automate the analyses. In order to address this issue, we developed SNPassoc, an R package to carry out most common analyses in whole genome association studies. These analyses include descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis of missing values, calculation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, analysis of association based on generalized linear models (either for quantitative or binary traits), and analysis of multiple SNPs (haplotype and epistasis analysis). © 2007 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Gonzalez J.R.","Armengol L.","Sole X.","Guino E.","Mercader J.M.","Estivill X.","Moreno V."],"cit_count":443,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"17267436","title":"SNPassoc: An R package to perform whole genome association studies","year":"2007-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:snpassoc","biotoolsID":"snpassoc","description":"The tool contains classes and methods to help the analysis of whole genome association studies.
