When applied to a dataset containing 103 families, Hapi performs 3.8 and 320 times faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. Because Hapi infers both minimum-recombinant and maximum likelihood haplotypes and applies to related individuals, the haplotypes it infers are highly accurate over extended genomic distances © 2010 Williams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Williams A.L.","Housman D.E.","Rinard M.C.","Gifford D.K."],"cit_count":11,"doi":"10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r108","journal":"Genome Biology","title":"Rapid haplotype inference for nuclear families","type":"Primary","year":"2010-10-29"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:hapi","biotoolsID":"hapi","description":"Hapi is a program that efficiently infers minimum recombinant and maximum likelihood haplotypes for nuclear families.","homepage":"http://hapi.csail.mit.edu/","name":"Hapi","version":["1.03"]}}
