summary: post-processing of high-throughput DNA sequence reads
description: >
   skewer implements the bit-masked k-difference matching algorithm
   dedicated to the task of adapter trimming and it is specially designed
   for processing next-generation sequencing (NGS) paired-end sequences.
   .
   Features
   .
    * Detection and removal of adapter sequences
    * Insertion and deletion allowed in pattern matching
    * Targeted at Single End, Paired End (PE), and Long Mate Pair (LMP) reads
    * Demultiplexing of barcoded sequencing runs
    * Multi-threading support
    * Trimming based on phred quality scores
    * IUPAC characters for barcodes and adapters
    * Compressed input and output support
version: 0.2.2
