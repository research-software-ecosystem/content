description: "This package offers a GUI interface for the Clustal multiple sequence\
  \ alignment program. It provides an integrated environment for performing multiple\
  \ sequence- and profile-alignments to analyse the results. The sequence alignment\
  \ is displayed in a window on the screen. A versatile coloring scheme has been incorporated\
  \ to highlight conserved features in the alignment. For professional presentations,\
  \ one should use the texshade LaTeX package or boxshade. . The pull-down menus at\
  \ the top of the window allow you to select all the options required for traditional\
  \ multiple sequence and profile alignment. You can cut-and-paste sequences to change\
  \ the order of the alignment; you can select a subset of sequences to be aligned;\
  \ you can select a sub-range of the alignment to be realigned and inserted back\
  \ into the original alignment. . An alignment quality analysis can be performed\
  \ and low-scoring segments or exceptional residues can be highlighted.\n"
