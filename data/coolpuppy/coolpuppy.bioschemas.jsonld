      "sc:description": "coolpup.py is a versatile Python tool to perform pile-up analysis on Hi-C data in .cool format. coolpup.py is particularly well suited performance-wise for analysing huge numbers of potential interactions, since it loads whole chromosomes into memory one by one (or in parallel to speed it up) to extract small submatrices quickly. Having to read everything into memory makes it relatively slow for small numbers of loops, but performance doesn't decrease until you reach a huge number of interactions.",
