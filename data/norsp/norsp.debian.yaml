description: NORSp is a publicly available predictor for disordered regions in proteins.
  Specifically, it predicts long regions with no regular secondary structure. Upon
  submission of a protein sequence, NORSp analyses the protein about its secondary
  structure, the presence of transmembrane helices and coiled-coils. It then returns
  the presence and position of disordered regions. . NORSp can be useful for biologists
  in several ways. For example, crystallographers can check whether their proteins
  contain NORS regions and make the decision about whether to proceed with the experiments
  since NORS proteins may be difficult to crystallise, as demonstrated by the their
  low occurrence in PDB. Biologists interested in protein structure-function relationship
  may also find it interesting to verify whether the protein-protein interaction sites
  coincide with NORS regions.
