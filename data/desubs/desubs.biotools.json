It contains framework covering a broad range of operation modes at all stages of the subpathway analysis, enabling a case-specific approach. The operation modes refer to the pathway network construction and processing, the subpathway extraction, visualization and enrichment analysis with regard to various biological and pharmacological features.",

For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.DEsubs is a network-based systems biology R package that extracts disease-perturbed subpathways within a pathway network as recorded by RNA-seq experiments. It contains an extensive and customized framework with a broad range of operation modes at all stages of the subpathway analysis, enabling so a case-specific approach. The operation modes include pathway network construction and processing, subpathway extraction, visualization and enrichment analysis with regard to various biological and pharmacological features. Its capabilities render DEsubs a tool-guide for both the modeler and experimentalist for the identification of more robust systems-level drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DEsubs is implemented as an R package following Bioconductor guidelines: http://bioconductor.org/packages/DEsubs/ CONTACT: tassos.bezerianos@nus.edu.sgSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
