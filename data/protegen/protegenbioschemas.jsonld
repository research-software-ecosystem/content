Protegen includes basic antigen information and experimental evidence curated from peer-reviewed articles. It also includes detailed gene/protein information (e.g. DNA and protein sequences, and COG classification). Different antigen features, such as protein weight and pI, and subcellular localizations of bacterial proteins are precomputed.",
