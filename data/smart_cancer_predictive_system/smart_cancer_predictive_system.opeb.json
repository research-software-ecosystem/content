The current study aimed to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival of HCC patients. Methods:The model cohort consisted of 24,991 mRNA expression data points from 348 HCC patients. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to evaluate the prognostic mRNA biomarkers for the overall survival of HCC patients. Results:Using multivariate Cox proportional regression analyses, a prognostic nomogram (named Eight-mRNA prognostic nomogram) was constructed based on the expression data of N4BP3, -ADRA2B, E2F8, MAPT, PZP, HOXD9, COL15A1, and -NDST3.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'Gene Survival Analysis', 'Eight-mRNA', 'Eight-mRNA prognostic'","homepage":"https://zhangzhiqiao2.shinyapps.io/Smart_cancer_predictive_system_HCC_2/","name":"Smart Cancer Predictive System"}}
