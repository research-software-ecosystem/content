Currently, 2585 genes and 212 miRNA have been collected with the experimental evidences involved in the different stages of lung carcinogenesis through text mining. The results from analysis of transcription factor-binding motifs, the promoters and the SNP sites for each gene are also included. Genes with epigenetic regulation were also included.",
