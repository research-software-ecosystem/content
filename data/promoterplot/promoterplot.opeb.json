The input sequence is a TransFac search (public version) or FASTA/Affymetrix IDs (local install). It uses an intuitive pattern recognition algorithm for finding similarities between groups of promoters by dividing transcription factor predictions into conserved triplet models. To minimize the number of false-positive models, it can optionally exclude factors that are known to be unexpressed or inactive in the cells being studied based on microarray or proteomic expression data. The program will also estimate the likelihood of finding a pattern by chance based on the frequency observed in a control set of mammalian promoters we obtained from Genomatix. The results are stored as an interactive SVG web page on our server. © 2005 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Di Cara A.","Schmidt K.","Hemmings B.A.","Oakeley E.J."],"cit_count":5,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15980503","title":"PromoterPlot: A graphical display of promoter similarities by pattern recognition","year":"2005-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:promoterplot","biotoolsID":"promoterplot","description":"Takes the output from a TransFac search as input, and finds similarities between groups of promoters in an attempt to simplify the results of transcription factor searches.
