All rights reserved.Motivation: Multi-label (ML) protein subcellular localization (SCL) is an indispensable way to study protein function. It can locate a certain protein (such as the human transmembrane protein that promotes the invasion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) or expression product at a specific location in a cell, which can provide a reference for clinical treatment of diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results: The article proposes a novel method named ML-locMLFE. First of all, six feature extraction methods are adopted to obtain protein effective information. These methods include pseudo amino acid composition, encoding based on grouped weight, gene ontology, multi-scale continuous and discontinuous, residue probing transformation and evolutionary distance transformation. In the next part, we utilize the ML information latent semantic index method to avoid the interference of redundant information. In the end, ML learning with feature-induced labeling information enrichment is adopted to predict the ML protein SCL. The Gram-positive bacteria dataset is chosen as a training set, while the Gram-negative bacteria dataset, virus dataset, newPlant dataset and SARS-CoV-2 dataset as the test sets. The overall actual accuracy of the first four datasets are 99.23%, 93.82%, 93.24% and 96.72% by the leave-one-out cross validation. It is worth mentioning that the overall actual accuracy prediction result of our predictor on the SARS-CoV-2 dataset is 72.73%. The results indicate that the ML-locMLFE method has obvious advantages in predicting the SCL of ML protein, which provides new ideas for further research on the SCL of ML protein.",
