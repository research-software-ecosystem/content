SPIDER and WEB handle the complementary tasks of batch processing and visualization of the results. The emphasis of the SPIDER system remains in the area of single particle averaging and reconstruction, although a variety of other application areas have been added. Novel features are a suite of operations relating to the determination, modeling, and correction of the contrast transfer function and the availability of the entire documentation in hypertext format.","authors":["Frank J.","Radermacher M.","Penczek P.","Zhu J.","Li Y.","Ladjadj M.","Leith A."],"cit_count":1675,"doi":"10.1006/jsbi.1996.0030","journal":"Journal of Structural Biology","title":"SPIDER and WEB: Processing and visualization of images in 3D electron microscopy and related fields","type":"Primary","year":"1996-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:spider","biotoolsID":"spider","description":"Image processing system for electron microscopy.","homepage":"http://www.wadsworth.org/spider_doc/spider/docs/spider.html","name":"SPIDER","version":["1"]}}
