These associations can be thought of as functions in one dimension and can thus be stored, analyzed, and interpreted as piecewise-polynomial curves. We present a general framework for building piecewise polynomial representations of genome-scale signals and illustrate some of its applications via examples. We show that piecewise constant segmentation, a typical step in copy-number analyses, can be carried out within this framework for both array and (DNA) sequencing data offering advantages over existing methods in each case. Higher-order polynomial curves can be used, for example, to detect trends and/or discontinuities in transcription levels from RNA-seq data. We give a concrete application of piecewise linear functions to diagnose and quantify alignment quality at exon borders (splice sites). Our software (source and object code) for building piecewise polynomial models is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/locsmoc/. \u00a9 2012 Tarabichi et al.", "citationCount": 2, "authors": [{"name": "Tarabichi M."}, {"name": "Detours V."}, {"name": "Konopka T."}], "date": "2012-11-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Vincent Detours", "url": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/locsmoc", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "vdetours@ulb.ac.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:locsmoc", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://sourceforge.net/projects/locsmoc/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid feature detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0415"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Produces piecewise polynomial models for one-dimensional signals of the type encountered in genomics.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Java"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/locsmoc-piecewise-polynomial-curves-for-genomic-signals.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "locsmoc", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:06:41Z", "name": "locsmoc", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://sourceforge.net/projects/locsmoc/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
