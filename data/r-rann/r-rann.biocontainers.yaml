description: Finds the k nearest neighbours for every point in a given dataset in
  O(N log N) time using Arya and Mounts ANN library (v1.1.3). There is support for
  approximate as well as exact searches, fixed radius searches and bd as well as kd
  trees. The distance is computed using the L2 (Euclidean) metric. Please see package
  RANN.L1 for the same functionality using the L1 (Manhattan, taxicab) metric.
