We designed a genome-wide survey program, named \"Ex-DOMAIN\" (exhaustive domain and motif annotator using InterProScan), of protein domains and motifs to aid in the identification and characterization of proteins by using the InterProScan sequence analysis application, which can display information and annotations of targeted proteins and genes, conserved protein domains and motifs, chromosomal locations, and structural diversities of target proteins.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'cucumber'","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31819721","name":"Ex-DOMAIN"}}
