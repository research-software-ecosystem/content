A two step prediction scheme, where a global prediction of the coding potential regulates a cutoff level for a local prediction of splice sites, is refined by rules based on splice site confidence values, prediction scores, coding context and distances between potential splice sites. In this approach, the prediction of splice sites mutually affect each other in a non-local manner. The combined approach drastically reduces the large amount of false positive splice sites normally haunting splice site prediction. An analysis of the errors made by the networks in the first step of the method revealed a previously unknown feature, a frequent T-tract prolongation containing cryptic acceptor sites in the 5' end of exons. The method presented here has been compared with three other approaches, GeneFinder, GeneMark and Grail. Overall the method presented here is an order of magnitude better. We show that the new method is able to find a donor site in the coding sequence for the jelly fish Green Fluorescent Protein, exactly at the position that was experimentally observed in A.thaliana transformants. Predictions for alternatively spliced genes are also presented, together with examples of genes from other dicots, monocots and algae. The method has been made available through electronic mail.", "citationCount": 568, "authors": [{"name": "Hebsgaard S.M."}, {"name": "Korning P.G."}, {"name": "Tolstrup N."}, {"name": "Engelbrecht J."}, {"name": "Rouze P."}, {"name": "Brunak S."}], "date": "1996-09-17T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}, {"doi": null, "note": null, "version": null, "pmid": null, "type": "Other", "pmcid": "PMC146109", "metadata": null}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "CBS", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.bioinformatics.dtu.dk/english/Service/Contact", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:netgene2", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetGene2/", "function": [{"note": "Neural network predictions of splice sites", "input": [{"data": {"term": "Sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2044"}, "format": [{"term": "FASTA", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1929"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Splice site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0433"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein features", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1277"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Sequence report", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2955"}, "format": [{"term": "Binary format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2333"}]}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-11T19:20:29Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Neural network predictions of splice sites in human, C. elegans and A. thaliana DNA.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://cbs.dtu.dk/services", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "netgene2", "additionDate": "2015-06-29T10:15:39Z", "name": "NetGene2", "license": "Other", "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetGene2/instruct.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Emerging", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
