Current variant callers are not suitable for single-cell DNA sequencing, as they do not account for allelic dropout, false-positive errors and coverage nonuniformity. We developed Monovar (https://bitbucket.org/hamimzafar/monovar), a statistical method for detecting and genotyping single-nucleotide variants in single-cell data. Monovar exhibited superior performance over standard algorithms on benchmarks and in identifying driver mutations and delineating clonal substructure in three different human tumor data sets.","authors":["Zafar H.","Wang Y.","Nakhleh L.","Navin N.","Chen K."],"cit_count":24,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3835","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Monovar: Single-nucleotide variant detection in single cells","type":"Primary","year":"2016-06-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:monovar","biotoolsID":"monovar","description":"single nucleotide variant (SNV) detection and genotyping algorithm for single-cell DNA sequencing data.
