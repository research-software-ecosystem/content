Since its initial release, the database has undergone major improvements, and the new version introduces several new features. First, the novel concept of derived models allows users to create model hierarchies that automatically propagate modifications along their order. Second, all stored components can now be easily enhanced with additional annotations that can be directly extracted from a supplied Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) file. Third, the web application has been substantially revised and now features new query mechanisms, an easy search system for reactions and new link-out services to publicly available databases. Fourth, the updated database now contains 20 publicly available models, which can be easily exported into standardized formats for further analysis. Fifth, MEMOSys 2.0 is now also available as a fully configured virtual image and can be found online at http://www.icbi.at/memosys and http://memoys.i-med.ac.at.",
