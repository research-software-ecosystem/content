    "description": "Development of the New Jersey Safety and Health Outcomes (NJ-SHO) data warehouse.\n\nObjective: Our objective is to describe the development of the New Jersey Safety and Health Outcomes (NJ-SHO) data warehouse, a unique and comprehensive data source that integrates various state-level administrative databases in New Jersey to enable the field of traffic safety to address critical, high-priority research questions. Methods: We have obtained full identifiable data from the following statewide administrative databases for the state of New Jersey: (1) driver licensing database; (2) Administration Office of the Courts data on traffic-related citations; (3) police-reported crash database; (4) birth certificate data; (5) death certificate data; and (6) hospital discharge data as well as (7) childhood electronic records from New Jersey residents who were patients of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia pediatric health care network and (8) census tract-level indicators.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!",
