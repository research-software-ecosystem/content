    "description": "Extracting Views into Genome-scale Metabolic Models.\n\nThe GEMtractor a platform for trimming and extracting genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs).\n\nWelcome to the GEMtractor \u2014 a platform for trimming and extracting genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs)!.\n\nFarming with the GEMtractor goes like this:.\n\nUsing the GEMtractor you can trim (currency-)metabolites, reactions, genes, or enzyme complexes off you GEMs, to for example focus on subnetworks as reported by prior flux balance analyses. From the trimmed model you may then extract the Reaction-centric or Enzyme-centric network, wich can be exported in different graph formats for subsequent analyses.\n\nThere is an API, so you may use the GEMtractor from your software tools. The GEMtractor is free software and also available as a Docker image. Thus, running your own GEMtractor is as easy as calling a single command line \u2014 including all the benefits, such as privacy and speed! Read more about the setup at Run your own GEMtractor",
