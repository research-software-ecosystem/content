From the trimmed model you may then extract the Reaction-centric or Enzyme-centric network, wich can be exported in different graph formats for subsequent analyses.\n\nThere is an API, so you may use the GEMtractor from your software tools. The GEMtractor is free software and also available as a Docker image. Thus, running your own GEMtractor is as easy as calling a single command line — including all the benefits, such as privacy and speed!
