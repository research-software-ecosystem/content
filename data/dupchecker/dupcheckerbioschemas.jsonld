      "sc:description": "Meta-analysis has become a popular approach for high-throughput genomic data analysis because it can significantly increase power to detect biological signals or patterns in datasets. However, when using public-available databases for meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often-encountered problem. Not removing duplicates would make study results questionable. We developed a BioConductor package that efficiently identifies duplicated samples by generating MD5 fingerprints for raw data.",
