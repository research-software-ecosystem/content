However, when using public-available databases for meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often-encountered problem. Not removing duplicates would make study results questionable. We developed a BioConductor package that efficiently identifies duplicated samples by generating MD5 fingerprints for raw data.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DupChecker.html","name":"DupChecker","version":["1.12.0"]}}
