description: Meta-analysis has become a popular approach for high-throughput genomic
  data analysis because it often can significantly increase power to detect biological
  signals or patterns in datasets. However, when using public-available databases
  for meta-analysis, duplication of samples is an often encountered problem, especially
  for gene expression data. Not removing duplicates would make study results questionable.
  We developed a Bioconductor package DupChecker that efficiently identifies duplicated
  samples by generating MD5 fingerprints for raw data.
