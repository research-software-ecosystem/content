ZINBA models and accounts for factors that co-vary with background or experimental signal, such as G/C content, and identifies enrichment in genomes with complex local copy number variations. ZINBA provides a single unified framework for analyzing DNA-seq experiments in challenging genomic contexts. © 2011 Rashid et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Rashid N.U.","Giresi P.G.","Ibrahim J.G.","Sun W.","Lieb J.D."],"cit_count":101,"journal":"Genome Biology","pmid":"21787385","title":"ZINBA integrates local covariates with DNA-seq data to identify broad and narrow regions of enrichment, even within amplified genomic regions","year":"2011-07-25"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:zinba","biotoolsID":"zinba","description":"Identifies genomic regions enriched in a variety of ChIP-seq and related next-generation sequencing experiments","homepage":"https://code.google.com/archive/p/zinba/","name":"ZINBA","version":["2.02.03"]}}
