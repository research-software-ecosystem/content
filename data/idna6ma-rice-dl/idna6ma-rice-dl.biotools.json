    "description": "iDNA6mA-Rice-DL is a local web server for identifying DNA N6-methyladenine sites in rice genome by deep learning method. Accurate detection of N6-methyladenine (6mA) sites by biochemical experiments will help to reveal their biological functions, still, these wet experiments are laborious and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a powerful computational model to identify the 6mA sites on a genomic scale, especially for plant genomes. In view of this, we proposed a model called iDNA6mA-Rice-DL for the effective identification of 6mA sites in rice genome, which is an intelligent computing model based on deep learning method. Traditional machine learning methods assume the preparation of the features for analysis. However, our proposed model automatically encodes and extracts key DNA features through an embedded layer and several groups of dense layers.",

Traditional machine learning methods assume the preparation of the features for analysis. However, our proposed model automatically encodes and extracts key DNA features through an embedded layer and several groups of dense layers. We use an independent dataset to evaluate the generalization ability of our model. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) of 0.98 with an accuracy of 95.96% was obtained. The experiment results demonstrate that our model had good performance in predicting 6mA sites in the rice genome. A user-friendly local web server has been established.
