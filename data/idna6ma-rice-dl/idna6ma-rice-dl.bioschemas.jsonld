      "sc:description": "iDNA6mA-Rice-DL is a local web server for identifying DNA N6-methyladenine sites in rice genome by deep learning method. Accurate detection of N6-methyladenine (6mA) sites by biochemical experiments will help to reveal their biological functions, still, these wet experiments are laborious and expensive. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce a powerful computational model to identify the 6mA sites on a genomic scale, especially for plant genomes. In view of this, we proposed a model called iDNA6mA-Rice-DL for the effective identification of 6mA sites in rice genome, which is an intelligent computing model based on deep learning method. Traditional machine learning methods assume the preparation of the features for analysis. However, our proposed model automatically encodes and extracts key DNA features through an embedded layer and several groups of dense layers.",
