There are at least two types of genomic DNA copy number differences: copy number variations (CNVs) and copy number aberrations (CNAs). While CNVs are naturally occurring and inheritable, CNAs are acquired somatic alterations most often observed in tumor tissues only. CNVs tend to be short and more sparsely located in the genome compared with CNAs. GenoCN consists of two components, genoCNV and genoCNA, designed for CNV and CNA studies, respectively. In contrast to most existing methods, genoCN is more flexible in that the model parameters are estimated from the data instead of being decided a priori. GenoCNA also incorporates two important strategies for CNA studies. First, the effects of tissue contamination are explicitly modeled. Second, if SNP arrays are performed for both tumor and normal tissues of one individual, the genotype calls from normal tissue are used to study CNAs in tumor tissue. We evaluated genoCN by applications to 162 HapMap individuals and a brain tumor (glioblastoma) dataset and showed that our method can successfully identify both types of copy number differences and produce high-quality genotype calls. \u00a9 2009 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 78, "authors": [{"name": "Sun W."}, {"name": "Wright F.A."}, {"name": "Tang Z."}, {"name": "Nordgard S.H."}, {"name": "Van Loo P."}, {"name": "Yu T."}, {"name": "Kristensen V.N."}, {"name": "Perou C.M."}], "date": "2009-07-06T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Wei Sun", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "wsun@bios.unc.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:genocn", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["1.26.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/genoCN.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2403"}, {"term": "Genotyping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3196"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Simultaneous identification of copy number states and genotype calls for regions of either copy number variations or copy number aberrations.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool", "Library"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["R", "C"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "genocn", "additionDate": "2017-01-17T15:03:48Z", "name": "genoCN", "license": "GPL-2.0", "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/genoCN.html", "note": null, "type": "User manual"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
