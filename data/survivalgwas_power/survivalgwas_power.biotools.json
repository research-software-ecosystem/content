With the rapid emergence of pharmacogenetic association studies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the complexity of clinical outcomes they consider, there is a need for software to perform power calculations of time to event data over a range of design scenarios and analytical methodologies. Results: We have developed the user friendly software tool SurvivalGWAS_Power to perform power calculations for time to event outcomes over a range of study designs and different analytical approaches. The software calculates the power to detect SNP association with a time to event outcome over a range of study design scenarios. The software enables analyses under a Cox proportional hazards model or Weibull regression model, and can account for treatment and SNP-treatment interaction effects. Simulated data sets can also be generated by SurvivalGWAS_Power to enable analyses with methods that are not currently supported by the power calculator, thereby increasing the flexibility of the software. Conclusions: SurvivalGWAS_Power addresses the need for flexible and user-friendly software for power calculations for genetic association studies of time to event outcomes, with particular design features of relevance in pharmacogenetics.",
