It also identifies clusters of highly coexpressed genes using coexpression network analysis, summarizing the biological information of each module in an eigengene, learning a Bayesian network that models the probabilistic dependencies between modules, and building a decision tree based on the expression of eigengenes.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Pigengene.html","name":"Pigengene","version":["1.0.0"]}}
