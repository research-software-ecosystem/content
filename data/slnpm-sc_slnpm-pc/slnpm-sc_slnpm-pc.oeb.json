        "description": "LncRNA-miRNA interaction prediction through sequence-derived linear neighborhood propagation method with information combination.\n\nBACKGROUND:Researchers discover lncRNAs can act as decoys or sponges to regulate the behavior of miRNAs. Identification of lncRNA-miRNA interactions helps to understand the functions of lncRNAs, especially their roles in complicated diseases. Computational methods can save time and reduce cost in identifying lncRNA-miRNA interactions, but there have been only a few computational methods. RESULTS:In this paper, we propose a sequence-derived linear neighborhood propagation method (SLNPM) to predict lncRNA-miRNA interactions. First, we calculate the integrated lncRNA-lncRNA similarity and the integrated miRNA-miRNA similarity by combining known lncRNA-miRNA interactions, lncRNA sequences and miRNA sequences.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'SLNPM-SC', 'SLNPM-PC'",
