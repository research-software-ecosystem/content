      "sc:description": "The introduction of next generation sequencing approaches has caused a rapid increase in the number of completely sequenced genomes. As one result of this development, it is now feasible to analyze large groups of related genomes in a comparative approach. A main task in comparative genomics is the identification of orthologous genes in different genomes and the classification of genes as core genes or singletons. To support these studies EDGAR - \"Efficient Database framework for comparative Genome Analyses using BLAST score Ratios\" - was developed.",
