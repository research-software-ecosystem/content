                "abstract": "© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Current protein family modeling methods like profile Hidden Markov Model (pHMM), k-mer based methods, and deep learning-based methods do not provide very accurate protein function prediction for proteins in the twilight zone, due to low sequence similarity to reference proteins with known functions. Results: We present a novel method EnsembleFam, aiming at better function prediction for proteins in the twilight zone. EnsembleFam extracts the core characteristics of a protein family using similarity and dissimilarity features calculated from sequence homology relations. EnsembleFam trains three separate Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers for each family using these features, and an ensemble prediction is made to classify novel proteins into these families. Extensive experiments are conducted using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) dataset and G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) dataset. EnsembleFam not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the overall dataset but also provides a much more accurate prediction for twilight zone proteins. Conclusions: EnsembleFam, a machine learning method to model protein families, can be used to better identify members with very low sequence homology. Using EnsembleFam protein functions can be predicted using just sequence information with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods.",
