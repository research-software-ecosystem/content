                "abstract": "GlyNest and CASPER (www.casper.organ.su.se/casper/) are two independent services aiming to predict 1H- and 13C-NMR chemical shifts of glycans. GlyNest estimates chemical shifts of glycans based on a spherical environment encoding scheme for each atom. CASPER is an increment rule-based approach which uses chemical shifts of the free reducing monosaccharides which are altered according to attached residues of an oligo- or polysaccharide sequence. Both services, which are located on separate, distributed, servers are now available through a common interface of the GLYCOSCIENCES.de portal (www.glycosciences.de). The predictive ability of both techniques was evaluated for a test set of 155 13C and 181 1H spectra of assigned glycan structures. The standard deviations between experimental and estimated shifts (1H; 0.081/0.102; 13C 0.763/0.794; GlyNest/CASPER) are comparable for both methods and significantly better than procedures where stereochemistry is not encoded. The predictive ability of both approaches is in most cases sufficiently precise to be used for an automatic assignment of NMR-spectra. Since both procedures work efficiently and require computation times in the millisecond range on standard computers, they are well suited for the assignment of NMR spectra in high-throughput glycomics projects. The service is available at www.glycosciences.de/ sweetdb/start.php?action=form_shift_estimation. \u00a9 2006 The Author(s).",

                "abstract": "Complex carbohydrates are known as mediators of complex cellular events. Concerning their structural diversity, their potential of information content is several orders of magnitude higher in a short sequence than any other biological macromolecule. SWEET-DB (http://www.dkfz.de/spec2/sweetdb/) is an attempt to use modern web techniques to annotate and/or cross-reference carbohydrate-related data collections which allow glycoscientists to find important data for compounds of interest in a compact and well-structured representation. Currently, reference data taken from three data sources can be retrieved for a given carbohydrate (sub)structure. The sources are CarbBank structures and literature references (linked to NCBI PubMed service), NMR data taken from SugaBase and 3D co-ordinates generated with SWEET-II. The main purpose of SWEET-DB is to enable an easy access to all data stored for one carbohydrate structure entering a complete sequence or parts thereof. Access to SWEET-DB contents is provided with the help of separate input spreadsheets for (sub)structures, bibliographic data, general structural data like molecular weight, NMR spectra and biological data. A detailed online tutorial is available at http://www.dkfz.de/spec2/sweetdb/nar/.",

It can now handle a reduced number of experimental signals from an NMR spectrum in the comparison to the simulated spectra of structures that it generates, an improvement which is of practical importance since all signals in NMR spectra cannot always be identified. Furthermore, the program has been enhanced to simulate NMR spectra of multibranched oligo- and polysaccharides. The new developments were tested on four saccharides of known structure but of different complexity and were shown to predict the correct structures.",

The availability of the complete sequence of the human genome has accelerated the systematic identification of so far unidentified glycogenes considerably in many areas of glycobiology using well-established bioinfomatics tools. Although there has been an immense development of new glyco-related data collections as well as informatics tools and several efforts have been started to cross-link and reference the various data deposited in distributed databases, informatics for glycobiology and glycomics is still poorly developed compared to the genomics and proteomics area. The development of algorithms for the automatic interpretation of MS spectra - currently, a severe bottleneck, which hampers the rapid and reliable interpretation of MS data in high-throughput glycomics projects - is reviewed. A comprehensive list of web resources is given. Several lines of progression are discussed. There is an urgent need for the development of decentralised input facilities of experimentally determined glycan structures. Simultaneously, agreements of standards for the structural description of glycans as well as formats for the related data have to be established. The integration of glycomics with genomics/proteomics has to increase. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",
