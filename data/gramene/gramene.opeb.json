Gramene began with the addition of an Ensembl genome browser and has expanded in the last decade to become a robust resource for plant genomics hosting a wide array of data sets including quantitative trait loci (QTL), metabolic pathways, genetic diversity, genes, proteins, germplasm, literature, ontologies and a fully-structured markers and sequences database integrated with genome browsers and maps from various published studies (genetic, physical, bin, etc.). In addition, Gramene now hosts a variety of web services including a Distributed Annotation Server (DAS), BLAST and a public MySQL database. Twice a year, Gramene releases a major build of the database and makes interim releases to correct errors or to make important updates to software and/or data. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Youens-Clark K.","Buckler E.","Casstevens T.","Chen C.","DeClerck G.","Derwent P.","Dharmawardhana P.","Jaiswal P.","Kersey P.","Karthikeyan A.S.","Lu J.","McCouch S.R.","Ren L.","Spooner W.","Stein J.C.","Thomason J.","Wei S.","Ware D."],"cit_count":121,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21076153","title":"Gramene database in 2010: Updates and extensions","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:gramene","biotoolsID":"gramene","description":"This database is a resource for major model and crop plants including Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, maize, sorghum, poplar and grape in addition to several species of rice.
