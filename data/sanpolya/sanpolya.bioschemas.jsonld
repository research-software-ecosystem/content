      "sc:description": "a deep learning method for identifying Poly(A) signals.\n\nPolyadenylation plays a regulatory role in transcription. The recognition of polyadenylation signal (PAS) motif sequence is an important step in polyadenylation. In the past few years, some statistical machine learning-based and deep learning-based methods have been proposed for PAS identification. Although these methods predict PAS with success, there is room for their improvement on PAS identification.",
