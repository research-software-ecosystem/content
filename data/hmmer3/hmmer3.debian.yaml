description: "HMMER is an implementation of profile hidden Markov model methods for\
  \ sensitive searches of biological sequence databases using multiple sequence alignments\
  \ as queries. . Given a multiple sequence alignment as input, HMMER builds a statistical\
  \ model called a \"hidden Markov model\" which can then be used as a query into\
  \ a sequence database to find (and/or align) additional homologues of the sequence\
  \ family.\n"
