In RNASeq this is frequently tested for by checking whether sex-specific genes (e.g. those located on the Y chromosome or the X inactivation gene) are congruent with the sex listed for that sample in the metadata. However, this method cannot be used to detect sample confusion between patients of the same sex, and is less sensitive when the phenotype skews the sex ratio of samples away from 1:1.\n\nHere we present a tool that leverages RNASeq reads to call genomic SNPs, and use that to generate a similarity matrix between all samples to detect sample confusion.\n\ngit clone https://github.com/nicokist/RNASeq_similarity_matrix",
