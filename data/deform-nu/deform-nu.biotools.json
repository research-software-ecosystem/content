DNA-based processes are regulated via nucleosomes. Therefore, it is significant to determine nucleosome positions in DNA-based processes. A deformation energy model was proposed to predict nucleosome positions in our previous study. A free web server based on the model (http://lin-group.cn/server/deform-nu/) was firstly established to estimate the occupancy and rotational positioning of nucleosomes in the study. Then, the performance of the model was verified by several examples. The results indicated that nucleosome positioning relied on the physical properties of DNA, such as deformation energy.",
