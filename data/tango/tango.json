    "description": "A computer algorithm for prediction of aggregating regions in unfolded polypeptide chains. The model used here, is designed to predict cross-beta aggregation in peptides and denatured proteins and consists of a phase-space encompassing the random coil and 4 possible structural states: beta-turn, alpha-helix, beta-sheet aggregation and alpha-helical aggregation.",

                "abstract": "We have developed a statistical mechanics algorithm, TANGO, to predict protein aggregation. TANGO is based on the physico-chemical principles of \u03b2-sheet formation, extended by the assumption that the core regions of an aggregate are fully buried. Our algorithm accurately predicts the aggregation of a data set of 179 peptides compiled from the literature as well as of a new set of 71 peptides derived from human disease-related proteins, including prion protein, lysozyme and \u03b22-microglobulin. TANGO also correctly predicts pathogenic as well as protective mutations of the Alzheimer \u03b2-peptide, human lysozyme and transthyretin, and discriminates between \u03b2-sheet propensity and aggregation. Our results confirm the model of intermolecular \u03b2-sheet formation as a widespread underlying mechanism of protein aggregation. Furthermore, the algorithm opens the door to a fully automated, sequence-based design strategy to improve the aggregation properties of proteins of scientific or industrial interest.",
