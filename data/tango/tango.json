TANGO is based on the physico-chemical principles of \u03b2-sheet formation, extended by the assumption that the core regions of an aggregate are fully buried. Our algorithm accurately predicts the aggregation of a data set of 179 peptides compiled from the literature as well as of a new set of 71 peptides derived from human disease-related proteins, including prion protein, lysozyme and \u03b22-microglobulin. TANGO also correctly predicts pathogenic as well as protective mutations of the Alzheimer \u03b2-peptide, human lysozyme and transthyretin, and discriminates between \u03b2-sheet propensity and aggregation. Our results confirm the model of intermolecular \u03b2-sheet formation as a widespread underlying mechanism of protein aggregation. Furthermore, the algorithm opens the door to a fully automated, sequence-based design strategy to improve the aggregation properties of proteins of scientific or industrial interest.", "citationCount": 865, "authors": [{"name": "Fernandez-Escamilla A.-M."}, {"name": "Rousseau F."}, {"name": "Schymkowitz J."}, {"name": "Serrano L."}], "date": "2004-10-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nature Biotechnology"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://tango.crg.es/support.jsp", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:tango", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://tango.crg.es/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}, {"term": "Protein structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0474"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A computer algorithm for prediction of aggregating regions in unfolded polypeptide chains.
