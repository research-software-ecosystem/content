Pro-Maya's algorithm combines a newly developed collaborative-filtering-based algorithm (CF), Random Forests regression and a diverse set of descriptors.Our algorithm was extensively benchmarked using cross-validation on two previously utilized datasets of single amino acid mutations and a validation set. The results manifest that using known ??G values for mutations at the query position improves the ??G prediction of other mutations in the position. Our predictions in such cases surpass similar methods significantly, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.79, and a root mean square error of 0.96 on the validation set. Because o",

                "abstract": "Motivation: Accurate prediction of protein stability is important for understanding the molecular underpinnings of diseases and for the design of new proteins. We introduce a novel approach for the prediction of changes in protein stability that arise from a single-site amino acid substitution; the approach uses available data on mutations occurring in the same position and in other positions. Our algorithm, named Pro-Maya (Protein Mutant stAbilitY Analyzer), combines a collaborative filtering baseline model, Random Forests regression and a diverse set of features. Pro-Maya predicts the stability free energy difference of mutant versus wild type, denoted as \u0394\u0394G. Results: We evaluated our algorithm extensively using cross-validation on two previously utilized datasets of single amino acid mutations and a (third) validation set. The results indicate that using known \u0394\u0394G values of mutations at the query position improves the accuracy of \u0394\u0394G predictions for other mutations in that position. The accuracy of our predictions in such cases significantly surpasses that of similar methods, achieving, e.g. a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a root mean square error of 0.96 on the validation set. Because Pro-Maya uses a diverse set of features, including predictions using two other methods, it also performs slightly better than other methods in the absence of additional experimental data on the query positions. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011.
