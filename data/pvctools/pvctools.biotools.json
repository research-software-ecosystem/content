    "description": "parallel variation calling tools.\n\nPVCTools is Parallel Variation Calling Tools, which tries to call variation using multiple threads. Basically, the reference genome will be splited into small pieces, and corresponding alignment BAM files will be extracted. Under this way, it will speed up the process of variation calling a lot",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019As the development of sequencing technology, it is now possible to sequence individuals of each species. Although a number of different tools have been developed to detect individual variations, most of them cannot be run in parallel modes. To accelerate variation detection, PVCTools is introduced in this study. PVCTools splits the reference genome and alignment files into small pieces and runs them in parallel mode. Meanwhile, boundary noise is also considered in PVCTools. From the result of three different sets of test data, PVCTools performs much faster than most other current tools. At the same time, it keeps similar accuracy with other tools. PVCTools is free and open source software. The development of sequencing technology and growing sample numbers will make performance improvements such as PVCTools increasingly interesting.",
