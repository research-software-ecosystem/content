Compared to the current typical paradigm, read mapping incorporating existing variants can improve the performance of subsequent analysis. This method is supposed to map sequencing reads efficiently to a graphical index with a reference genome and known variation to increase alignment quality and variant calling accuracy. However, storing and indexing various types of variation require costly RAM space. Methods: Aligning reads to a graph model-based index including the whole set of variants is ultimately an NP-hard problem in theory. Here, we propose a variation-aware read alignment algorithm (VARA), which generates the alignment between read and multiple genomic sequences simultaneously utilizing the schema of the Landau-Vishkin algorithm. VARA dynamically extracts regional variants to construct a pseudo tree-based structure on-the-fly for seed extension without loading the whole genome variation into memory space. Results: We developed the novel high-throughput sequencing read aligner deBGA-VARA by integrating VARA into deBGA. The deBGA-VARA is benchmarked both on simulated reads and the NA12878 sequencing dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that read alignment incorporating genetic variation knowledge can achieve high sensitivity and accuracy. Conclusions: Due to its efficiency, VARA provides a promising solution for further improvement of variant calling while maintaining small memory footprints. The deBGA-VARA is available at: https://github.com/hitbc/deBGA-VARA.",
