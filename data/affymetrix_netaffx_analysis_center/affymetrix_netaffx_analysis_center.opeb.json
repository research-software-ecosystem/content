These annotations include (i) static information specific to the probeset composition; (ii) sequence annotations extracted from public databases; and (iii) protein sequence-level annotations derived from public domain programs, as well as libraries of hidden Markov models (HMMs) developed at Affymetrix. For each probeset, NetAffx lists the probe sequences, and the consensus sequence interrogated by the probes; for the larger chip sets, interactive maps display this sequence data in genomic context. Sequence annotations include Gene Ontology (GO) terms and depiction of GO graph relationships; predicted protein domains and motifs; orthologous sequences; links to relevant pathways; and links to public databases including UniGene, LocusLink, SWISS-PROT and OMIM.","authors":["Liu G.","Loraine A.E.","Shigeta R.","Cline M.","Cheng J.","Valmeekam V.","Sun S.","Kulp D.","Siani-Rose M.A."],"cit_count":407,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"12519953","title":"NetAffix: Affymetrix probesets and annotations","year":"2003-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:affymetrix_netaffx_analysis_center","biotoolsID":"affymetrix_netaffx_analysis_center","description":"Allows correlation of GeneChip array results with array design and annotation information; provides access to array content information, including probe sequences and gene annotations; free registration is required.","homepage":"http://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/index.affx","name":"Affymetrix NetAffx Analysis Center"}}
