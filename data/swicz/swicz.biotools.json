                "abstract": "Here we present the Swiss-Czech Proteomics Server (SWICZ), which hosts the proteomic database summarizing information about the cell cycle of the aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. The database provides a searchable tool for easy access of global protein synthesis and protein stability data as examined during the C. crescentus cell cycle. Protein synthesis data collected from five different cell cycle stages were determined for each protein spot as a relative value of the total amount of [35S]methionine incorporation. Protein stability of pulse-labeled extracts were measured during a chase period equivalent to one cell cycle unit. Quantitative information for individual proteins together with descriptive data such as protein identities, apparent molecular masses and isoelectric points, were combined with information on protein function, genomic context, and the cell cycle stage, and were then assembled in a relational data-base with a world wide web interface (http://proteom.biomed.cas.cz), which allows the database records to be searched and displays the recovered information. A total of 1250 protein spots were reproducibly detected on two-dimensional gel electropherograms, 295 of which were identified by mass spectroscopy. The database is accessible either through clickable two-dimensional gel electrophoretic maps or by means of a set of dedicated search engines. Basic characterization of the experimental procedures, data processing, and a comprehensive description of the web site are presented. In its current state, the SWICZ proteome database provides a platform for the incorporation of new data emerging from extended functional studies on the C. crescentus proteome.",

Here we analyze proteosynthetic profiles in a bacterium undergoing defined metabolic changes. Streptomyces coelicolor cultured in a defined liquid medium displays four distinct patterns of gene expression associated with growth on glutamate, diauxic transition, and growth on maltose and ammonia that terminates by starvation for nitrogen and entry into stationary phase. Principal component and fuzzy duster analyses of the proteome database of 935 protein spot profiles revealed principal kinetic patterns. Online linkage of the proteome database (SWICZ) to a protein-function database (KEGG) revealed limited correlations between expression profiles and metabolic pathway activities. Proteins belonging to principal metabolic pathways defined characteristic kinetic profiles correlated with the physiological state of the culture. These analyses supported the concept that metabolic flux was regulated not by individual enzymes but rather by groups of enzymes whose synthesis responded to changes in nutritional conditions. Higher-level regulation is reflected by the distribution of all kinetic profiles into only nine groups. The observation that enzymes representing principal metabolic pathways displayed their own distinctive average kinetic profiles suggested that expression of a \"high-flux backbone\" may dominate regulation of metabolic flux. \u00a9 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
