    "description": "an R package for risk assessment of travel-related spread of disease | \u2623\u2708\ufe0f Risk assessment of travel-related disease spread | Predicting Disease Spread from Flow Data | Welcome to the epiflows package! | epiflows is a package for predicting and visualising spread of infectious diseases based on flows between geographical locations, e.g., countries. epiflows provides functions for calculating spread estimates, handling flow data, and visualization | Provides functions and classes designed to handle and visualise epidemiological flows between locations. Also contains a statistical method for predicting disease spread from flow data initially described in Dorigatti et al. (2017) <doi:10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2017.22.28.30572>. This package is part of the RECON (<http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/>) toolkit for outbreak analysis",
