Specifically, Meta-BASIC compares sequence profiles combined with predicted secondary structure by utilizing several scoring systems and alignment algorithms. In our benchmarking tests, Meta-BASIC outperforms many individual servers, including fold recognition servers, and it can compete with meta predictors that base their strength on the structural comparison of models. In addition, Meta-BASIC, which enables detection of very distant relationships even if the tertiary structure for the reference protein is not known, has a high-throughput capability. This new method is applied to 860 PfamA protein families with unknown function (DUF) and provides many novel structure-functional assignments available on-line at http://basic.bioinfo.pl/duf.pl. Detailed discussion is provided for two of the most interesting assignments. DUF271 and DUF431 are predicted to be a nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase and an \u03b1/\u03b2-knot SAM-dependent RNA methyltransferase, respectively. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.", "citationCount": 96, "authors": [{"name": "Ginalski K."}, {"name": "von Grotthuss M."}, {"name": "Grishin N.V."}, {"name": "Rychlewski L."}], "date": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Leszek Rychlewski", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "leszek@bioinfo.pl"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Krzysztof Ginalski", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "kginal@bioinfo.pl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:meta-basic", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://basic.bioinfo.pl/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein secondary structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2488"}, {"term": "Protein structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2487"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0267"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2416"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A tool for detecting distant homologues using meta-profiles which combine both sequence positional variability and secondary structure.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "meta-basic", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T11:35:52Z", "name": "Meta-BASIC", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
