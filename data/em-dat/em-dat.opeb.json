This field is automatically linked to the disaster sub-group and the disaster type. There is a third group ‘Complex disasters’ which include some major famine situation for which the drought were not the main causal factor. See Table 1 for the Disasters Classification.\n\nWeek 50-2019: December 09 - December 15.\n\nIn 1988, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) launched the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'temperature-related disasters Europe', 'temperature-related casualties'",
