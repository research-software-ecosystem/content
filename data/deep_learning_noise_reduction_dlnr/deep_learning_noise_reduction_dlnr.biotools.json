    "description": "A fully convolutional (with no pooling layers) model was trained on a set of noisy images with the ground truth being the original image without the (synthetic) noise. Different levels of noise and types were incorporated into the training set. The experiments showed reduction in noise levels, but it can impact image quality when T2ws without noise is provided to the model.",
