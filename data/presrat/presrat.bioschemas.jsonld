      "sc:description": "A server for identification of bacterial small-RNA sequences and their targets with probable binding region.\n\nPredicting small RNAs and their Targets.\n\nHere, we present a webserver, PresRAT which aims to identify novel sRNA and its target genes.\n\nPresRAT aims to predict potential bacterial sRNA and the potential target of that sRNA against a bacterial genome containing mRNA sequences. With an added advantage PresRAT can build and perform molecular dynamics simulation on 3D models these sRNA and sRNA-mRNA bound duplex regions.\n\nBacterial small-RNAs (sRNA) are RNAs of varied length (40 to 500 nucleotide long) mostly encoded in the intergenic regions of bacterial chromosomes. Most sRNAs act as regulatory elements by base pairing with the 5' untranslated region of mRNA transcripts.These sRNAs play important roles in gene regulation by modifying the stability and expression of the target transcript.",
