It does this by partitioning individual chains into multiple segments that are modeled as rigid bodies undergoing TLS (Translation/Libration/Screw) vibrational motion. It generates all possible partitions up to a maximum number of segments.","homepage":"http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/~tlsmd/index.html","name":"TLS Motion Determination"}}
