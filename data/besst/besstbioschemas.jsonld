  "sc:description": "This tool is a scaffolder. The input is a contig file and a set of BAM files from mapping paired-ends and/or mate-pair reads to the contigs, and the output are scaffolds, i.e., the contigs linked and oriented. It is both fast and accurate. Careful estimation of the gaps between contigs, many other scaffolders have seriously biased estimation. Novel treatment of paired-end contamination in mate-pair libraries, which identifies that some links in the MP data are better treated as PE.",
