In this paper, we propose an effective computational model that uses deep learning and word2vec to predict therapeutic peptides (PTPD). *: Results Representation vectors of all k-mers were obtained through word2vec based on k-mer co-existence information. The original peptide sequences were then divided into k-mers using the windowing method. The peptide sequences were mapped to the input layer by the embedding vector obtained by word2vec. Three types of filters in the convolutional layers, as well as dropout and max-pooling operations, were applied to construct feature maps",
