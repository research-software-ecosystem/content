    "description": "ASAFind is a software that predicts the intracellular location of proteins in cells with four membrane-bound complex plastids of red algal origin. \nThese plastids evolved via eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis and for example can be found in diatoms and cryptophytes. The plastids in these groups of algae are not only surrounded by additional membranes compared to primary plastids (as found in red-, green- and glaucophyte algae), but also by an additional compartment between the second and third membrane, which is referred to as the periplastidic compartment. The N-terminal part of the pre-protein of nucleus-encoded diatom plastid proteins is an ER-type signal peptide, which is followed by a transit peptide, and the cleavage site between these two targeting domains is characterized by a characteristic sequence motif (\u201cASA-FAP\u201d), such targeting pre-sequences are commonly referred to as bipartite targeting signals.",
