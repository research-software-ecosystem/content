description: Circular layout is an efficient way for the visualization of huge  amounts
  of information. Here the circlize package provides an implementation  of circular
  layout generation in R as well as an enhancement of available  software. The flexibility
  of this package is based on the usage of low-level  graphics functions such that
  self-defined high-level graphics can be easily  implemented by users for specific
  purposes. Together with the seamless  connection between the powerful computational
  and visual environment in R,  circlize gives users more convenience and freedom
  to design figures for  better understanding complex patterns behind multi-dimensional
  data.
