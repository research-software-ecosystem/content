about:
  description: DriverNet is a package to predict functional important driver genes
    in cancer by integrating genome data (mutation and copy number variation data)
    and transcriptome data (gene expression data). The different kinds of data are
    combined by an influence graph, which is a gene-gene interaction network deduced
    from pathway data. A greedy algorithm is used to find the possible driver genes,
    which may mutated in a larger number of patients and these mutations will push
    the gene expression values of the connected genes to some extreme values.
