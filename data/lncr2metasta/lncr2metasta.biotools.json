For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Mounting evidence has shown the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) during various cancer metastatic events (abbreviated as CMEs, e.g. cancer cell invasion, intravasation, extravasation, proliferation, etc.) that may cooperatively facilitate malignant tumor spread and cause massive patient deaths. The study of lncRNA-CME associations might help understand lncRNA functions in metastasis and present reliable biomarkers for early dissemination detection and optimized treatment. Therefore, we developed a database named 'lncR2metasta' by manually compiling experimentally supported lncRNAs during various CMEs from existing studies. LncR2metasta documents 1238 associations between 304 lncRNAs and 39 CMEs across 54 human cancer subtypes. Each entry of lncR2metasta contains detailed information on a lncRNA-CME association, including lncRNA symbol, a specific CME, brief description of the association, lncRNA category, lncRNA Entrez or Ensembl ID, lncRNA genomic location and strand, lncRNA experiment, lncRNA expression pattern, detection method, target gene (or pathway) of lncRNA, lncRNA regulatory role on a CME, cancer name and the literature reference. An easy-to-use web interface was deployed in lncR2metasta for its users to easily browse, search and download as well as to submit novel lncRNA-CME associations. LncR2metasta will be a useful resource in cancer research community. It is freely available at http://lncR2metasta.wchoda.com.",
