Xaperones.com identifies Xaperones that stabilize unique therapeutic conformations of your targets In 1993, scientists at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel discovered the occurence of bona fide antibodies devoid of light chains in Camelidae. The small and rigid recombinant antigen binding fragments (15kD) of these heavy chain only antibodies - known as VHHs or NanobodiesTM - proved to be unique research tools in structural biology.By rigidifying flexible regions and obscuring aggregative surfaces, XaperoneTM complexes warrant conformationally uniform samples that are key to protein structure determination by X-ray crystallography. The elucidation of the first GPCR structure in its active state using conformationally selective Xaperones1 demonstrates the power of the Xaperone platform to speed up and reduce the cost of generating diffracting quality crystals of challenging targets.
