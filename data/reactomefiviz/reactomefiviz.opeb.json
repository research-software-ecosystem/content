It uses highly reliable gene functional interaction network combined with human curated pathways derived from Reactome and other pathway databases. BiIt allows to uncover network and pathway patterns, search for gene signatures from gene expression data sets, reveal pathways significantly enriched by genes in a list, and integrate multiple genomic data types into a pathway context using probabilistic graphical models.","homepage":"http://wiki.reactome.org/index.php/Reactome_FI_Cytoscape_Plugin","name":"ReactomeFIViz","version":["7.1.0"]}}
