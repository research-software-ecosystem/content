Circular RNAs (circRNAs) is class of non-coding RNA generated in a “back-splicing”. Recent studies have highlighted the important role of circRNAs in cancer. Here, we systematically characterize circRNAs expression profile in 935 cancer cell lines across 22 cancer lineages from Cancer Cell line Encyclopedia (CCLE), and analyzed the circRNAs biogenesis regulators, effect of circRNAs on drug response and association between circRNAs with mRNA, protein and mutation, and predicted RNA regulatory element in circRNAs","homepage":"https://hanlab.uth.edu/cRic","name":"CircRiC"}}
