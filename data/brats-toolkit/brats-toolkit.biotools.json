Several factors impede successful implementations, including data standardization and preprocessing. However, these steps are pivotal for the deployment of state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms. To overcome these issues, we present BraTS Toolkit. BraTS Toolkit is a holistic approach to brain tumor segmentation and consists of three components: First, the BraTS Preprocessor facilitates data standardization and preprocessing for researchers and clinicians alike. It covers the entire image analysis workflow prior to tumor segmentation, from image conversion and registration to brain extraction. Second, BraTS Segmentor enables orchestration of BraTS brain tumor segmentation algorithms for generation of fully-automated segmentations. Finally, Brats Fusionator can combine the resulting candidate segmentations into consensus segmentations using fusion methods such as majority voting and iterative SIMPLE fusion. The capabilities of our tools are illustrated with a practical example to enable easy translation to clinical and scientific practice.",
