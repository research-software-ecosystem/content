description: A supra-hexagonal map is a giant hexagon on a 2-dimensional grid seamlessly
  consisting of smaller hexagons. It is supposed to train, analyse and visualise a
  high-dimensional omics input data. The supraHex is able to carry out gene clustering/meta-clustering
  and sample correlation, plus intuitive visualisations to facilitate exploratory
  analysis. More importantly, it allows for overlaying additional data onto the trained
  map to explore relations between input and additional data. So with supraHex, it
  is also possible to carry out multilayer omics data comparisons. Newly added utilities
  are advanced heatmap visualisation and tree-based analysis of sample relationships.
  Uniquely to this package, users can ultrafastly understand any tabular omics data,
  both scientifically and artistically, especially in a sample-specific fashion but
  without loss of information on large genes.
