                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed as one of the major drug targets for COVID-19. We have identified the experimental data on the inhibitory activity of compounds tested against the closely related (96 % sequence identity, 100 % active site conservation) Mpro of SARS-CoV. We developed QSAR models of these inhibitors and employed these models for virtual screening of all drugs in the DrugBank database. Similarity searching and molecular docking were explored in parallel, but docking failed to correctly discriminate between experimentally active and inactive compounds, so it was not relied upon for prospective virtual screening. Forty-two compounds were identified by our models as consensus computational hits. Subsequent to our computational studies, NCATS reported the results of experimental screening of their drug collection in SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/). Coincidentally, NCATS tested 11 of our 42 hits, and three of them, cenicriviroc (AC50 of 8.9 \u03bcM), proglumetacin (tested twice independently, with AC50 of 8.9 \u03bcM and 12.5 \u03bcM), and sufugolix (AC50 12.6 \u03bcM), were shown to be active. These observations support the value of our modeling approaches and models for guiding the experimental investigations of putative anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. All data and models used in this study are publicly available via Supplementary Materials, GitHub (https://github.com/alvesvm/sars-cov-mpro), and Chembench web portal (https://chembench.mml.unc.edu/).",

Chembench is one of the first publicly accessible, integrated cheminformatics Web portals. It has been extensively used by researchers from different fields for curation, visualization, analysis, and modeling of chemogenomics data. Since its launch in 2008, Chembench has been accessed more than 1 million times by more than 5000 users from a total of 98 countries. We report on the recent updates and improvements that increase the simplicity of use, computational efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of a broad range of tools and services for computer-assisted drug design and computational toxicology available on Chembench. Chembench remains freely accessible at https://chembench.mml.unc.edu.",
