description: metaCCA performs multivariate analysis of a single or multiple GWAS based
  on univariate regression coefficients. It allows multivariate representation of
  both phenotype and genotype. metaCCA extends the statistical technique of canonical
  correlation analysis to the setting where original individual-level records are
  not available, and employs a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness.
