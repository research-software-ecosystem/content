      "sc:description": "TailTimer: Automating the tail immersion assay. An open-source device for automating the rodent tail immersion assay.\n\nThe tail immersion assay is a widely used method for measuring acute thermal pain in rodents. TailTimer uses the Raspberry Pi computer to automatically record both tail withdrawal latency and water temperature. The device has a radio frequency identification (RFID) system that can record the ID of animals. The software recognizes several specific RFID keys as user interface commands, which allows TailTimer to be operated via RFID fobs. We also programmed the device to only allow tests to be conducted when the water is within ± 0.25 °C of the target temperature.",
