DIFFERENT) bio.tools/p53 (p53) | Portable Progressive Parallel Processing Pipelines for Interactive Data Analysis and Visualization | We present P5, a web-based visualization toolkit that combines declarative visualization grammar and GPU computing for progressive data analysis and visualization. To interactively analyze and explore big data, progressive analytics and visualization methods have recently emerged. Progressive visualizations of incrementally refining results have the advantages of allowing users to steer the analysis process and make early decisions. P5 leverages declarative grammar for specifying visualization designs and exploits GPU computing to accelerate progressive data processing and rendering. The declarative specifications can be modified during progressive processing to create different visualizations for analyzing the intermediate results","homepage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=31442985","name":"P5"}}
