    "description": "BoostDM is a method to score all possible point mutations (single base substitutions) in cancer genes for their potential to be involved in tumorigenesis. The method is based on the analysis of observed mutations in sequenced tumors and their site-by-site annotation with relevant features. The compendium of cancer genes and the mutational features for each cancer gene across malignancies have been derived from the systematic analysis of tens of thousands of tumor samples (www.intogen.org). Other relevant features have been collected from public databases.",
