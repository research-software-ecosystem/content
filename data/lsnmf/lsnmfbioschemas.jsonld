  "sc:description": "LSNMF (Least Squared Non-negative Matrix Factorization) is a modified version of NMF (non-negative matrix factorization), it focus on gene expression patterns analysis on microarray datasets. The major improvement of LSNMF algorithm over NMF is that it incorporate uncertainty estimates into the update rules, so it is much more stable over the possible noise in the datasets, and it also more sensitive to the real signals.",
