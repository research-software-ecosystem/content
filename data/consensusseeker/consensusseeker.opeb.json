Recent next generation CHIP-chip and CHIP-Seq technologies have accelerated our understanding of basic principles of chromatin organization. These technologies have taught us that nucleosomes play a crucial role in gene regulation by allowing physical access to transcription factors. Recent methods and experimental advancements allow the determination of nucleosome positions for a given genome area. However, most of these methods estimate the number of nucleosomes either by an EM algorithm using a BIC criterion or an effective heuristic strategy. Here, we introduce a Bayesian method for identifying nucleosome positions. The proposed model is based on a Multinomial-Dirichlet classification and a hierarchical mixture distributions. The number and the positions of nucleosomes are estimated using a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation technique. We compare the performance of our method on simulated data and MNase-Seq data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae against PING and NOrMAL methods.","authors":["Samb R.","Khadraoui K.","Belleau P.","Deschenes A.","Lakhal-Chaieb L.","Droit A."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1515/sagmb-2014-0098","journal":"Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology","title":"Using informative Multinomial-Dirichlet prior in a t-mixture with reversible jump estimation of nucleosome positions for genome-wide profiling","type":"Primary","year":"2015-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:consensusseeker","biotoolsID":"consensusseeker","description":"This package compares genomic positions and genomic ranges from multiple experiments to extract common regions.
