In the identification process the experimental peptide masses are compared with the peptide masses stored in the database both with and without possible post-translational modifications. This intermediate identification step is fast and singles out peptides that are potential endogenous peptides and can later be confirmed with tandem mass spectrometry data. Successful applications of this methodology are presented. The SwePep database is a relational database developed using MySql and Java. The database contains 4180 annotated endogenous peptides from different tissues originating from 394 different species as well as 50 novel peptides from brain tissue identified in our laboratory. Information about the peptides, including mass, isoelectric point, sequence, and precursor protein, is also stored in the database. This new approach holds great potential for removing the bottleneck that occurs during the identification process in the field of peptidomics. The SwePep database is available to the public. \u00a92006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", "citationCount": 95, "authors": [{"name": "Falth M."}, {"name": "Skold K."}, {"name": "Norrman M."}, {"name": "Svensson M."}, {"name": "Fenyo D."}, {"name": "Andren P.E."}], "date": "2006-06-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Molecular and Cellular Proteomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Provider"], "name": "bils.se", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Institute", "email": null}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "per.andren@bmms.uu.se"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:swepep", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.swepep.se/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "Peptide ID", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2906"}, "format": []}], "operation": [{"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Peptide property", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2979"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An endogenous peptide database.", "toolType": ["Database portal"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "swepep", "additionDate": "2015-12-06T15:18:34Z", "name": "SwePep", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.swepep.se/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
