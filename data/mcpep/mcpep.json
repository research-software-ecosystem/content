The server can explore the interaction of helical peptides of any amino-acid composition with membranes of various lipid compositions. Given the peptide's sequence or structure and the natural width and surface charge of the membrane, MCPep reports the main determinants of peptide-membrane interactions, e.g. average location and orientation in the membrane, free energy of membrane association and the peptide's helical content.
