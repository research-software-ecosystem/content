      "sc:description": "next generation access point for perturbation-response signatures.\n\nThe Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) is an NIH Common Fund program with the goal of generating a large-scale and comprehensive catalogue of perturbation-response signatures by utilizing a diverse collection of perturbations across many model systems and assay types. The LINCS Data Portal (LDP) has been the primary access point for the compendium of LINCS data and has been widely utilized. Here, we report the first major update of LDP (http: lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu signatures) with substantial changes in the data architecture and APIs, a completely redesigned user interface, and enhanced curated metadata annotations to support more advanced, intuitive and deeper querying, exploration and analysis capabilities.",
