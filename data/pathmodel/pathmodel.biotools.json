Therefore, specific bioinformatic tools are necessary to infer biochemical reactions and metabolic structures that can be checked experimentally. Using an integrative approach combining genomic and metabolomic data in the red algal model Chondrus crispus, we show that, even metabolic pathways considered as conserved, like sterols or mycosporine-like amino acid synthesis pathways, undergo substantial turnover. This phenomenon, here formally defined as \u201cmetabolic pathway drift,\u201d is consistent with findings from other areas of evolutionary biology, indicating that a given phenotype can be conserved even if the underlying molecular mechanisms are changing. We present a proof of concept with a methodological approach to formalize the logical reasoning necessary to infer reactions and molecular structures, abstracting molecular transformations based on previous biochemical knowledge. \u00a9 2020 The Author(s)Bioinformatics; Genomics; Metabolomics",
