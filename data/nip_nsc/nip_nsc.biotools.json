The software has shows demonstrated performance in discriminating biological interfaces from non-biological one. The time efficient performance of the software allows the integration in the large scale screening of protein-protein contacts.",

We have developed two new and conceptually different measures using the Delaunay tessellation and interface slice selection to compute the surface complementarity and atom packing at the protein-protein interface in a straightforward manner. Our measures show a strong correlation among themselves and with other existing measures, and can be calculated in a highly time-efficient manner. The measures are discriminative for evaluating biological, as well as non-biological protein-protein contacts, especially from large protein complexes and large-scale structural studies (http://pallab.serc.iisc.ernet.in/nip_nsc). © 2010 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.",
