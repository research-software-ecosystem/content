Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Transmembrane proteins (TMPs) are crucial in the life of the cells. As they have special properties, their structure is hard to determine––the PDB database consists of 2% TMPs, despite the fact that they are predicted to make up to 25% of the human proteome. Crystallization prediction methods were developed to aid the target selection for structure determination, however, there is a need for a TMP specific service. Results: Here, we present TMCrys, a crystallization prediction method that surpasses existing prediction methods in performance thanks to its specialization for TMPs. We expect TMCrys to improve target selection of TMPs.","authors":["Varga J.K.","Tusnady G.E."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bty342","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"TMCrys: Predict propensity of success for transmembrane protein crystallization","year":"2018-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:tmcrys","biotoolsID":"tmcrys","description":"Predict propensity of success for transmembrane protein crystallization.","homepage":"https://github.com/brgenzim/tmcrys","name":"TMCrys"}}
