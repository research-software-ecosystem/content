Although some existing computational methods for identifying genetic interactions have been effective for small-scale studies, we here propose a method, denoted 'bayesian epistasis association mapping' (BEAM), for genome-wide case-control studies. BEAM treats the disease-associated markers and their interactions via a bayesian partitioning model and computes, via Markov chain Monte Carlo, the posterior probability that each marker set is associated with the disease. Testing this on an age-related macular degeneration genome-wide association data set, we demonstrate that the method is significantly more powerful than existing approaches and that genome-wide case-control epistasis mapping with many thousands of markers is both computationally and statistically feasible. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.","authors":["Zhang Y.","Liu J.S."],"cit_count":292,"doi":"10.1038/ng2110","journal":"Nature Genetics","title":"Bayesian inference of epistatic interactions in case-control studies","type":"Primary","year":"2007-09-01"},{"abstract":"© The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","authors":["Afgan E.","Baker D.","van den Beek M.","Blankenberg D.","Bouvier D.","Cech M.","Chilton J.","Clements D.","Coraor N.","Eberhard C.","Gruning B.","Guerler A.","Hillman-Jackson J.","Von Kuster G.","Rasche E.","Soranzo N.","Turaga N.","Taylor J.","Nekrutenko A.","Goecks J."],"cit_count":523,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkw343","journal":"Nucleic acids research","title":"The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update","type":"Other","year":"2016-07-08"},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","type":"Other"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:hgv_beam-ip","biotoolsID":"hgv_beam","description":"The tool detects significant single- and multi-locus SNP associations in case-control studies.","homepage":"https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/tree/dev/tools","name":"hgv_beam","version":["1.0.0"]}}
