Example applications include transcript-level RNA-Seq quantification, allele-specific/haplotype expression analysis (from RNA-Seq), transcription factor binding quantification in ChIP-Seq, and analysis of metagenomic data. It can be used to resolve ambiguous mappings in other high-throughput sequencing based applications.",
