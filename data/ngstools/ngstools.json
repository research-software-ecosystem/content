Genotypes and/or single-nucleotide polymorphisms are then determined from the read composition at each site, which become the basis for many downstream analyses. However, for low sequencing depths, e.g., there is considerable statistical uncertainty in the assignment of genotypes because of random sampling of homologous base pairs in heterozygotes and sequencing or alignment errors. Recently, several probabilistic methods have been proposed to account for this uncertainty and make accurate inferences from low quality and/or coverage sequencing data. We present ngsTools, a collection of programs to perform population genetics analyses from next-generation sequencing data. The methods implemented in these programs do not rely on single-nucleotide polymorphism or genotype calling and are particularly suitable for low sequencing depth data. \u00a9 The Author 2014.", "citationCount": 73, "authors": [{"name": "Fumagalli M."}, {"name": "Vieira F.G."}, {"name": "Linderoth T."}, {"name": "Nielsen R."}], "date": "2014-05-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Matteo Fumagalli", "url": "https://github.com/mfumagalli", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "m.fumagalli@imperial.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:ngstools", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsTools", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Nucleic acid sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2478"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Collection of programs for population genetics analyses from NGS data, taking into account its statistical uncertainty.
