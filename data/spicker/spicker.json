In general, the most populated clusters tend to be closer to the native conformation than the lowest energy structures. To assess the generality of the approach, we applied SPICKER to 1489 representative benchmark proteins \u2264200 residues that cover the PDB at the level of 35% sequence identity; each contains up to 280,000 structure decoys generated using the recently developed TASSER (Threading ASSembly Refinement) algorithm. The best of the top five identified folds has a root-mean-square deviation from native (RMSD) in the top 1.4% of all decoys. For 78% of the proteins, the difference in RMSD from native to the identified models and RMSD from native to the absolutely best individual decoy is below 1 \u00c5 the majority belong to the targets with converged conformational distributions. Although native fold identification from divergent decoy structures remains a challenge, our overall results show significant improvement over our previous clustering algorithms. \u00a9 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "citationCount": 241, "authors": [{"name": "Zhang Y."}, {"name": "Skolnick J."}], "date": "2004-04-30T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Computational Chemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "skolnick@buffalo.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:spicker", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/SPICKER/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Clustering", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3432"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A clustering algorithm to identify the near-native models from a pool of protein structure decoys.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/spicker-20101229-cluster-protein-structures-near-native-model-selection.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "spicker", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:12:43Z", "name": "SPICKER", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/SPICKER/readme", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
