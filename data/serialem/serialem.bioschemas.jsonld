  "sc:description": "Acquire tilt series for electron tomography on Tecnai and JEOL microscopes. It uses an approach based on prediction of specimen position during the tilt series from the position at previous tilts. It does not count on the microscope or the specimen being particularly well-behaved, so unless a prediction appears reliable, it falls back to measuring and adjusting defocus and/or specimen position when necessary.",
