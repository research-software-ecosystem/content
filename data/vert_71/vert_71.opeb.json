Most studies thus far have been primarily focused on environmental factors; behavioural patterns, aquaculture, diseases and limited genetic studies with little to none related to either microRNAs (miRNAs) or transposable elements (TE). Objectives: In order to understand biological roles of TE-derived miR-1269a, we examined expression pattern for miR-1269a and its target gene, KSR2, in various tissues of Sebastes schlegelii. Also, we performed luciferase reporter assay in HINAE cells. Methods: UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/) was used to examine which TE is associated with miR-1269a. For the target genes for miR-1269a, the target genes associated with the miRNA were identified using miRDB (http://www.mirdb.org/) and TargetScan 7.1 (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/). A two-step miRNA kit, HB miR Multi Assay Kit™ System. I was used for the analysis of TE-derived miRNA expression patterns. The 3′UTR of KSR2 gene was cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector. Subsequently co-transfected with miR-1269a mimics to HINAE cells for luciferase reporter assay. Results: MiR-1269a was found to be derived from LTR retrotransposon, MLT2B. LTR-derived miR-1269a was highly expressed in the muscle, liver and gonad tissues of Sebastes schlegelii, but KSR2 revealed high expression in the brain. Co-transfection of KSR2 and miR-1269a mimic to HINAE cells showed high activity of miR-1269a in relation to KSR2. Conclusion: LTR-derived miR-1269a showed enhancer activity with relation to KSR2 in Sebastes schlegelii. The data may be used as a foundation for further investigation regarding correlation of miRNA and target genes in addition to other functional studies of biological significance in Sebastes schlegelii.","authors":["Im J.","Kim W.R.","Lee H.-E.","Kim A.","Kim D.-H.","Choi Y.H.","Cha H.-J.","Kim S.","Kim H.-S."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1007/S13258-019-00880-0","journal":"Genes and Genomics","pmid":"31721105","title":"Expression analysis of LTR-derived miR-1269a and target gene, KSR2 in Sebastes schlegelii","year":"2020-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:vert_71","biotoolsID":"vert_71","description":"Expression analysis of LTR-derived miR-1269a and target gene, KSR2 in Sebastes schlegelii.\n\nSearch for predicted microRNA targets in mammals.\n\n[Go to the newest version of TargetScanHuman].\n\n1.
