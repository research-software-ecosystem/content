summary: rapid annotation of prokaryotic genomes
description: >
   A typical 4 Mbp genome can be fully annotated in less than 10 minutes on a
   quad-core computer, and scales well to 32 core SMP systems. It produces GFF3,
   GBK and SQN files that are ready for editing in Sequin and ultimately submitted
   to Genbank/DDJB/ENA.
version: 1.14.5
