Motivation: The identification of protein-protein interaction (PPI) sites is an important step towards the characterization of protein functional integration in the cell complexity. Experimental methods are costly and time-consuming and computational tools for predicting PPI sites can fill the gaps of PPI present knowledge. Results: We present ISPRED4, an improved structure-based predictor of PPI sites on unbound monomer surfaces. ISPRED4 relies on machine-learning methods and it incorporates features extracted from protein sequence and structure. Cross-validation experiments are carried out on a new dataset that includes 151 high-resolution protein complexes and indicate that ISPRED4 achieves a per-residue Matthew Correlation Coefficient of 0.48 and an overall accuracy of 0.85. Benchmarking results show that ISPRED4 is one of the top-performing PPI site predictors developed so far.","authors":["Savojardo C.","Fariselli P.","Martelli P.L.","Casadio R."],"cit_count":1,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btx044","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"ISPRED4: Interaction sites PREDiction in protein structures with a refining grammar model","type":"Primary","year":"2017-06-01"},{"abstract":"A reliable predictor of protein-protein interaction sites is necessary to investigate and model protein functional interaction networks. Hidden Markov Support Vector Machines (HM-SVM) have been shown to be among the best performing methods on this task. Furthermore, it has been noted that the performance of a predictor improves when its input takes advantage of the difference between observed and predicted residue solvent accessibility. In this paper, for first time, we combine these elements and we present ISPRED2, a new HM-SVMbased method that overpasses the state of the art performance (Q2=0.71 and correlation=0.43). ISPRED2 consists of a sets of Python scripts aimed at integrating the different third-party software to obtain the final prediction. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","authors":["Savojardo C.","Fariselli P.","Piovesan D.","Martelli P.L.","Casadio R."],"cit_count":3,"doi":"10.1007/978-3-642-35686-5_11","journal":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","title":"Machine-learning methods to predict protein interaction sites in folded proteins","type":"Other","year":"2012-12-31"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ispred","biotoolsID":"ispred","description":"Prediction of interaction sites in proteins.","homepage":"http://ispred4.biocomp.unibo.it/","name":"ISPRED","version":["4"]}}
