  "sc:description": "> HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Fast, Robust, and User-Friendly Mass Spectrometry Data Processing Engine for Metabolomics | Analysis of large metabolomic datasets is becoming commonplace with the increased realization of the role that metabolites play in biology and pathophysiology. While there are many open-source analysis tools to extract peaks from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS MS) data, these tools are not very interactive and are suboptimal when a large number of samples are to be analyzed. El-MAVEN is an open-source analysis platform that extends MAVEN and provides fast, powerful, and interactive analysis capabilities especially for datasets containing over 100 samples. The El-MAVEN workflow is easy to use with just four steps from loading data to exporting of the results",
