Predicting the base pairs formed between two interacting sequences remains difficult, at least in part because of the competition between unimolecular and bimolecular structure. Results: Two algorithms were developed for improved prediction of bimolecular RNA structure that consider the competition between self-structure and bimolecular structure. These algorithms utilize two novel approaches to evaluate accessibility: free energy density minimization and pseudo-energy minimization. Free energy density minimization minimizes the folding free energy change per nucleotide involved in an intermolecular secondary structure. Pseudo-energy minimization (called AccessFold) minimizes the sum of free energy change and a pseudo-free energy penalty for bimolecular pairing of nucleotides that are unlikely to be accessible for bimolecular structure. The pseudo-free energy, derived from unimolecular pairing probabilities, is applied per nucleotide in bimolecular pairs, and this approach is able to predict binding sites that are split by unimolecular structures. A benchmark set of 17 bimolecular RNA structures was assembled to assess structure prediction. Pseudo-energy minimization provides a statistically significant improvement in sensitivity over the method that was found in a benchmark to be the most accurate previously available method, with an improvement from 36.8% to 57.8% in mean sensitivity for base pair prediction. Availability and implementation: Pseudo-energy minimization is available for download as AccessFold, under an open-source license and as part of the RNAstructure package, at: http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html.", "citationCount": 7, "authors": [{"name": "Dichiacchio L."}, {"name": "Sloma M.F."}, {"name": "Mathews D.H."}], "date": "2016-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "David Mathews", "url": "http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "David_Mathews@urmc.rochester.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rnastructure", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "RNA secondary structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0278"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:52Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A complete package for RNA and DNA secondary structure prediction and analysis.
