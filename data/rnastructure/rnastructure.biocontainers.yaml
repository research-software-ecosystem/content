description: Rnastructure is a complete package for rna and dna secondary structure  prediction
  and analysis. it includes algorithms for   secondary structure  prediction, including
  facility to predict base pairing probabilities. it  also can be used to predict
  bimolecular structures and can predict the  equilibrium binding affinity of an oligonucleotide
  to a structured rna  target. this is useful for sirna design. it can also predict
  secondary  structures common to two, unaligned sequences, which is much more accurate  than
  single sequence secondary structure prediction. finally, rnastructure  can take
  a number of different types of experiment mapping data to constrain  or restrain
  structure prediction. these include chemical mapping, enzymatic  mapping, nmr, and
  shape data.
