In addition to simple counts, it can derive average nearest neighbors for each cell-type and interaction summary profiles for each celltype. These statistics are derived across images, both overall and regions of interest as defined by user defined masks.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/IrisSpatialFeatures.html","name":"IrisSpatialFeatures","version":["1.3.0"]}}
