  "sc:description": "Do you have thousands of files that you need to run the same program on? Are xargs, GNU parallel, and any of the million workflow management systems not working out for you? This package may be of assistance. It provides a command line tool for parallel execution of many command line tasks on any architecture that supports MPI. It also includes parallel implementations of the Python :func:`map` and :func:`imap` functions and a few handy bits and pieces for logging.",
