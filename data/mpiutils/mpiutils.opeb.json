Are xargs, GNU parallel, and any of the million workflow management systems not working out for you? This package may be of assistance. It provides a command line tool for parallel execution of many command line tasks on any architecture that supports MPI. It also includes parallel implementations of the Python :func:`map` and :func:`imap` functions and a few handy bits and pieces for logging.","homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/bkaehler/mpiutils","name":"mpiutils","version":["1"]}}
