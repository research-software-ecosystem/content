These reads increase the memory and CPU time usage of the assembler and can lead to misassemblies. Results We developed RAMBO-K (Read Assignment Method Based On K-mers), a tool which allows rapid and sensitive removal of unwanted host sequences from NGS datasets. Reaching a speed of 10 Megabases/s on 4 CPU cores and a standard hard drive, RAMBOK is faster than any tool we tested, while showing a consistently high sensitivity and specificity across different datasets. Conclusions RAMBO-K rapidly and reliably separates reads from different species without data preprocessing. It is suitable as a straightforward standard solution for workflows dealing with mixed datasets.
