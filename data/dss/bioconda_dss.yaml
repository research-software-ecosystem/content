description: DSS is an R library performing differntial analysis for count-based sequencing
  data. It detectes differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from RNA-seq, and differentially
  methylated loci or regions (DML/DMRs) from bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq). The core
  of DSS is a new dispersion shrinkage method for estimating the dispersion parameter
  from Gamma-Poisson or Beta-Binomial distributions.
