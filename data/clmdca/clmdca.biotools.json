                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s).Background: Accurate prediction of inter-residue contacts of a protein is important to calculating its tertiary structure. Analysis of co-evolutionary events among residues has been proved effective in inferring inter-residue contacts. The Markov random field (MRF) technique, although being widely used for contact prediction, suffers from the following dilemma: the actual likelihood function of MRF is accurate but time-consuming to calculate; in contrast, approximations to the actual likelihood, say pseudo-likelihood, are efficient to calculate but inaccurate. Thus, how to achieve both accuracy and efficiency simultaneously remains a challenge. Results: In this study, we present such an approach (called clmDCA) for contact prediction. Unlike plmDCA using pseudo-likelihood, i.e., the product of conditional probability of individual residues, our approach uses composite-likelihood, i.e., the product of conditional probability of all residue pairs. Composite likelihood has been theoretically proved as a better approximation to the actual likelihood function than pseudo-likelihood. Meanwhile, composite likelihood is still efficient to maximize, thus ensuring the efficiency of clmDCA. We present comprehensive experiments on popular benchmark datasets, including PSICOV dataset and CASP-11 dataset, to show that: i) clmDCA alone outperforms the existing MRF-based approaches in prediction accuracy. i i) When equipped with deep learning technique for refinement, the prediction accuracy of clmDCA was further significantly improved, suggesting the suitability of clmDCA for subsequent refinement procedure. We further present a successful application of the predicted contacts to accurately build tertiary structures for proteins in the PSICOV dataset. Conclusions: Composite likelihood maximization algorithm can efficiently estimate the parameters of Markov Random Fields and can improve the prediction accuracy of protein inter-residue contacts.",
