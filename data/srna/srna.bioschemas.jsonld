These scripts are not meant to be reusable. Most of the figures and tables underwent post-processing in Excel, Powerpoint, or other GUI softwares, therefore the results will not exactly be the same as they appear in the paper | Download this directory and run the sRNA_analysis.sh script which downloads sRNA-seq reads from the SRA database and processes them. The results are placed in the 'sRNA-seq' directory | Linux operation system with zsh shell",
