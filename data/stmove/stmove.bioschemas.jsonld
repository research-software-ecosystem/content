Simultaneously, methods of analyses and software to apply such methods to movement data have expanded dramatically. Even so, for many interdisciplinary researchers and managers without familiarity with the field of movement ecology and the open-source tools that have been developed, the analysis of movement data has remained an overwhelming challenge. Description Here we present stmove , an R package designed to take individual relocation data and generate a visually rich report containing a set of preliminary results that ecologists and managers can use to guide further exploration of their data",
