      "sc:description": "A uLoop Assembly Clone Verification Tool for Nanopore Sequencing Reads.\n\nCloning has been an integral part of most laboratory research questions and continues to be an essential tool in defining the genetic elements determining life. Cloning can be difficult and time consuming as each plasmid is unique to a particular project and each sequence must be carefully selected, cloned and sequenced to determine correctness. Loop assembly (uLOOP) is a recursive, Golden Gate-like assembly method that allows rapid cloning of domesticated DNA fragments to robustly refactor novel pathways. With uLOOP methodologies, one can clone several sequences directionally to generate a library of transcriptional units (TUs) in plasmids within a single reaction but analysis of the plasmid population has been impeded by current sequencing and analysis methods",
