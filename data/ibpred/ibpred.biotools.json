                "abstract": "© 2022 The AuthorsIon binding proteins (IBPs) can selectively and non-covalently interact with ions. IBPs in phages also play an important role in biological processes. Therefore, accurate identification of IBPs is necessary for understanding their biological functions and molecular mechanisms that involve binding to ions. Since molecular biology experimental methods are still labor-intensive and cost-ineffective in identifying IBPs, it is helpful to develop computational methods to identify IBPs quickly and efficiently. In this work, a random forest (RF)-based model was constructed to quickly identify IBPs. Based on the protein sequence information and residues’ physicochemical properties, the dipeptide composition combined with the physicochemical correlation between two residues were proposed for the extraction of features. A feature selection technique called analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to exclude redundant information. By comparing with other classified methods, we demonstrated that our method could identify IBPs accurately. Based on the model, a Python package named IBPred was built with the source code which can be accessed at https://github.com/ShishiYuan/IBPred.",
