MemLoci scores with accuracy of 70 and generalized correlation coefficient (GCC) of 0.50 on a rigorous homology-unbiased validation set and overpasses other predictors for subcellular localization. The annotation process is based both on inheritance through homology and computational methods. Each submitted protein first retrieves, when available, up to 25 similar proteins (with sequence identity ≥50 and alignment coverage ≥50 on both sequences). This helps the identification of membrane-associated proteins and detailed localization tags. Each protein is also filtered for the presence of a GPI anchor [0.8 false positive rate (FPR)]. A positive score of GPI anchor prediction labels the sequence as exposed to 'Cell surface'. Concomitantly the sequence is analysed for the presence of a signal peptide and classified with MemLoci into one of three discriminated classes. Finally the sequence is filtered for predicting its putative all-alpha protein membrane topology (FPR<1).
