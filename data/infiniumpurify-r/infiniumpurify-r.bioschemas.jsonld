InfiniumPurify is an integrated R pa ckage for est imatin g and accoun ting for tum or puri ty based on DNA methylation Infinium 450 k array data. InfiniumPurify has three main functions getPurity, InfiniumDMC and InfiniumClust, which could infer tumor purity, differential methylation analysis and tumor sample c luster accounting for estimated or user-provided tumor purities, respectively. The InfiniumPurify package provides a comprehensive analysis of tumor purity in cancer methylation research.",
