SciKit-Surgery implements a family of compact, orthogonal, libraries accompanied by robust testing, documentation, and quality control. SciKit-Surgery libraries can be rapidly assembled into testable clinical applications and subsequently translated to production software without the need for software reimplementation. The aim is to support translation from single surgeon trials to multicentre trials in under 2 years. Methods: At the time of publication, there were 13 SciKit-Surgery libraries provide functionality for visualisation and augmented reality in surgery, together with hardware interfaces for video, tracking, and ultrasound sources. The libraries are stand-alone, open source, and provide Python interfaces. This design approach enables fast development of robust applications and subsequent translation. The paper compares the libraries with existing platforms and uses two example applications to show how SciKit-Surgery libraries can be used in practice. Results: Using the number of lines of code and the occurrence of cross-dependencies as proxy measurements of code complexity, two example applications using SciKit-Surgery libraries are analysed. The SciKit-Surgery libraries demonstrate ability to support rapid development of testable clinical applications. By maintaining stricter orthogonality between libraries, the number, and complexity of dependencies can be reduced. The SciKit-Surgery libraries also demonstrate the potential to support wider dissemination of novel research. Conclusion: The SciKit-Surgery libraries utilise the modularity of the Python language and the standard data types of the NumPy package to provide an easy-to-use, well-tested, and extensible set of tools for the development of applications for image-guided interventions. The example application built on SciKit-Surgery has a simpler dependency structure than the same application built using a monolithic platform, making ongoing clinical translation more feasible.",
