                "abstract": "© Copyright © 2021 Huang, Jiang, Liu, Yang and Cao.MALDI-MS-based glycan isotope labeling methods have been effectively and widely used for quantitative glycomics. However, interpretation of the data produced by MALDI-MS is inaccurate and tedious because the bioinformatic tools are inadequate. In this work, we present gQuant, an automated tool for MALDI-MS-based glycan isotope labeling data processing. gQuant was designed with a set of dedicated algorithms to improve the efficiency, accuracy and convenience of quantitation data processing. When tested on the reference data set, gQuant showed a fast processing speed, as it was able to search the glycan data of model glycoproteins in a few minutes and reported more results than the manual analysis did. The reported quantitation ratios matched well with the experimental glycan mixture ratios ranging from 1:10 to 10:1. In addition, gQuant is fully open-source and is coded in Python, which is supported by most operating systems, and it has a user-friendly interface. gQuant can be easily adapted by users for specific experimental designs, such as specific glycan databases, different derivatization types and relative quantitation designs and can thus facilitate fast glycomic quantitation for clinical sample analysis using MALDI-MS-based stable isotope labeling.",
