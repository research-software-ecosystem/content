description: Managing data from large scale projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas
  (TCGA) for further analysis is an important and time consuming step for research
  projects. Several efforts, such as Firehose project, make TCGA pre-processed data
  publicly available via web services and data portals but it requires managing, downloading
  and preparing the data for following steps. We developed an open source and extensible
  R based data client for Firehose pre-processed data and demonstrated its use with
  sample case studies. Results showed that RTCGAToolbox could improve data management
  for researchers who are interested with TCGA data. In addition, it can be integrated
  with other analysis pipelines for following data analysis.
