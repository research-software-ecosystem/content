Functionally important residues that take part, e.g. in ligand binding and protein-protein interactions, are often evolutionarily conserved and are most likely to be solvent-accessible, whereas conserved residues within the protein core most probably have an important structural role in maintaining the protein's fold. Thus, estimated evolutionary rates, as well as relative solvent accessibility predictions, are assigned to each amino acid in the sequence; both are subsequently used to indicate residues that have potential structural or functional importance. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.", "citationCount": 273, "authors": [{"name": "Berezin C."}, {"name": "Glaser F."}, {"name": "Rosenberg J."}, {"name": "Paz I."}, {"name": "Pupko T."}, {"name": "Fariselli P."}, {"name": "Casadio R."}, {"name": "Ben-Tal N."}], "date": "2004-05-22T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "ConSeq Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bioSequence@tauex.tau.ac.il"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:conseq", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://conseq.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence alignment analysis (conservation)", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0448"}, {"term": "Residue interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0272"}, {"term": "Accessible surface calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0384"}, {"term": "Protein model validation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0321"}, {"term": "Protein fold recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:59Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Predicts functionally and structurally important amino acid residues in protein sequences.
