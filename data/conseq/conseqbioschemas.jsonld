  "sc:description": "Predicts functionally and structurally important amino acid residues in protein sequences. The predictions are based on the assumptions that residues of functional importance are often conserved and solvent-accessible, and those of structural importance are often conserved and located in the protein core. A multiple sequence alignment is used to predict the relative solvent accessibility state and the evolutionary rate at each residue.",
