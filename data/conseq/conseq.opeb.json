Functionally important residues that take part, e.g. in ligand binding and protein-protein interactions, are often evolutionarily conserved and are most likely to be solvent-accessible, whereas conserved residues within the protein core most probably have an important structural role in maintaining the protein's fold. Thus, estimated evolutionary rates, as well as relative solvent accessibility predictions, are assigned to each amino acid in the sequence; both are subsequently used to indicate residues that have potential structural or functional importance. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Berezin C.","Glaser F.","Rosenberg J.","Paz I.","Pupko T.","Fariselli P.","Casadio R.","Ben-Tal N."],"cit_count":273,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"14871869","title":"ConSeq: The identification of functionally and structurally important residues in protein sequences","year":"2004-05-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:conseq","biotoolsID":"conseq","description":"Predicts functionally and structurally important amino acid residues in protein sequences. The predictions are based on the assumptions that residues of functional importance are often conserved and solvent-accessible, and those of structural importance are often conserved and located in the protein core.
