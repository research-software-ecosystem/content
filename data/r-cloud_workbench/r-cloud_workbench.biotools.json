Start the workbench by downloading the package for your operating system or via Java Web Start, and you will get access to an instance of R running on one of EBI\u2019s powerful machines. You can install additional packages, upload your own data, work with graphics and collaborate with colleagues, all as if you are running R locally, but unlimited by your machine\u2019s memory, processor or data storage capacity.",

The pipeline starts from raw sequence files and produces standard Bioconductor R objects containing gene or transcript measurements for downstream analysis along with web reports for data quality assessment. It may be run locally on a user's own computer or remotely on a distributed R-cloud farm at the European Bioinformatics Institute. It can be used to analyse user's own datasets or public RNA-seq datasets from the ArrayExpress Archive. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2011. Published by Oxford University Press.",
