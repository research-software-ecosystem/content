This methods report describes the infrastructure and processes used to develop the content and features of the Toolkit. The PhenX consensus process is robust, yet flexible, as evidenced by its application to a range of research domains. During the initial phase of PhenX, from March 2008 through April 2010, working groups of content experts addressed 21 research domains and selected 295 measures for the Toolkit. The PhenX Steering Committee prioritized and defined the scope of the domains and guided the consensus process with input from liaisons representing the National Institutes of Health.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
