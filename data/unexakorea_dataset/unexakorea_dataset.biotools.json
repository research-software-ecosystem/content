    "description": "This Investigationevaluated the in vivo maintenance effect of a sustained-release vitamin formulation developed using the proprietary coating technology of unexakorea Inc. In a mouse model, the formulation demonstrated a stable plasma concentration for approximately 10–12 hours after administration.\nThese findings suggest that the sustained-release formulation may serve as a promising alternative\nto conventional high-absorption formulations, offering improved physiological stability and reduced\nadverse effects associated with excessive absorption\n\nsustained-release, plasma concentration, Lipid Encapsulation Material",
