A server implementation of the UNRES package (http://www.unres.pl) for coarse-grained simulations of protein structures with the physics-based UNRES model, coined a name UNRES server, is presented. In contrast to most of the protein coarsegrained models, owing to its physics-based origin, the UNRES force field can be used in simulations, including those aimed at protein-structure prediction, without ancillary information from structural databases; however, the implementation includes the possibility of using restraints. Local energy minimization, canonical molecular dynamics simulations, replica exchange and multiplexed replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations can be run with the current UNRES server; the latter are suitable for protein-structure prediction. The user-supplied input includes protein sequence and, optionally, restraints from secondary-structure prediction or small x-ray scattering data, and simulation type and parameters which are selected or typed in. Oligomeric proteins, as well as those containing D-amino-acid residues and disulfide links can be treated. The output is displayed graphically (minimized structures, trajectories, final models, analysis of trajectory/ensembles); however, all output files can be downloaded by the user.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Czaplewski C."}, {"name": "Karczynska A."}, {"name": "Sieradzan A.K."}, {"name": "Liwo A."}], "date": "2018-07-02T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Cezary Czaplewski", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "cezary.czaplewski@ug.edu.pl"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Adam Liwo", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "adam.liwo@ug.edu.pl"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:unres", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://unres-server.chem.ug.edu.pl/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular dynamics", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [{"data": {"term": "PDB ID", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1127"}, "format": [{"term": "PDB", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_1476"}]}, {"data": {"term": "Protein sequence", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_2976"}, "format": [{"term": "Textual format", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/format_2330"}]}], "operation": [{"term": "Ab initio structure prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0476"}], "cmd": null, "output": [{"data": {"term": "Protein structure report", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/data_1537"}, "format": []}]}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:59:00Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A server implementation of the UNRES package for coarse-grained simulations of protein structures with the physics-based UNRES model.
