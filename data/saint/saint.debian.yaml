summary: Significance Analysis of INTeractome
description: >
   SAINT implements the scoring algorithm for protein-protein interaction
   data using label free quantitative proteomics data in AP-MS experiments.
   It was used for spectral count data in the yeast kinase interactome work
   not incorporating control purification, as well as a generalized
   implementation for spectral count data with and without control
   purification.
   .
   Alternatively, you can also run SAINT in combination with ProHits.
   .
   The package was written for either doing analysis without or with
   control IPs and
version: 2.5.0
