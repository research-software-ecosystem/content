description: "Microarrays are microscopic plates with carefully arranged short DNA\
  \ strands and/or chemically prepared surfaces to which other DNA preferably binds.\
  \ The amount of DNA binding at different locations of these chips, typically determined\
  \ by a fluorescent dye, is to be interpreted. The technology is typically used with\
  \ DNA that is derived from RNA, i.e to determine the activity of a gene and/or its\
  \ splice variants. But the technology is also used to determine sequence variations\
  \ in genomic DNA. . This Bioconductor package supports the analysis of gene expression\
  \ microarray data, especially the use of linear models for analysing designed experiments\
  \ and the assessment of differential expression. The package includes pre-processing\
  \ capabilities for two-colour spotted arrays. The differential expression methods\
  \ apply to all array platforms and treat Affymetrix, single channel and two channel\
  \ experiments in a unified way.\n"
