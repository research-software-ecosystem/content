                "abstract": "© 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The Citrus genus comprises some of the most important and commonly cultivated fruit plants. Within the last decade, citrus greening disease (also known as huanglongbing or HLB) has emerged as the biggest threat for the citrus industry. This disease does not have a cure yet and, thus, many efforts have been made to find a solution to this devastating condition. There are challenges in the generation of high-yield resistant cultivars, in part due to the limited and sparse knowledge about the mechanisms that are used by the Liberibacter bacteria to proliferate the infection in Citrus plants. Here, we present GreeningDB, a database implemented to provide the annotation of Liberibacter proteomes, as well as the host–pathogen comparactomics tool, a novel platform to compare the predicted interactomes of two HLB host–pathogen systems. GreeningDB is built to deliver a user-friendly interface, including network visualization and links to other resources. We hope that by providing these characteristics, GreeningDB can become a central resource to retrieve HLB-related protein annotations, and thus, aid the community that is pursuing the development of molecular-based strategies to mitigate this disease’s impact. The database is freely available at http://bio-info.usu.edu/GreeningDB/.",
