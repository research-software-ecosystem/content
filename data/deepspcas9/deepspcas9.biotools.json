    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DeepCas9', 'SpCas9 activity prediction DeepSpCas9' | deep learning-based model with unparalleled generalization performance | Abstract We evaluated SpCas9 activities at 12,832 target sequences using a high-throughput approach based on a human cell library containing sgRNA-encoding and target sequence pairs. Deep learning-based training on this large data set of SpCas9-induced indel frequencies led to the development of a SpCas9-activity predicting model named DeepSpCas9. When tested against independently generated data sets (our own and those published by other groups), DeepSpCas9 showed unprecedentedly high generalization performance.
