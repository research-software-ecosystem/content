A large set of high-resolution protein structures is downloaded and surveyed. Their residue-level structural properties are calculated and documented. The statistical distributions and correlations of these properties can be queried and displayed. Tools are also provided for modeling and analyzing a given structure in terms of its residue-level structural properties. In particular, new tools for computing residue-level statistical potentials and displaying residue-level Ramachandran-like plots are developed for structural analysis and refinement. P.R.E.S.S. has been released in R as an open source software package, with a user-friendly GUI, accessible and executable by a public user in any R environment. P.R.E.S.S. can also be downloaded directly at http://www.math.iastate.edu/press/. \u00a9 2012 Imperial College Press.",
