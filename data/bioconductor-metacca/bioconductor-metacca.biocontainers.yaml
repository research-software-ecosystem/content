description: Performs multivariate analysis of a single or multiple gwas based on
  univariate regression coefficients. it allows multivariate representation of both
  phenotype and genotype. it extends the statistical technique of canonical correlation
  analysis to the setting where original individual-level records are not available,
  and employs a covariance shrinkage algorithm to achieve robustness.
