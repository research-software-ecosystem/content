description: SCAN is a microarray normalization method to facilitate personalized-medicine
  workflows. Rather than processing microarray samples as groups, which can introduce
  biases and present logistical challenges, SCAN normalizes each sample individually
  by modeling and removing probe- and array-specific background noise using only data
  from within each array. SCAN can be applied to one-channel (e.g., Affymetrix) or
  two-channel (e.g., Agilent) microarrays. The Universal exPression Codes (UPC) method
  is an extension of SCAN that estimates whether a given gene/transcript is active
  above background levels in a given sample. The UPC method can be applied to one-channel
  or two-channel microarrays as well as to RNA-Seq read counts. Because UPC values
  are represented on the same scale and have an identical interpretation for each
  platform, they can be used for cross-platform data integration.
