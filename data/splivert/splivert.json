    "description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | A Protein Multiple Sequence Alignment Refinement Method Based on Splitting-Splicing Vertically | BACKGROUND:Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a fundamental task in bioinformatics and is required for many biological analysis tasks. The more accurate the alignments are, the more credible the downstream analyses are. Most of the protein MSA algorithms realign alignment to refine it by dividing it into two groups horizontally and realign the two groups. However, this strategy doesn't consider that different regions of the sequences have different conservation, and this property may lead to incorrect residue-residue or residue-gap pairs which could not be corrected by this strategy. METHOD:Here, we present a novel refinement method based on splitting-splicing vertically, called SpliVert",
