    "description": "This package offers functions to process multiple ChIP-seq BAM files and detect allele-specific events. Computes allele counts at individual variants (SNPs/SNVs), implements extensive QC steps to remove problematic variants, and utilizes a bayesian framework to identify statistically significant allele-specific events. It is able to account for copy number differences between the two alleles, a known phenotypical feature of cancer samples.",

                "abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).Allele-specific measurements of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq data are key to dissecting the allelic effects of non-coding variants and their contribution to phenotypic diversity. However, most methods of detecting an allelic imbalance assume diploid genomes. This assumption severely limits their applicability to cancer samples with frequent DNA copy-number changes. Here we present a Bayesian statistical approach called BaalChIP to correct for the effect of background allele frequency on the observed ChIP-seq read counts. BaalChIP allows the joint analysis of multiple ChIP-seq samples across a single variant and outperforms competing approaches in simulations. Using 548 ENCODE ChIP-seq and six targeted FAIRE-seq samples, we show that BaalChIP effectively corrects allele-specific analysis for copy-number variation and increases the power to detect putative cis-acting regulatory variants in cancer genomes.",
