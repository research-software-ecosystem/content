The exact quantities are modeled with two easy-to-interpret parameters (K, L) that allows the user to control the number of outliers (not dysregulated genes/cases) in the solutions. We developed two slightly varying models (INES and GLONE) that fall into the class of NP-Hard optimization problems.",
