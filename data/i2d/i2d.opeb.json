Results: The Online Predicted Human Interaction Database (OPHID) is a web-based database of predicted interactions between human proteins. It combines the literature-derived human PPI from BIND, HPRD and MINT, with predictions made from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus. The 23 889 predicted interactions currently listed in OPHID are evaluated using protein domains, gene co-expression and Gene Ontology terms. OPHID can be queried using single or multiple IDs and results can be visualized using our custom graph visualization program. © The Author 2005. Published by Oxford University Press.
