Published by Oxford University Press.Motivation: Coiled coils are widespread protein domains involved in diverse processes ranging from providing structural rigidity to the transduction of conformational changes. They comprise two or more \u03b1-helices that are wound around each other to form a regular supercoiled bundle. Owing to this regularity, coiled-coil structures can be described with parametric equations, thus enabling the numerical representation of their properties, such as the degree and handedness of supercoiling, rotational state of the helices, and the offset between them. These descriptors are invaluable in understanding the function of coiled coils and designing new structures of this type. The existing tools for such calculations require manual preparation of input and are therefore not suitable for the high-throughput analyses. Results: To address this problem, we developed SamCC-Turbo, a software for fully automated, per-residue measurement of coiled coils. By surveying Protein Data Bank with SamCC-Turbo, we generated a comprehensive atlas of \u223c50 000 coiled-coil regions. This machine learning-ready dataset features precise measurements as well as decomposes coiled-coil structures into fragments characterized by various degrees of supercoiling. The potential applications of SamCC-Turbo are exemplified by analyses in which we reveal general structural features of coiled coils involved in functions requiring conformational plasticity. Finally, we discuss further directions in the prediction and modeling of coiled coils.",
