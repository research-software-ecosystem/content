description: Genome-wide association meta analysis software performs meta-analysis
  of the results of gwa studies of binary or quantitative phenotypes. fixed- and random-effect
  meta-analyses are performed for both directly genotyped and imputed snps using estimates
  of the allelic odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for binary traits, and estimates
  of the allelic effect size and standard error for quantitative phenotypes.
