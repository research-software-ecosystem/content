Fixed- and random-effect meta-analyses are performed for both directly genotyped and imputed SNPs using estimates of the allelic odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for binary traits, and estimates of the allelic effect size and standard error for quantitative phenotypes.","homepage":"https://www.geenivaramu.ee/en/tools/gwama","name":"GWAMA","version":["2.2.2"]}}
