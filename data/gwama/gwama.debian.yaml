description: GWAMA (Genome-Wide Association Meta Analysis) software performs meta-analysis
  of the results of GWA studies of binary or quantitative phenotypes. Fixed- and random-effect
  meta-analyses are performed for both directly genotyped and imputed SNPs using estimates
  of the allelic odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for binary traits, and estimates
  of the allelic effect size and standard error for quantitative phenotypes. GWAMA
  can be used for analysing the results of all different genetic models (multiplicative,
  additive, dominant, recessive). The software incorporates error trapping facilities
  to identify strand alignment errors and allele flipping, and performs tests of heterogeneity
  of effects between studies.
