summary: Genome-Wide Association Meta Analysis
description: >
   GWAMA (Genome-Wide Association Meta Analysis) software performs
   meta-analysis of the results of GWA studies of binary or
   quantitative phenotypes. Fixed- and random-effect meta-analyses are
   performed for both directly genotyped and imputed SNPs using
   estimates of the allelic odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for
   binary traits, and estimates of the allelic effect size and standard
   error for quantitative phenotypes. GWAMA can be used for analysing
   the results of all different genetic models (multiplicative,
   additive, dominant, recessive). The software incorporates error
   trapping facilities to identify strand alignment errors and allele
   flipping, and performs tests of heterogeneity of effects between studies.
