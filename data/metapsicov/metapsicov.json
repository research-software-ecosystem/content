Motivation: Recent developments of statistical techniques to infer direct evolutionary couplings between residue pairs have rendered covariation-based contact prediction a viable means for accurate 3D modelling of proteins, with no information other than the sequence required. To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues. Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts - around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV.", "citationCount": 102, "authors": [{"name": "Jones D.T."}, {"name": "Singh T."}, {"name": "Kosciolek T."}, {"name": "Tetchner S."}], "date": "2015-04-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/contact/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "t.singh@ucl.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:metapsicov", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/MetaPSICOV/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein interaction prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2492"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Algorithm incorporating different approaches of contact predictions implemented with a neural network in order to improve the accuracies of the predicted contacts.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["C"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/metapsicov-1-01-precise-structural-contact-prediction.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "metapsicov", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:51:06Z", "name": "MetaPSICOV", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/introduction/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
