The molecule sulfonylurea MCC950 is a NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor with potential clinical utility. However, the mechanism of action of MCC950 remains unknown. Here, we characterize the mechanism of action of MCC950 in both wild-type and autoinflammatory-related NLRP3 mutants, and demonstrate that MCC950 closes the \u2018open\u2019 conformation of active NLRP3.",
