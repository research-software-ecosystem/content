It has state of the art methods for building and processing the max-tree, and a large set of visualization tools that allow to view the tree and the contents of its nodes. The array-based programming style and max-tree representation used in the toolbox make it simple to use. The intended audience of this toolbox includes mathematical morphology students and researchers that want to develop research in the field and image processing researchers that need a toolbox simple to use and easy to integrate in their applications.","authors":["Souza R.","Rittner L.","Machado R.","Lotufo R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1016/j.softx.2017.03.001","journal":"SoftwareX","title":"iamxt: Max-tree toolbox for image processing and analysis","type":"Primary","year":"2017-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:iamxt","biotoolsID":"iamxt","description":"Iamxt is an array-based max-tree toolbox implemented in Python using the NumPy library for array processing.
