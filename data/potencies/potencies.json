    "description": "Gene-signatures predict biologically relevant dose-response potencies in phenotypic assays.\n\nAbstract Multiplexed gene-signature-based phenotypic assays are increasingly used for the identification and profiling of small molecule-tool compounds and drugs. Here we introduce a method (provided as R-package) for the quantification of the dose-response potency of a gene-signature as EC 50 and IC 50 values. Two signaling pathways were used as models to validate our methods: beta-adrenergic agonistic activity on cAMP generation (dedicated dataset generated for this study) and EGFR inhibitory effect on cancer cell viability. In both cases, potencies derived from multi-gene expression data were highly correlated with orthogonal potencies derived from cAMP and cell growth readouts, and superior to potencies derived from single individual genes.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'gene-signature potencies', 'gene-signature', 'readouts', 'gene-signature-based'",
