We administered a formative objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) to nephrology fellows to assess acute KRT medical knowledge, patient care, and systems-based practice competencies. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS:Prospective cohort study of an educational test using the unified model of construct validity. We tested 117 fellows: 25 (four programs) in 2016 and 92 (15 programs) in 2017; 51 first-year and 66 second-year fellows",
