description: This package enables the detection of driver chromosomal imbalances including
  loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
  data. VegaMC performs a joint segmentation of a dataset and uses a statistical framework
  to distinguish between driver and passenger mutation. VegaMC has been implemented
  so that it can be immediately integrated with the output produced by PennCNV tool.
  In addition, VegaMC produces in output two web pages that allows a rapid navigation
  between both the detected regions and the altered genes. In the web page that summarizes
  the altered genes, the link to the respective Ensembl gene web page is reported.
