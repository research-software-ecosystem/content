  "sc:description": "This package enables the detection of driver chromosomal imbalances including loss of heterozygosity (LOH) from array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data. It performs a joint segmentation of a dataset and uses a statistical framework to distinguish between driver and passenger mutations. It also has been implemented so that it can be integrated with the output produced by PennCNV tool.",
