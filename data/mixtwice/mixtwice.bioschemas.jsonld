      "sc:description": "MixTwice is an R package for large-scale hypothesis testing for peptide arrays by variance mixing. Peptide microarrays have emerged as a powerful technology in immunoproteomics as they provide a tool to measure the abundance of different antibodies in patient serum samples. The high dimensionality and small sample size of many experiments challenge conventional statistical approaches, including those aiming to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Motivated by limitations in reproducibility and power of current methods, we advance an empirical Bayesian tool that computes local false discovery rate statistics and local false sign rate statistics when provided with data on estimated effects and estimated standard errors from all the measured peptides. As the name suggests, the MixTwice tool involves the estimation of two mixing distributions, one on underlying effects and one on underlying variance parameters",
