  "sc:description": "ARACNE (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks), a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the vast majority of indirect interactions typically inferred by pairwise analysis.",
