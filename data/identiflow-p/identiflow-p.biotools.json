    "description": "Identifiability and experimental design in perturbation studies.\n\nInteraction strengths between nodes in directed networks can be quantified from observations of the network's response to perturbations. This package reveals the identifiability of the inferred network parameters and optimizes experimental design for network perturbation studies. See our publication for details.\n\nYou can install the IdentiFlow package with pip:.\n\nThe package is easy to use and we demonstrate its most relevant features in the example below. You find the example script in identiflow/examples. This folder also contains the scripts that were used to analyse the KEGG pathways, as described in our paper.",
