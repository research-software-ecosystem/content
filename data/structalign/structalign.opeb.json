Comparative analysis of structures of complexes of homologous proteins with DNA is important in the analysis of DNA-protein recognition. Alignment is a necessary stage of the analysis. An alignment is a matching of amino acid residues and nucleotides of one complex to residues and nucleotides of the other. Currently, there are no programs available for aligning structures of DNA-protein complexes. We present the program StructAlign, which should fill this gap. The program inputs a pair of complexes of DNA double helix with proteins and outputs an alignment of DNA chains corresponding to the best spatial fit of the protein chains.","authors":["Popov Y.V.","Galitsyna A.A.","Alexeevski A.V.","Karyagina A.S.","Spirin S.A."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1134/S0006297915110073","journal":"Biochemistry (Moscow)","pmid":"26615437","title":"StructAlign, a program for alignment of structures of DNA-protein complexes","type":"Primary","year":"2015-11-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:StructAlign","biotoolsID":"StructAlign","description":"Program for alignment of structures of DNA-protein complexes.","homepage":"http://mouse.genebee.msu.ru/tools/StructAlign.html","name":"StructAlign"}}
