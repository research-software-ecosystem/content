Using MS-based proteogenomics, many of these events can be confirmed directly at the protein level. However, the integration of large amounts of redundant RNA-seq data and mass spectrometry data poses a challenging problem. Our paper addresses this by construction of a compact database that contains all useful information expressed in RNA-seq reads. Applying our method to cumulative C. elegans data reduced 496.2 GB of aligned RNA-seq SAM files to 410 MB of splice graph database written in FASTA format. This corresponds to 1000× compression of data size, without loss of sensitivity. We performed a proteogenomics study using the custom data set, using a completely automated pipeline, and identified a total of 4044 novel events, including 215 novel genes, 808 novel exons, 12 alternative splicings, 618 gene-boundary corrections, 245 exon-boundary changes, 938 frame shifts, 1166 reverse strands, and 42 translated UTRs. Our results highlight the usefulness of transcript + proteomic integration for improved genome annotations. © 2013 American Chemical Society.","authors":["Woo S.","Cha S.W.","Merrihew G.","He Y.","Castellana N.","Guest C.","Maccoss M.","Bafna V."],"cit_count":75,"doi":"10.1021/pr400294c","journal":"Journal of Proteome Research","title":"Proteogenomic database construction driven from large scale RNA-seq data","type":"Primary","year":"2014-01-03"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:splicedb","biotoolsID":"splicedb","description":"SpliceDB is a software of incorporation of RNA-seq for MS database search","homepage":"http://proteomics.ucsd.edu/software-tools/splicedb-splice-graph-proteomics-tools/","name":"SpliceDB","version":["1.0"]}}
