In many cases, these sequencing reads cannot be assembled into longer contigs. Thus, gene prediction tools that were originally developed for whole-genome analysis are not suitable for processing metagenomes. Orphelia is a program for predicting genes in short DNA sequences that is available through a web server application (http://orphelia.gobics.de). Orphelia utilizes prediction models that were created with machine learning techniques on the basis of a wide range of annotated genomes. In contrast to other methods for metagenomic gene prediction, Orphelia has fragment length-specific prediction models for the two most popular sequencing techniques in metagenomics, chain termination sequencing and pyrosequencing. These models ensure highly specific gene predictions.", "citationCount": 64, "authors": [{"name": "Hoff K.J."}, {"name": "Lingner T."}, {"name": "Meinicke P."}, {"name": "Tech M."}], "date": "2009-08-04T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Orphelia Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "orphelia-info@gobics.de"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:orphelia", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://orphelia.gobics.de", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Homology-based gene prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3663"}, {"term": "Gene prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2454"}, {"term": "tRNA gene prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0464"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Orphelia is a machine learning program for predicting genes in short DNA sequences from metagenomic sequencing projects.
