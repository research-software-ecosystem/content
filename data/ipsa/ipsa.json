The percent-spliced-in (PSI,) metric estimates the incidence of single-exon-skipping events and can be computed directly by counting reads that align to known or predicted splice junctions. However, the majority of human splicing events are more complex than single-exon skipping. Results: In this short report, we present a framework that generalizes the \u03c8 metric to arbitrary classes of splicing events. We change the view from exon centric to intron centric and split the value of into two indices, \u03c85 and, \u03c83 measuring the rate of splicing at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end of the intron, respectively. The advantage of having two separate indices is that they deconvolute two distinct elementary acts of the splicing reaction. The completeness of splicing index is decomposed in a similar way. This framework is implemented as bam2ssj, a BAM-file-processing pipeline for strand-specific counting of reads that align to splice junctions or overlap with splice sites. It can be used as a consistent protocol for quantifying splice junctions from RNA-seq data because no such standard procedure currently exists. \u00a9 2012 The Author.
