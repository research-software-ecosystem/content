                "abstract": "Protein-DNA recognition plays an essential role in the regulation of gene expression. Regulatory proteins are known to recognize specific DNA sequences directly through atomic contacts (intermolecular readout) and/or indirectly through the conformational properties of the DNA (intramolecular readout). However, little is known about the respective contributions made by these so-called direct and indirect readout mechanisms. We addressed this question by making use of information extracted from a structural database containing many protein-DNA complexes. We quantified the specificity of intermolecular (direct) readout by statistical analysis of base-amino acid interactions within protein-DNA complexes. The specificity of the intramolecular (indirect) readout due to DNA was quantified by statistical analysis of the sequence-dependent DNA conformation. Systematic comparison of these specificities in a large number of protein-DNA complexes revealed that both intermolecular and intramolecular readouts contribute to the specificity of protein-DNA recognition, and that their relative contributions vary depending upon the protein-DNA complexes. We demonstrated that combination of the intermolecular and intramolecular energies derived from the statistical analyses lead to enhanced specificity, and that the combined energy could explain experimental data on binding affinity changes caused by base mutations. These results provided new insight into the relationship between specificity and structure in the process of protein-DNA recognition, which would lead to prediction of specific protein-DNA binding sites. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

                "abstract": "Asymmetric binding of protein homodimers to DNA, which has been observed in a number of protein-DNA complexes, leads to subtle structural differences between the two subunits. Such structural differences are frequently observed when the subunits form cognate and non-cognate protein-DNA complexes, respectively. Analysis of these structural effects on binding specificity should provide insight into the mechanism of protein-DNA recognition. We previously derived empirical potential functions for specific nucleotide base-amino acid interactions from statistical analyses of the structures of many protein-DNA complexes and used a combinatorial threading procedure to evaluate the fitness of the DNA sequences involved. We then introduced Z-scores to measure the specificity with which proteins bind to DNA within complexes, as compared to random DNA sequences. Here, we examined in detail the structural effects of asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding on specificity. Marked differences in the specificity of DNA binding were observed for the two subunits of λ repressor, the glucocorticoid receptor, and for transcription factors containing a Zn2Cys6 binuclear cluster domain, which are known to bind asymmetrically to DNA. Moreover, the differences in the specificity with which Bam H1 and Eco RV endonucleases bind to their cognate and non-cognate DNA sequences were clearly detected using this approach; indeed, analysis of Eco RV binding enabled us to show the cooperative effect of sequence and structure on binding specificity. The present results demonstrate the utility of this approach when examining the structure-specificity relationship in protein-DNA recognition, as subtle structural differences in symmetric/asymmetric and cognate/non-cognate binding were clearly shown to cause marked differences in specificity. This method can also be used as a tool for checking new structures of protein-DNA complexes for their specificity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",

                "abstract": "Regulatory proteins play a critical role in controlling complex spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression in higher organism, by recognizing multiple DNA sequences and regulating multiple target genes. Increasing amounts of structural data on the protein-DNA complex provides clues for the mechanism of target recognition by regulatory proteins. The analyses of the propensities of base-amino acid interactions observed in those structural data show that there is no one-to-one correspondence in the interaction, but clear preferences exist. On the other hand, the analysis of spatial distribution of amino acids around bases shows that even those amino acids with strong base preference such as Arg with G are distributed in a wide space around bases. Thus, amino acids with many different geometries can form a similar type of interaction with bases. The redundancy and structural flexibility in the interaction suggest that there are no simple rules in the sequence recognition, and its prediction is not straightforward. However, the spatial distributions of amino acids around bases indicate a possibility that the structural data can be used to derive empirical interaction potentials between amino acids and bases. Such information extracted from structural databases has been successfully used to predict amino acid sequences that fold into particular protein structures. We surmised that the structures of protein-DNA complexes could be used to predict DNA target sites for regulatory proteins, because determining DNA sequences that bind to a particular protein structure should be similar to finding amino acid sequences that fold into a particular structure. Here we demonstrate that the structural data can be used to predict DNA target sequences for regulatory proteins. Pairwise potentials that determine the interaction between bases and amino acids were empirically derived from the structural data. These potentials were then used to examine the compatibility between DNA sequences and the protein-DNA complex structure in a combinatorial 'threading' procedure. We applied this strategy to the structures of protein-DNA complexes to predict DNA binding sites recognized by regulatory proteins. To test the applicability of this method in target-site prediction, we examined the effects of cognate and noncognate binding, cooperative binding, and DNA deformation on the binding specificity, and predicted binding sites in real promoters and compared with experimental data. These results show that target binding sites for several regulatory proteins are successfully predicted, and our data suggest that this method can serve as a powerful tool for predicting multiple target sites and target genes for regulatory proteins.",

                "abstract": "Protein-DNA interactions play a central role in regulatory processes at the genetic level. DNA-binding proteins recognize their targets by direct base-amino acid interactions and indirect conformational energy contribution from DNA deformations and elasticity. Knowledge-based approach based on the statistical analysis of protein-DNA complex structures has been successfully used to calculate interaction energies and specificities of direct and indirect readouts in protein-DNA recognition. Here, we have implemented the method as a webserver, which calculates direct and indirect readout energies and Z-scores, as a measure of specificity, using atomic coordinates of protein-DNA complexes. This server is freely available at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/readout/. The only input to this webserver is the Protein Data Bank (PDB) style coordinate data of atoms or the PDB code itself. The server returns total energy Z-scores, which estimate the degree of sequence specificity of the protein-DNA complex. This webserver is expected to be useful for estimating interaction energy and DNA conformation energy, and relative contributions to the specificity from direct and indirect readout. It may also be useful for checking the quality of protein-DNA complex structures, and for engineering proteins and target DNAs. © The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press.
