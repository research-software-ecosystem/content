                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019 by the authors.The intrinsic regeneration potential of hyaline cartilage is highly limited due to the absence of blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, as well as a low cell turnover within the tissue. Despite various advancements in the field of regenerative medicine, it remains a challenge to remedy articular cartilage defects resulting from trauma, aging, or osteoarthritis. Among various approaches, tissue engineering using tailored electroactive scaffolds has evolved as a promising strategy to repair damaged cartilage tissue. In this approach, hydrogel scaffolds are used as artificial extracellular matrices, and electric stimulation is applied to facilitate proliferation, differentiation, and cell growth at the defect site. In this regard, we present a simulation model of electroactive hydrogels to be used for cartilage-tissue engineering employing open-source finite-element software FEniCS together with a Python interface. The proposed mathematical formulation was first validated with an example from the literature. Then, we computed the effect of electric stimulation on a circular hydrogel sample that served as a model for a cartilage-repair implant.",
