      "sc:description": "> MEDIUM CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | a low-latency raw data streaming interface for real-time MRI-guided radiotherapy | With the recent advent of hybrid MRI-guided radiotherapy systems, continuous intra-fraction MR imaging for motion monitoring has become feasible. The ability to perform real-time custom image reconstructions is however often lacking. In this work we present a low-latency streaming solution, ReconSocket, which provides a real-time stream of k-space data from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to custom reconstruction servers. We determined the performance of the data streaming by measuring the streaming latency (i.e. non-zero time delay due to data transfer and processing) and jitter (i.e. deviations from periodicity) using an ultra-fast 1D MRI acquisition of a moving phantom. Simultaneously, its position was recorded with near-zero time delay",
