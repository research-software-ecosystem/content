description: The package provides tools to model and test the association between
  multiple genotypes and multiple traits, taking into account the prior biological
  knowledge. Genes, and clinical pathways are incorporated in the model as latent
  variables. The method is based on Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA).
