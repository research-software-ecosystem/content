      "sc:description": "SCISSOR is a framework for identifying structural changes in RNA transcripts.\n\nShape Changes In Selecting Sample Outliers in RNA-seq.\n\nSCISSOR (shape changes in selecting sample outliers in RNA-seq) aims for unsupervised screening of a range of structural alterations in RNA-seq data. SCISSOR considers a novel shape property of aligned short read data through a base-level pileup file. This intact and uncompressed view of RNA-seq profile enables the unbiased discovery of structural alterations by looking for anomalous shapes in expression. This approach holds promise for identifying otherwise obscured genetic aberrations. As a result, SCISSOR identifies known as well as novel aberrations including abnormal splicing, intra-/intergenic deletions, small indels, alternative transcription start/termination.",
