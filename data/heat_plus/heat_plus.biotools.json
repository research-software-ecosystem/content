Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.As a key step in advancing the sustainable development goals, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has placed emphasis on building capacity for measuring and monitoring health inequalities. A number of resources have been developed, including the Health Equity Assessment Toolkit (HEAT), a software application that facilitates the assessment of within-country health inequalities. Following user demand, an Upload Database Edition of HEAT, HEAT Plus, was developed. Launched in July 2017, HEAT Plus allows users to upload their own databases and assess inequalities at the global, national or subnational level for a range of (health) indicators and dimensions of inequality. The software is open-source, operates on Windows and Macintosh platforms and is readily available for download from the WHO website. The flexibility of HEAT Plus makes it a suitable tool for both global and national inequality assessments. Further developments will include interactive graphs, maps and translation into different languages.",
