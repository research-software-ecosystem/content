Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The sequence-dependent statistical mechanical properties of fragments of double-stranded DNA is believed to be pertinent to its biological function at length scales from a few base pairs (or bp) to a few hundreds of bp, e.g. indirect read-out protein binding sites, nucleosome positioning sequences, phased A-tracts, etc. In turn, the equilibrium statistical mechanics behaviour of DNA depends upon its ground state configuration, or minimum free energy shape, as well as on its fluctuations as governed by its stiffness (in an appropriate sense). We here present cgDNAweb, which provides browser-based interactive visualization of the sequence-dependent ground states of double-stranded DNA molecules, as predicted by the underlying cgDNA coarse-grain rigid-base model of fragments with arbitrary sequence. The cgDNAweb interface is specifically designed to facilitate comparison between ground state shapes of different sequences. The server is freely available at cgDNAweb.epfl.ch with no login requirement.",
