      "sc:description": "A flexible, scalable bioinformatic pipeline for multi-marker biodiversity assessments.\n\nMetaWorks consists of a Conda environment and Snakemake pipeline that is meant to be run at the command line to bioinformatically processes Illumina paired-end metabarcodes from raw reads through to taxonomic assignments. MetaWorks currently supports a number of popular marker gene amplicons and metabarcodes: COI (eukaryotes), rbcL (eukaryotes, diatoms), ITS (fungi), 16S (prokaryotes), 18S (eukaryotes, diatoms), 12S (fish), and 28S (fungi). Taxonomic assignments are made using the RDP classifier that uses a naive Bayesian method to produce taxonomic assignments with a measure of statistical support at each rank.",
