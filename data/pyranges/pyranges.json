    "description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'AVAILABILITY:PyRanges' | efficient comparison of genomic intervals in Python | (beta) Performant Pythonic GenomicRanges | PyRanges are collections of intervals that support comparison operations (like overlap and intersect) and other methods that are useful for genomic analyses. The ranges can have an arbitrary number of meta-data fields, i.e. columns associated with them | PyRanges is in a beta state. We are extremely responsive to bug-reports, so if you have problems or come across unexpected behavior, please create an issue | GenomicRanges and genomic Rle-objects for Python | Feel free to ask questions of the type \"how do I do X with pyranges?\" on public forums like Stack Overflow, Bioinformatics Stack Exchange or Biostars. You can use endrebak85#gmail.com to point me to the question(s) | \"Finally ... This was what Python badly needed for years.\" - Heng Li",
