  "sc:description": "Graphs are abstract representations of relationships between entities. Through a set of instructions, they are able to convert relationships into nodes and edges. This tool (originally: The RNA sorting hat) leverages the information available from graph properties and the predictive power of support vector machines (SVMs) to classify potential RNA sequences as functional/non-functional and into 1 of 46 Rfam families. In short, GraPPLE predicts the potential function of an ncRNA sequence.",
