Here we describe these features and discuss how they can be used separately or in combinations to support integrative and comparative analysis. © 2014 The Author(s).","authors":["Kalderimis A.","Lyne R.","Butano D.","Contrino S.","Lyne M.","Heimbach J.","Hu F.","Smith R.","Stepan R.","Sullivan J.","Micklem G."],"cit_count":51,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"24753429","title":"InterMine: Extensive web services for modern biology","type":"Other","year":"2014-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:intermine","biotoolsID":"intermine","description":"Open source data warehouse built specifically for the integration and analysis of complex biological data.
