  "sc:description": "A clustering method designed for high dimensional gene expression data, e.g. single-cell transcriptome data. This method can effectively cluster individual cells based on their transcriptomes, producing clustering outputs highly in accordance with the cell type origins. It utilizes the concept of shared nearest neighbor (SNN) to define similarities between data points (cells) and achieve clustering by a graph theory-based algorithm.",
