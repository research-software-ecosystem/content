summary: Sequence Mapping and Alignment Tool
description: >
   SMALT efficiently aligns DNA sequencing reads with a reference genome.
   Reads from a wide range of sequencing platforms, for example Illumina,
   Roche-454, Ion Torrent, PacBio or ABI-Sanger, can be processed including
   paired reads.
   .
   The software employs a perfect hash index of short words (< 20
   nucleotides long), sampled at equidistant steps along the genomic
   reference sequences.
   .
   For each read, potentially matching segments in the reference are
   identified from seed matches in the index and subsequently aligned with
   the read using a banded Smith-Waterman algorithm.
   .
   The best gapped alignments of each read is reported including a score
   for the reliability of the best mapping. The user can adjust the
   trade-off between sensitivity and speed by tuning the length and spacing
   of the hashed words.
   .
   A mode for the detection of split (chimeric) reads is provided.
   Multi-threaded program execution is supported.
