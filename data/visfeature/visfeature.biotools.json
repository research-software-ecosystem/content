All rights reserved.Many efforts have been made in developing bioinformatics algorithms to predict functional attributes of genes and proteins from their primary sequences. One challenge in this process is to intuitively analyze and to understand the statistical features that have been selected by heuristic or iterative methods. In this paper, we developed VisFeature, which aims to be a helpful software tool that allows the users to intuitively visualize and analyze statistical features of all types of biological sequence, including DNA, RNA and proteins. VisFeature also integrates sequence data retrieval, multiple sequence alignments and statistical feature generation functions.",
