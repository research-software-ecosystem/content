Data import, background correction, normalization, and summarization techniques are presented. We introduce a sliding mean method for amplifying signal and reducing noise in the data, and show the value of gathering paired samples from subjects. Useful visual summaries are presented, and we introduce a simple method for setting a decision rule for subject/ peptide responses that can be used with a set of control peptides or placebo subjects.","authors":["Imholte G.","Sauteraud R.","Gottardo R."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4939-3037-1_10","journal":"Methods in Molecular Biology","title":"Analyzing peptide microarray data with the R pepstat package","type":"Primary","year":"2016-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pepstat","biotoolsID":"pepstat","description":"Statistical analysis of peptide microarrays.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pepStat.html","name":"pepStat","version":["1.8.0"]}}
