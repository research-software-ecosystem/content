  "sc:description": "A Cytoscape plugin for functional enrichment visualization. Gene-sets, such as pathways and Gene Ontology terms, are organized into a network (i.e. the \"\"enrichment map\"\"). In this way, mutually overlapping gene-sets cluster together, making interpretation easier. It also enables the comparison of two different enrichment results in the same map.",
