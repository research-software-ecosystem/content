      "sc:description": "TIMER2.0 for analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells.\n\nTumor progression and the efficacy of immunotherapy are strongly influenced by the composition and abundance of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Due to the limitations of direct measurement methods, computational algorithms are often used to infer immune cell composition from bulk tumor transcriptome profiles. These estimated tumor immune infiltrate populations have been associated with genomic and transcriptomic changes in the tumors, providing insight into tumor-immune interactions. However, such investigations on large-scale public data remain challenging. To lower the barriers for the analysis of complex tumor-immune interactions, we significantly improved our previous web platform TIMER",
