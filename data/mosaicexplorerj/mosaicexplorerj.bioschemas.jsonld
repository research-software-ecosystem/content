      "sc:description": "MosaicExplorerJ is an ImageJ macro to stitch 3D tiles from terabyte-size microscopy datasets organized on a regular 2D grid. As opposed to existing software, stitching does not require any prior information on the actual positions of the tiles, or conversion of raw TIFF images to a multi-resolution format for interactive exploration and fast processing. MosaicExplorerJ was specifically designed to process lightsheet microscopy datasets from optically cleared samples. It can handle multiple fluorescence channels, dual-sided lightsheet illumination and dual-sided camera detection.",
