By combining three different indices, the Jaccard index, the Goodman-Kruskal γ function and the domain duplicate index, into a single similarity measure, we propose a method for comparing proteins based on their domain architectures. Results: Evaluation of the method using the eukaryotic orthologous groups of proteins (KOGs) database indicated that it allows the automatic and efficient comparison of multiple-domain proteins, which are usually refractory to classic approaches based on sequence similarity measures. As a case study, the PDZ and LRR_1 domains are used to demonstrate how proteins containing promiscuous domains can be clearly compared using our method. For the convenience of users, a web server was set up where three different query interfaces were implemented to compare different domain architectures or proteins with domain(s), and to identify the relationships among domain architectures within a given KOG from the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins database. Conclusion: The approach we propose is suitable for estimating the similarity of domain architectures of proteins, especially those of multidomain proteins. © 2006 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Lin K.","Zhu L.","Zhang D.-Y."],"cit_count":31,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btl366","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"An initial strategy for comparing proteins at the domain architecture level","type":"Primary","year":"2006-09-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:pdart","biotoolsID":"pdart","description":"PDART is a web site to compare domain architectures or proteins.","homepage":"http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/pdart/","name":"PDART"}}
