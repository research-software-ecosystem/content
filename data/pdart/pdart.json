By combining three different indices, the Jaccard index, the Goodman-Kruskal \u03b3 function and the domain duplicate index, into a single similarity measure, we propose a method for comparing proteins based on their domain architectures. Results: Evaluation of the method using the eukaryotic orthologous groups of proteins (KOGs) database indicated that it allows the automatic and efficient comparison of multiple-domain proteins, which are usually refractory to classic approaches based on sequence similarity measures. As a case study, the PDZ and LRR_1 domains are used to demonstrate how proteins containing promiscuous domains can be clearly compared using our method. For the convenience of users, a web server was set up where three different query interfaces were implemented to compare different domain architectures or proteins with domain(s), and to identify the relationships among domain architectures within a given KOG from the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins database. Conclusion: The approach we propose is suitable for estimating the similarity of domain architectures of proteins, especially those of multidomain proteins. \u00a9 2006 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 31, "authors": [{"name": "Lin K."}, {"name": "Zhu L."}, {"name": "Zhang D.-Y."}], "date": "2006-09-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "linkui@bnu.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pdart", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/pdart/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2422"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "PDART is a web site to compare domain architectures or proteins.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pdart-protein-domain-architecture-retrieval-tool.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "pdart", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:10:11Z", "name": "PDART", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/cmb/pdart/getitem?it=features", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
