  description: toolkit for analysing high-throughput sequencing data
  long_description: " This package installs the command line tools of the bcbio-nextgen\n
    toolkit implementing best-practice pipelines for fully automated high\n throughput
    sequencing analysis.\n .\n A high-level configuration file specifies inputs and
    analysis parameters\n to drive a parallel pipeline that handles distributed execution,\n
    idempotent processing restarts and safe transactional steps.  The project\n contributes
    a shared community resource that handles the data processing\n component of sequencing
    analysis, providing researchers with more time\n to focus on the downstream biology.\n
    .\n This package builds and having it in Debian unstable helps the Debian\n developers
    to synchronize their efforts. But unless a series of external\n dependencies are
    not installed manually, the functionality of bcbio in\n Debian is only a shadow
    of itself. Please use the official distribution\n of bcbio for the time being,
    which means \"use conda\". The TODO file in\n the Debian directory should give
    an overview on progress for Debian\n packaging.\n"
