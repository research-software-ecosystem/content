When comparing two protein structures, almost all currently available PSC servers report a single and sequential (i.e. topological) alignment, whereas the existence of good alternative alignments, including those involving permutations (i.e. non-sequential or non-topological alignments), is well known. We have recently developed a novel PSC method that can detect alternative alignments of statistical significance (alignment similarity P-value <10-5), including structural permutations at all levels of complexity. OPAAS, the server of this PSC method freely accessible at our website (http://opaas.ibms.sinica.edu.tw), provides an easy-to-read hierarchical layout of output to display detailed information on all of the significant alternative alignments detected. Because these alternative alignments can offer a more complete picture on the structural, evolutionary and functional relationship between two proteins, OPAAS can be used in structural bioinformatics research to gain additional insight that is not readily provided by existing PSC servers. \u00a9 2006 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 14, "authors": [{"name": "Shih E.S.C."}, {"name": "Gan R.-C.R."}, {"name": "Hwang M.-J."}], "date": "2006-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:opaas", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://opaas.ibms.sinica.edu.tw/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein property calculation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0250"}, {"term": "Protein structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2487"}, {"term": "Structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0295"}, {"term": "Protein secondary structure comparison", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2488"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:40Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool for investigating structural neighbors that can calculate a structural alignment for two protein structures.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "opaas", "additionDate": "2017-02-10T14:15:16Z", "name": "OPAAS", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
