      "sc:description": "2SigFinder implements multiscale statistical algorithm to predict genomic islands from a single genome. It uses small-scale test with large-scale features to score small region deviating from the host and large-scale statistical test with small-scale features to identify multi-window segments for identification of genomic islands.\n\n2SigFinder is a novel prediction method, the first combined use of small-scale and large-scale statistical testing for genomic island detection. 2SigFinder was tested by genomic island boundary detection and identification of genomic islands or functional features of real biological data.\n\nGenomic island (GI) is a cluster of genes in prokaryotic genomes that have probable horizontal origins.",
