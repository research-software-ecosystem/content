Methodology/Principal Findings: We describe an experimental and computational pipeline yielding millions of reads that can exceed 200 bp with quality scores approaching that of traditional Sanger sequencing. The method combines an automatable gel-less library construction step with paired-end sequencing on a short-read instrument. With appropriately sized library inserts, mate-pair sequences can overlap, and we describe the SHERA software package that joins them to form a longer composite read. Conclusions/Significance: This strategy is broadly applicable to sequencing applications that benefit from low-cost highthroughput sequencing, but require longer read lengths. We demonstrate that our approach enables metagenomic analyses using the Illumina Genome Analyzer, with low error rates, and at a fraction of the cost of pyrosequencing. \u00a9 2010 Rodrigue et al.", "citationCount": 110, "authors": [{"name": "Rodrigue S."}, {"name": "Materna A.C."}, {"name": "Timberlake S.C."}, {"name": "Blackburn M.C."}, {"name": "Malmstrom R.R."}, {"name": "Alm E.J."}, {"name": "Chisholm S.W."}], "date": "2010-08-20T00:00:00Z", "journal": "PLoS ONE"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Eric Alm", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ejalm@mit.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Shandrina Burns", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "burnss@mit.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:she-ra", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://almlab.mit.edu/shera.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequencing error detection", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3195"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:54Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The SHE-RA software turns error-prone short reads into Sanger-quality composite reads.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "she-ra", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:16:26Z", "name": "SHE-RA", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://almlab.mit.edu/shera/SHERA_doc4website_suppmethods.pdf", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
