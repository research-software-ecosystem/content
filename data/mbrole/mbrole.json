Metabolites Biological Role (MBROLE) is a server that performs functional enrichment analysis of a list of chemical compounds derived from a metabolomics experiment, which allows this list to be interpreted in biological terms. Since its release in 2011, MBROLE has been used by different groups worldwide to analyse metabolomics experiments from a variety of organisms. Here we present the latest version of the system, MBROLE2, accessible at http://csbg.cnb.csic.es/mbrole2.MBROLE2 has been supplemented with 10 databases not available in the previous version, which allow analysis over a larger, richer set of vocabularies including metabolite-protein and drug-protein interactions. This new version performs automatic conversion of compound identifiers from different databases, thus simplifying usage. In addition, the user interface has been redesigned to generate an interactive, more intuitive representation of the results.",
