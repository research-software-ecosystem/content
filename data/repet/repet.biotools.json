The main pipelines are (i) TEdenovo, which search for interspersed repeats, build consensus sequences and classify them according to TE features, and (ii)\n TEannot, which mines a genome with a library of TE sequences, for instance the one produced by the TEdenovo pipeline, to provide TE annotations exported into GFF3 files.",

                "abstract": "The techniques that are usually used to detect transposable elements (TEs) in nucleic acid sequences rely on sequence similarity with previously characterized elements. However, these methods are likely to miss many elements in various organisms. We tested two strategies for the detection of unknown elements. The first, which we call \"TBLASTX strategy,\" searches for TE sequences by comparing the six-frame translations of the nucleic acid sequences of known TEs with the genomic sequence of interest. The second, \"repeat-based strategy,\" searches genomic sequences for long repeats and clusters them in groups of similar sequences. TE copies from a given family are expected to cluster together. We tested the Drosophila melanogaster genomic sequence and the recently sequenced Anopheles gambiae genome in which most TEs remain unknown. We showed that the \"TBLASTX strategy\" is very efficient as it detected at least 332 new TE families in D. melanogaster and 400 in A. gambiae. This was unexpected in Drosophila as TEs of this organism have been extensively studied. The \"repeat-based strategy\" appeared to be very inefficient because of two problems: (i) TE copies are heavily deleted and few copies share homologous regions, and (ii) segmental duplications are frequent and it is not easy to distinguish them from TE copies.",

De novo TE annotation is therefore a computational challenge, and we investigated, using current tools in the REPET package, new strategies to overcome the difficulties. We tested our methodological developments on the sequence of the chromosome 3B of the hexaploid wheat; this chromosome is ~1 Gb, one of the 'fattest' genomes ever sequenced. We successfully established various strategies for annotating TEs in such a complex dataset. Our analyses show that all of our strategies can overcome the current limitations for de novo TE discovery in large plant genomes. Relative to annotation based on a library of known TEs, our de novo approaches improved genome coverage (from 84% to 90%), and the number of full length annotated copies from 14 830 to 15 905. We also developed two new metrics for qualifying TE annotation: NTE50 involves measuring the number, and LTE50 the smallest sizes of annotations that cover 50% of the genome. NTE50 decreased the number of annotations from 124 868 to 93 633 and LTE50 increased it from 1839 to 2659. This work shows how to obtain comprehensive and high-quality automatic TE annotation for a number of economically and agronomically important species.",
