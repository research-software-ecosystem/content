The nonuniform distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A sites across the genome implies that, for better understanding the regulatory mechanism of m<sup>6</sup>A, it is indispensable to characterize its sites in a genome-wide scope. Although a series of experimental technologies have been developed in this regard, they are both time-consuming and expensive. With the avalanche of RNA sequences generated in the postgenomic age, it is highly desired to develop computational methods to timely identify their m<sup>6</sup>A sites. In view of this, a predictor called \"iRNA-Methyl\" is proposed by formulating RNA sequences with the \"pseudo dinucleotide composition\" into which three RNA physiochemical properties were incorporated. Rigorous cross-validation tests have indicated that iRNA-Methyl holds very high potential to become a useful tool for genome analysis. For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web-server for iRNA-Methyl has been established at http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iRNA-Methyl by which users can easily get their desired results without needing to go through the mathematical details.", "citationCount": 178, "authors": [{"name": "Chen W."}, {"name": "Feng P."}, {"name": "Ding H."}, {"name": "Lin H."}, {"name": "Chou K.-C."}], "date": "2015-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Analytical Biochemistry"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Hao Lin", "url": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "hlin@uestc.edu.cn"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:irna-methyl", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://lin.uestc.edu.cn/server/iRNA-Methyl", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Methylation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3204"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "This web-server was developed to identify the N6-methyladenosine (m6A).
