Proteins may exist in different source databases and in multiple copies in the same database. UniParc avoids such redundancy by storing each unique sequence only once and giving it a stable and unique identifier (UPI).",

                "abstract": "Summary: UniProt Archive (UniParc) is the most comprehensive, non-redundant protein sequence database available. Its protein sequences are retrieved from predominant, publicly accessible resources. All new and updated protein sequences are collected and loaded daily into UniParc for full coverage. To avoid redundancy, each unique sequence is stored only once with a stable protein identifier, which can be used later in UniParc to identify the same protein in all source databases. When proteins are loaded into the database, database cross-references are created to link them to the origins of the sequences. As a result, performing a sequence search against UniParc is equivalent to performing the same search against all databases cross-referenced by UniParc. UniParc contains only protein sequences and database cross-references; all other information must be retrieved from the source databases. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
