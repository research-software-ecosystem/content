Its protein sequences are retrieved from predominant, publicly accessible resources. All new and updated protein sequences are collected and loaded daily into UniParc for full coverage. To avoid redundancy, each unique sequence is stored only once with a stable protein identifier, which can be used later in UniParc to identify the same protein in all source databases. When proteins are loaded into the database, database cross-references are created to link them to the origins of the sequences. As a result, performing a sequence search against UniParc is equivalent to performing the same search against all databases cross-referenced by UniParc. UniParc contains only protein sequences and database cross-references; all other information must be retrieved from the source databases. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Leinonen R.","Garcia Diez F.","Binns D.","Fleischmann W.","Lopez R.","Apweiler R."],"cit_count":103,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bth191","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"UniProt archive","type":"Primary","year":"2004-11-22"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:uniparc","biotoolsID":"uniparc","description":"UniParc is a comprehensive and non-redundant database that contains most of the publicly available protein sequences in the world.
