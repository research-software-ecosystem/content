description: 'Functions for forward population genetic simulation in asexual populations,
  with special focus on cancer progression. Fitness can be an arbitrary function of
  genetic interactions between multiple genes or modules of genes, including epistasis,
  order restrictions in mutation accumulation, and order effects.  Mutation rates
  can differ between genes, and we can include mutator/antimutator genes (to model
  mutator phenotypes). Simulations use continuous-time models and can include driver
  and passenger genes and modules.  Also included are functions for: simulating random
  DAGs of the type found in Oncogenetic Trees, Conjunctive Bayesian Networks, and
  other cancer progression models; plotting and sampling from single or multiple realizations
  of the simulations, including single-cell sampling; plotting the parent-child relationships
  of the clones; generating random fitness landscapes (Rough Mount Fuji, House of
  Cards, and additive models) and plotting them.'
