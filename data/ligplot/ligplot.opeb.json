The program is completely general for any ligand and can also be used to show other types of interaction in proteins and nucleic acids. It was designed to facilitate the rapid inspection of many enzyme complexes, but has found many other applications. © 1995 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Wallace A.C.","Laskowski R.A.","Thornton J.M."],"cit_count":3163,"journal":"Protein Engineering, Design and Selection","pmid":"7630882","title":"Ligplot: A program to generate schematic diagrams of protein-ligand interactions","year":"1995-02-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:ligplot","biotoolsID":"ligplot","description":"Program which plots schematic diagrams of protein-ligand interactions.","homepage":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/LIGPLOT/","name":"LIGPLOT"}}
