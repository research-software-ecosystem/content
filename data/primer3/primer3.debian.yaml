description: "Primer3 picks primers for Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs), considering\
  \ as criteria oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content and primer-dimer\
  \ possibilities, PCR product size, positional constraints within the source sequence,\
  \ and miscellaneous other constraints. All of these criteria are user-specifiable\
  \ as constraints, and some are specifiable as terms in an objective function that\
  \ characterizes an optimal primer pair.\n"
