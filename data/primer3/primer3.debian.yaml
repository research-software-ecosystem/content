summary: tool to design flanking oligo nucleotides for DNA amplification
description: >
   Primer3 picks primers for Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs), considering as
   criteria oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content and
   primer-dimer possibilities, PCR product size, positional constraints within
   the source sequence, and miscellaneous other constraints. All of these
   criteria are user-specifiable as constraints, and some are specifiable as
   terms in an objective function that characterizes an optimal primer pair.
