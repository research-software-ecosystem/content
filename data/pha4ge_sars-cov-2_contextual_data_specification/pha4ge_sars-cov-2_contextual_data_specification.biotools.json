    "description": "Software package as collection template and associated materials for SARS-CoV-2 metadata.\nContains metadata collection template based on data standard designed to harmonize genomic surveillance contextual data (sample metadata, epidemiological/clinical/laboratory data, methods information) across datasets, laboratories and databases during pandemic, and beyond. Template contains standardized fields, terms and formats for structuring information, and is accompanied by field level reference guide which provides definitions, guidance and examples for populating fields. Fields have been prioritized using colour coding system as required (yellow), recommended (purple), and optional (white). Users can use as much or as little of specification as they wish, according to their needs, and need not share information unless permitted to do so. SOP and protocols for submitting to public repositories are also included.",
