Template contains standardized fields, terms and formats for structuring information, and is accompanied by field level reference guide which provides definitions, guidance and examples for populating fields. Fields have been prioritized using colour coding system as required (yellow), recommended (purple), and optional (white). Users can use as much or as little of specification as they wish, according to their needs, and need not share information unless permitted to do so. SOP and protocols for submitting to public repositories are also included.",
