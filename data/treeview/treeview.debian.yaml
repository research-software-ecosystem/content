description: TreeView X is an open source and multi-platform program to display phylogenetic
  trees. It can read and display NEXUS and Newick format tree files (such as those
  output by PAUP*, ClustalX, TREE-PUZZLE, and other programs). It allows one to order
  the branches of the trees, and to export the trees in SVG format.
