For example, sequencing data of total genomic DNA show significant, yet unexpected enrichments on promoters and exons. This systematic bias is a particular problem for techniques such as chromatin immunoprecipitation, where the signal for a target factor is plotted across genomic features. We have focused on data obtained from Illumina's Genome Analyser platform, where at least three factors contribute to sequence bias: GC content, mappability of sequencing reads, and regional biases that might be generated by local structure. We show that relying on input control as a normalizer is not generally appropriate due to sample to sample variation in bias. To correct sequence bias, we present BEADS (bias elimination algorithm for deep sequencing), a simple three-step normalization scheme that successfully unmasks real binding patterns in ChIP-seq data. We suggest that this procedure be done routinely prior to data interpretation and downstream analyses. \u00a9 2011 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 84, "authors": [{"name": "Cheung M.-S."}, {"name": "Down T.A."}, {"name": "Latorre I."}, {"name": "Ahringer J."}], "date": "2011-08-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Nicole Cheung", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "msc51@cam.ac.uk"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Thomas Down", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "tad26@cam.ac.uk"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Julie Ahringer", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ja219@cam.ac.uk"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:beads", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://beads.sourceforge.net/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Standardisation and normalisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:57Z", "otherID": [], "description": "ChIP-seq data normalization for Illumina", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "beads", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:13:42Z", "name": "BEADS", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://beads.sourceforge.net/manual.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
