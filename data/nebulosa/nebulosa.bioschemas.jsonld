      "sc:description": "Nebulosa recovers single cell gene expression signals by kernel density estimation.\n\nDue to the sparsity observed in single-cell data (e.g. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq), the visualization of cell features (e.g. gene, peak) is frequently affected and unclear, especially when it is overlaid with clustering to annotate cell types. Nebulosa is an R package to visualize data from single cells based on kernel density estimation. It aims to recover the signal from dropped-out features by incorporating the similarity between cells allowing a “convolution” of the cell features.",
