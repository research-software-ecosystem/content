SABIO-RK offers standardized data manually extracted from the literature and data directly submitted from lab experiments. The database content includes kinetic parameters in relation to biochemical reactions and their biological sources with no restriction on any particular set of organisms. Additionally, kinetic rate laws and corresponding equations as well as experimental conditions are represented. All the data are manually curated and annotated by biological experts, supported by automated consistency checks. SABIO-RK can be accessed via web-based user interfaces or automatically via web services that allow direct data access by other tools. Both interfaces support the export of the data together with its annotations in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language), e.g. for import in modelling tools. © The Author(s) 2011.","authors":["Wittig U.","Kania R.","Golebiewski M.","Rey M.","Shi L.","Jong L.","Algaa E.","Weidemann A.","Sauer-Danzwith H.","Mir S.","Krebs O.","Bittkowski M.","Wetsch E.","Rojas I.","Muller W."],"cit_count":102,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkr1046","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"SABIO-RK - Database for biochemical reaction kinetics","type":"Primary","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:sabio-rk_ws","biotoolsID":"sabio-rk_ws","description":"Data in the database can be accessed via web-based user interfaces and web-services offering the possibility of submitting complex searches by defining various search criteria. Currently the database has two different versions of web-based user interface, due to a transition process.
