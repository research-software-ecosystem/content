However, the rabbit genome is still sparsely annotated, thus prohibiting extensive functional analysis of gene sets derived from whole-genome experiments. We developed a web-based application that provides augmented annotation and orthologue analysis for rabbit genes. Importantly, the application allows comprehensive functional analysis through the use of orthologous relationships.Results: Using data extracted from several public bioinformatics repositories we created Better Bunny, a database and query tool that extensively augments the available functional annotation for rabbit genes. Using the complete set of target genes from a commercial rabbit gene expression microarray as our benchmark, we are able to obtain functional information for 88 % of the genes on the microarray. Previously, functional information was available for fewer than 10 % of the rabbit genes.Conclusions: We have developed a freely available, web-accessible bioinformatics tool that enables investigators to quickly and easily perform extensive functional analysis of rabbit genes (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu). The software application fills a critical void for a wide range of biomedical research that relies on the rabbit model and requires characterization of biological function for large sets of genes. © 2012 Craig et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","authors":["Craig D.B.","Kannan S.","Dombkowski A.A."],"cit_count":13,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","pmid":"22568790","title":"Augmented annotation and orthologue analysis for Oryctolagus cuniculus: Better Bunny","year":"2012-05-08"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:better_bunny","biotoolsID":"better_bunny","description":"An easy to use tool designed primarily to augment Agilent’s transcriptome-wide rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, gene expression microarray.","homepage":"http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/BB/","name":"Better Bunny"}}
