However, the rabbit genome is still sparsely annotated, thus prohibiting extensive functional analysis of gene sets derived from whole-genome experiments. We developed a web-based application that provides augmented annotation and orthologue analysis for rabbit genes. Importantly, the application allows comprehensive functional analysis through the use of orthologous relationships.Results: Using data extracted from several public bioinformatics repositories we created Better Bunny, a database and query tool that extensively augments the available functional annotation for rabbit genes. Using the complete set of target genes from a commercial rabbit gene expression microarray as our benchmark, we are able to obtain functional information for 88 % of the genes on the microarray. Previously, functional information was available for fewer than 10 % of the rabbit genes.Conclusions: We have developed a freely available, web-accessible bioinformatics tool that enables investigators to quickly and easily perform extensive functional analysis of rabbit genes (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu). The software application fills a critical void for a wide range of biomedical research that relies on the rabbit model and requires characterization of biological function for large sets of genes. \u00a9 2012 Craig et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 13, "authors": [{"name": "Craig D.B."}, {"name": "Kannan S."}, {"name": "Dombkowski A.A."}], "date": "2012-05-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Alan Dombkowski", "url": "http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "domski@wayne.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:better_bunny", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/BB/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Gene expression analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2495"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "An easy to use tool designed primarily to augment Agilent\u2019s transcriptome-wide rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, gene expression microarray.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["PHP", "SQL", "Python"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/bunny-2-1-functional-annotation-rabbit-gene.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "better_bunny", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:37:23Z", "name": "Better Bunny", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/BB/faqs.php", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": []}
