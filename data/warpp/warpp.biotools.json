    "description": "WarPP places water molecules for the active site of a given PDB file. Based on interaction geometries previously derived from protein crystal structures potential water positions are generated for free interaction directions (lone pairs of acceptors or hydrogen atoms of donors). Every small molecule present in the PDB structure is used to generate an active site of 6.5 Å radius around each atom. Within these active sites water molecules are placed.\nIn the corresponding publication we showed that WarPP is able to place 80% of water molecules within 1.0 Å distance to a crystallographically observed one.",

                "abstract": "© 2018 American Chemical Society.Water molecules are of great importance for the correct representation of ligand binding interactions. Throughout the last years, water molecules and their integration into drug design strategies have received increasing attention. Nowadays a variety of tools are available to place and score water molecules. However, the most frequently applied software solutions require substantial computational resources. In addition, none of the existing methods has been rigorously evaluated on the basis of a large number of diverse protein complexes. Therefore, we present a novel method for placing water molecules, called WarPP, based on interaction geometries previously derived from protein crystal structures. Using a large, previously compiled, high-quality validation set of almost 1500 protein-ligand complexes containing almost 20000 crystallographically observed water molecules in their active sites, we validated our placement strategy. We correctly placed 80% of the water molecules within 1.0 Å of a crystallographically observed one.",
