The web server's core functionality consists of a suite of newly developed tools, called deepTools, that enable users with little bioinformatic background to explore the results of their sequencing experiments in a standardized setting. Users can upload pre-processed files with continuous data in standard formats and generate heatmaps and summary plots in a straight-forward, yet highly customizable manner. In addition, we offer several tools for the analysis of files containing aligned reads and enable efficient and reproducible generation of normalized coverage files. As a modular and open-source platform, deepTools can easily be expanded and customized to future demands and developments. The deepTools webserver is freely available at http://deeptools.ie-freiburg.mpg.de and is accompanied by extensive documentation and tutorials aimed at conveying the principles of deep-sequencing data analysis. The web server can be used without registration. deepTools can be installed locally either stand-alone or as part of Galaxy. \u00a9 2014 The Author(s).", "citationCount": 313, "authors": [{"name": "Ramirez F."}, {"name": "Dundar F."}, {"name": "Diehl S."}, {"name": "Gruning B.A."}, {"name": "Manke T."}], "date": "2014-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "deepToops Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "deeptools@googlegroups.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:deeptools", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Standardisation and normalisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3435"}, {"term": "Visualisation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0337"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:53Z", "otherID": [], "description": "User-friendly tools for the normalization and visualization of deep-sequencing data.", "toolType": ["Suite"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["anupkumar", "anatskiy", "bgruening"]}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "deeptools", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:14:17Z", "name": "DeepTools", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/api.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Mac"]}
