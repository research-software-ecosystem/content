  "sc:description": "Support Vector Machine (SVM) predictor that locates classical nuclear export signals (NESs) in CRM1 cargoes. Export-Karyopherinβ CRM1 recognizes hundreds of broadly functioning proteins. Most CRM1 cargoes contain the classical NES (also known as leucine-rich NESs), a peptide with 8-15 amino acids, regularly spaced with conserved hydrophobic residues.",
