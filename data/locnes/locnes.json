Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Classical nuclear export signals (NESs) are short cognate peptides that direct proteins out of the nucleus via the CRM1-mediated export pathway. CRM1 regulates the localization of hundreds of macromolecules involved in various cellular functions and diseases. Due to the diverse and complex nature of NESs, reliable prediction of the signal remains a challenge despite several attempts made in the last decade. Results: We present a new NES predictor, LocNES. LocNES scans query proteins for NES consensus-fitting peptides and assigns these peptides probability scores using Support Vector Machine model, whose feature set includes amino acid sequence, disorder propensity, and the rank of position-specific scoring matrix score. LocNES demonstrates both higher sensitivity and precision over existing NES prediction tools upon comparative analysis using experimentally identified NESs.", "citationCount": 34, "authors": [{"name": "Xu D."}, {"name": "Marquis K."}, {"name": "Pei J."}, {"name": "Fu S.-C."}, {"name": "Catatay T."}, {"name": "Grishin N.V."}, {"name": "Chook Y.M."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www4.utsouthwestern.edu/chooklab/contactus.htm", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "darui.xu@utsouthwestern.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:locnes", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://prodata.swmed.edu/LocNES/LocNES.php", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Support Vector Machine (SVM) predictor that locates classical nuclear export signals (NESs) in CRM1 cargoes.
