description: This package implements sampling, iteration, and input of FASTQ files.
  The package includes functions for filtering and trimming reads, and for generating
  a quality assessment report. Data are represented as DNAStringSet-derived objects,
  and easily manipulated for a diversity of purposes.  The package also contains legacy
  support for early single-end, ungapped alignment formats.
