Users provide a protein sequence, and PredictProtein reports similar sequences, PROSITE sequence motifs, and various types of structure prediction information.  You can also use META PredictProtein to submit a sequence to one web form and query several other servers at once, retrieving the results by e-mail.",

The goal is to make these powerful and increasingly essential methods more readily available to non-expert users and the bioinformatics community at large. At present META-PP provides access to a selected set of high-quality servers in the areas of comparative modelling, threading/fold recognition, secondary structure prediction and more specialized fields like contact and function prediction.",
