Pathway prediction, thus gives more insight into the folding process and is a valuable guiding tool to search the conformation space. In this paper, we propose a novel 'unfolding' approach to predict the folding pathway. We apply graph-based methods on a weighted secondary structure graph of a protein to predict the sequence of unfolding events. When viewed in reverse this yields the folding pathway. We demonstrate the success of our approach on several proteins whose pathway is partially known. © Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.","authors":["Zaki M.J.","Nadimpally V.","Bardhan D.","Bystroff C."],"cit_count":19,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bth935","journal":"Bioinformatics","title":"Predicting protein folding pathways","type":"Primary","year":"2004-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:unfold","biotoolsID":"unfold","description":"Predict the sequence of protein (un)folding events by recursive min-cut on a weighted secondary structure element graph.","homepage":"http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/www-new/pmwiki.php/Software/Software#toc34","name":"UNFOLD"}}
