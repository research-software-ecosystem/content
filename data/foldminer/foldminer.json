FoldMiner is unique among such algorithms in that it improves both the motif definition and the sensitivity of a structural similarity search by combining the search and motif discovery methods and using information from each process to enhance the other. In a typical run, a query structure is aligned to all structures in one of several databases of single domain targets in order to identify its structural neighbors and to discover a motif that is the basis for the similarity among the query and statistically significant targets. This process is fully automated, but options for manual refinement of the results are available as well. The server uses the Chime plugin and customized controls to allow for visualization of the motif and of structural superpositions. In addition, we provide an interface to the LOCK 2 algorithm for rapid alignments of a query structure to smaller numbers of user-specified targets. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.", "citationCount": 34, "authors": [{"name": "Shapiro J."}, {"name": "Brutlag D."}], "date": "2004-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Nucleic Acids Research"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Jessica Ebert", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "jessicas@stanford.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:foldminer", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://foldminer.stanford.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein structural motif recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0245"}, {"term": "Structural similarity search", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0360"}, {"term": "Query and retrieval", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0224"}, {"term": "Structure alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0295"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "FoldMiner aligns a user-supplied or identified query structure to a database of single domain targets to discover structural neighbours and characteristic motifs.
