description: This package estimates tumor purity, copy number, loss of heterozygosity
  (loh), and status of single nucleotide variants (snvs). it is designed for targeted
  short read sequencing data, integrating well with standard somatic variant detection
  pipelines and supporting for tumor samples without matching normal samples.
