      "sc:description": "CodonAdjust is a free software to optimize a codon nucleotide composition mimicking a certain amino acids profile (AA profile). CodonAdjust formulates the optimization of a codon nucleotide composition as a non-convex optimization problem which minimizes the squared error between the desired and the calculated AA profiles. We provide CodonAdjust with four different options, which have various customization in practical scenarios such as selecting or avoiding specific codons.",
