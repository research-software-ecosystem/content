It runs into a Docker container, ready to be downloaded and used on any operating system supported by Docker.\n\nAll the steps of the pipeline and their dependencies are controlled by SCons so that in case of any stop, like killing by error or even shutting down the computer, it will automatically resume the analysis from the last run process.",
