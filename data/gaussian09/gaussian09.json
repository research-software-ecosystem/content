In the crystal structure, a one-dimensional assembly is mediated from classical N-H\u22efO hydrogen bonds, which includes R 2 2(8), D(2) and some higher-order graph-set motifs. By also considering weak C-H\u22efO=P and C-H\u22efO-C intermolecular interactions, a two-dimensional network extends along the ab plane. The strengths of the hydrogen bonds were evaluated using quantum chemical calculations with the GAUSSIAN09 software package at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The LP(O) to \u03c3\u2217(NH) and \u03c3\u2217(CH) charge-transfer interactions were examined according to second-order perturbation theory in natural bond orbital (NBO) methodology. The hydrogen-bonded clusters of molecules, including N-H\u22efO and C-H\u22efO interactions, were constructed as input files for the calculations and the strengths of the hydrogen bonds are as follows: N-H\u22efO [R 2 2(8)] > N-H\u22efO [D(2)] > C-H\u22efO. The decomposed fingerprint plots show that the contribution portions of the F\u22efH/H\u22efF contacts in both molecules are the largest.",
