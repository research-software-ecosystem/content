In the crystal structure, a one-dimensional assembly is mediated from classical N-H⋯O hydrogen bonds, which includes R 2 2(8), D(2) and some higher-order graph-set motifs. By also considering weak C-H⋯O=P and C-H⋯O-C intermolecular interactions, a two-dimensional network extends along the ab plane. The strengths of the hydrogen bonds were evaluated using quantum chemical calculations with the GAUSSIAN09 software package at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The LP(O) to σ∗(NH) and σ∗(CH) charge-transfer interactions were examined according to second-order perturbation theory in natural bond orbital (NBO) methodology. The hydrogen-bonded clusters of molecules, including N-H⋯O and C-H⋯O interactions, were constructed as input files for the calculations and the strengths of the hydrogen bonds are as follows: N-H⋯O [R 2 2(8)] > N-H⋯O [D(2)] > C-H⋯O. The decomposed fingerprint plots show that the contribution portions of the F⋯H/H⋯F contacts in both molecules are the largest.","authors":["Alviri B.V.","Pourayoubi M.","Farhadipour A.","Kaur M.","Jasinski J.P."],"cit_count":0,"doi":"10.1107/S2053229619011641","journal":"Acta Crystallographica Section C: Structural Chemistry","pmid":"31589159","title":"The synergistic co-operation of N-H⋯O=P hydrogen bonds and C-H⋯OX weak intermolecular interactions (X is =P or-C) in the (CH3O) 2P(O)(NH-NHC6F5) amidophosphoester: A combined X-ray crystallographic and theoretical study","year":"2019-10-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:GAUSSIAN09","biotoolsID":"GAUSSIAN09","description":"The synergistic co-operation of N-H...O=P hydrogen bonds and C-H...OX weak intermolecular interactions (X is =P or -C) in the (CH3O)2P(O)(NH-NHC6F5) amidophosphoester.\n\nExpanding the limits of computational chemistry.\n\nGaussian 16 expands the range of molecules and types of chemical problems that you can model.
