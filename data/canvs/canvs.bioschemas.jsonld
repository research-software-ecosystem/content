      "sc:description": "CANVS is an easy-to-use application for the analysis and visualization of mass spectrometry-based protein-protein interaction/association data. The elucidation of a protein's interaction association network is important for defining its biological function. Mass spectrometry-based proteomic approaches have emerged as powerful tools for identifying protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-protein associations (PPAs). However, interactome association experiments are difficult to interpret, considering the complexity and abundance of data that are generated. Although tools have been developed to identify protein interactions associations quantitatively, there is still a pressing need for easy-to-use tools that allow users to contextualize their results. To address this, we developed CANVS, a computational pipeline that cleans, analyzes, and visualizes mass spectrometry-based interactome association data",
