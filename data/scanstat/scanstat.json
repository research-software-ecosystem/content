This information may be, for example, allele sharing proportions for sib pairs or logarithm of odds (lod) scores in general small families. We focus on a dichotomous outcome variable, for example, case and control individuals or affected-affected versus affected-unaffected siblings, and suitable single-marker statistics. A significant scan statistic based on the single-marker statistics represents evidence of the presence of a susceptibility gene. For a given length of the scan statistic, we assess its significance by Monte Carlo permutation tests. Comparing P values for varying lengths of scan statistics, we treat the smallest observed P value as our statistic of interest and determine its overall significance level. We applied this method to a genome screen with autism families. The result was informative and surprising: A susceptibility region was found (genome-wide significance level, P = 0.038), which is missed with conventional approaches.", "citationCount": 59, "authors": [{"name": "Hoh J."}, {"name": "Ott J."}], "date": "2000-08-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.jurgott.org/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ott@rockefeller.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:scanstat", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.jurgott.org/linkage/scanstat.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genetic mapping", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0282"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:51Z", "otherID": [], "description": "The tool finds a set of contiguous SNPs that jointly are associated with disease.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Pascal"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/scanstat-scan-statistics-disease-gene-association-set-contiguous-snps.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "scanstat", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:59:13Z", "name": "SCANSTAT", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.jurgott.org/linkage/scanstat.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows"]}
