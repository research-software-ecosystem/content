Most genome sequences released today still come with sets of tRNAs and rRNAs as the only annotated RNA elements, ignoring hundreds of other RNA families. We have developed a web environment that is dedicated to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) prediction, annotation, and analysis and allows users to run a variety of tools in an integrated and flexible manner. This environment offers complementary ncRNA gene finders and a set of tools for the comparison, visualization, editing, and export of ncRNA candidates. Predictions can be filtered according to a large set of characteristics. Based on this environment, we created a public website located at http://RNAspace.org. It accepts genomic sequences up to 5 Mb, which permits for an online annotation of a complete bacterial genome or a small eukaryotic chromosome. The project is hosted as a Source Forge project (http://rnaspace.sourceforge.net/).",
