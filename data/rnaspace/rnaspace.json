Most genome sequences released today still come with sets of tRNAs and rRNAs as the only annotated RNA elements, ignoring hundreds of other RNA families. We have developed a web environment that is dedicated to noncoding RNA (ncRNA) prediction, annotation, and analysis and allows users to run a variety of tools in an integrated and flexible manner. This environment offers complementary ncRNA gene finders and a set of tools for the comparison, visualization, editing, and export of ncRNA candidates. Predictions can be filtered according to a large set of characteristics. Based on this environment, we created a public website located at http://RNAspace.org. It accepts genomic sequences up to 5 Mb, which permits for an online annotation of a complete bacterial genome or a small eukaryotic chromosome. The project is hosted as a Source Forge project (http://rnaspace.sourceforge.net/).", "citationCount": 16, "authors": [{"name": "Cros M.-J."}, {"name": "De Monte A."}, {"name": "Mariette J."}, {"name": "Bardou P."}, {"name": "Grenier-Boley B."}, {"name": "Gautheret D."}, {"name": "Touzet H."}, {"name": "Gaspin C."}], "date": "2011-11-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "RNA"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://rnaspace.org/partners", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "Marie-Josee.Cros@inra.fr"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:rnaspace", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.rnaspace.org/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Sequence annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0361"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:50Z", "otherID": [], "description": "A platform which aims at providing an integrated environment for non-coding RNA annotation.
