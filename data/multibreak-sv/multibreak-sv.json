Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Motivation: Structural variation is common in human and cancer genomes. High-throughput DNA sequencing has enabled genome-scale surveys of structural variation. However, the short reads produced by these technologies limit the study of complex variants, particularly those involving repetitive regions. Recent 'third-generation' sequencing technologies provide single-molecule templates and longer sequencing reads, but at the cost of higher per-nucleotide error rates. Results: We present MultiBreak-SV, an algorithm to detect structural variants (SVs) from single molecule sequencing data, paired read sequencing data, or a combination of sequencing data from different platforms. We demonstrate that combining low-coverage third-generation data from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) with high-coverage paired read data is advantageous on simulated chromosomes. We apply MultiBreak-SV to PacBio data from four human fosmids and show that it detects known SVs with high sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we perform a whole-genome analysis on PacBio data from a complete hydatidiform mole cell line and predict 1002 high-probability SVs, over half of which are confirmed by an Illumina-based assembly.", "citationCount": 27, "authors": [{"name": "Ritz A."}, {"name": "Bashir A."}, {"name": "Sindi S."}, {"name": "Hsu D."}, {"name": "Hajirasouliha I."}, {"name": "Raphael B.J."}], "date": "2014-12-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Anna Ritz", "url": "http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "annaritz@vt.edu"}, {"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Benjamin J.
