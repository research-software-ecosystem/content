    "description": "Genome-wide association analysis of age-at-onset traits using Cox mixed-effects models | Abstract Age-at-onset is one of the critical phenotypes in cohort studies of age-related diseases. Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of age-at-onset can provide more insights into genetic effects on disease progression, and transitions between different stages. Moreover, proportional hazards or Cox regression generally achieves higher statistical power in a cohort study than a binary trait using logistic regression. Although mixed-effects models are widely used in GWAS to correct for population stratification and family structure, application of Cox mixed-effects models (CMEMs) to large-scale GWAS are so far hindered by intractable computational intensity. In this work, we propose COXMEG, an efficient R package for conducting GWAS of age-at-onset using CMEMs",
