All rights reserved.Summary: LC/MS-based analysis techniques combined with specialized lipid tool allow for the qualitative and quantitative determination of thousands of lipid molecules. Some recent bioinformatics tools have been developed to study changes in the lipid profile in case-control experiments and correlate these changes to different enzyme activity or gene expression. However, the existing tools have the limitation to treat only the assembled lipid molecules. In reality, each individual molecule can be considered as an assembly of smaller parts, often called building blocks. These are the result of a myriad of biochemical synthesis and transformation processes that, from a systems biology perspective, should not be ignored. Here, we present LipidOne, a new lipidomic tool which highlights all qualitative and quantitative changes in lipid building blocks both among all detected lipid classes and among experimental groups. Thanks to LipidOne, even differences in lipid building blocks can now be linked to the activity of specific classes of enzymes, transcripts and genes. Contact: roberto.pellegrino@unipg.it",
