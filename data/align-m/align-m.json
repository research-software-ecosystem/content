Generally, this is due to a scoring function that does not describe biological reality accurately enough or a heuristic that cannot explore solution space efficiently enough. In this respect, we present a new program, Align-m, that uses a non-progressive local approach to guide a global alignment. Results: Two large test sets were used that represent the entire SCOP classification and cover sequence similarities between 0 and 50% identity. Performance was compared with the publicly available algorithms ClustalW, T-Coffee and DiAlign. In general, Align-m has comparable or slightly higher accuracy in terms of correctly aligned residues, especially for distantly related sequences. Importantly, it aligns much fewer residues incorrectly, with average differences of over 15% compared with some of the other algorithms. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.", "citationCount": 72, "authors": [{"name": "Van Walle I."}, {"name": "Lasters I."}, {"name": "Wyns L."}], "date": "2004-06-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Ivo Van Walle", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ivwalle@vub.ac.be"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:align-m", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinformatics.vub.ac.be/software/software.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Multiple sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0492"}, {"term": "Global alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0496"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Align-m is an accurate and highly versatile multiple alignment program.
