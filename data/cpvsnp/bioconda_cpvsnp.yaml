description: Gene set analysis methods exist to combine SNP-level association p-values
  into gene sets, calculating a single association p-value for each gene set. This
  package implements two such methods that require only the calculated SNP p-values,
  the gene set(s) of interest, and a correlation matrix (if desired). One method (GLOSSI)
  requires independent SNPs and the other (VEGAS) can take into account correlation
  (LD) among the SNPs. Built-in plotting functions are available to help users visualize
  results.
