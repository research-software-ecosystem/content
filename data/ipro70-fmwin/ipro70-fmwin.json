In bacterial DNA, there are specific sequences of nucleotides called promoters that can bind to the RNA polymerase. Sigma70 (\u03c3 70 ) is one of the most important promoter sequences due to its presence in most of the DNA regulatory functions. In this paper, we identify the most effective and optimal sequence-based features for prediction of \u03c3 70 promoter sequences in a bacterial genome. We used both short-range and long-range DNA sequences in our proposed method. A very small number of effective features are selected from a large number of the extracted features using multi-window of different sizes within the DNA sequences. We call our prediction method iPro70-FMWin and made it freely accessible online via a web application established at http://ipro70.pythonanywhere.com/server for the sake of convenience of the researchers. We have tested our method using a standard benchmark dataset. In the experiments, iPro70-FMWin has achieved an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic and accuracy of 0.959 and 90.57%, respectively, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art predictors.", "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"name": "Rahman M.S."}, {"name": "Aktar U."}, {"name": "Jani M.R."}, {"name": "Shatabda S."}], "date": "2019-02-11T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Molecular Genetics and Genomics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Siddiqur Rahman", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "ronicse59@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:iPro70-FMWin", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://ipro70.pythonanywhere.com/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Promoter prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0440"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-05-31T15:58:28Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Identification of Sigma70 promoters using multiple windowing and minimal features.", "toolType": ["Web service"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "iPro70-FMWin", "additionDate": "2019-05-31T15:58:28Z", "name": "iPro70-FMWin", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": "Mature", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
