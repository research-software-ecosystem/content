    "description": "A structure-based approach to predict stability Strengths and Weaknesses of prOTEINs.\n\nSWOTein method evaluates the contribution of each residue in a protein (or protein chain) to its overall stability. The predictions are based on the three dimensional structure of the protein. Residues that contribute very unfavorably to the folding free energy are defined as stability weaknesses and colored in a red scale, whereas residues that show a highly stabilizing contribution are called stability strengths and colored in blu.",
