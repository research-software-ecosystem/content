description: This package provides a client for the bioconductor corresponding web
  resource, which provides a central location where genomic files (e.g., vcf, bed,
  wig) and other resources from standard locations (e.g., ucsc, ensembl) can be discovered.
  the resource includes metadata about each resource, e.g., a textual description,
  tags, and date of modification. the client creates and manages a local cache of
  files retrieved by the user, helping with quick and reproducible access.
