All rights reserved.Summary: Here we introduce Lipid Mini-On, an open-source tool that performs lipid enrichment analyses and visualizations of lipidomics data. Lipid Mini-On uses a text-mining process to bin individual lipid names into multiple lipid ontology groups based on the classification (e.g. LipidMaps) and other characteristics, such as chain length. Lipid Mini-On provides users with the capability to conduct enrichment analysis of the lipid ontology terms using a Shiny app with options of five statistical approaches. Lipid classes can be added to customize the user's database and remain updated as new lipid classes are discovered. Visualization of results is available for all classification options (e.g. lipid subclass and individual fatty acid chains). Results are also visualized through an editable network of relationships between the individual lipids and their associated lipid ontology terms. The utility of the tool is demonstrated using biological (e.g. human lung endothelial cells) and environmental (e.g. peat soil) samples. Availability and implementation: Rodin (R package: https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/Rodin), Lipid Mini-On Shiny app (https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/LipidMiniOn) and Lipid Mini-On online tool (https://omicstools.pnnl.gov/shiny/lipid-mini-on/). Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",
