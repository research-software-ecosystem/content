                "abstract": "\u00a9 2017 The Author(s).Cell state transition is one of the fundamental events in the development of multicellular organisms, and the transition trajectory path has recently attracted much attention. With the accumulation of large amounts of \"-omics\" data, it is becoming possible to get insights into the molecule mechanisms underlying the transitions between cell states. Here, we present CSTEA (Cell State Transition Expression Atlas), a webserver that organizes, analyzes and visualizes the time-course gene expression data during cell differentiation, cellular reprogramming and trans-differentiation in human and mouse. In particular, CSTEA defines gene signatures for uncharacterized stages during cell state transitions, thereby enabling both experimental and computational biologists to better understand the mechanisms of cell fate determination in mammals. To our best knowledge, CSTEA is the first webserver dedicated to the analysis of time-series gene expression data during cell state transitions. CSTEA is freely available at http://comp-sysbio.org/cstea/.",
