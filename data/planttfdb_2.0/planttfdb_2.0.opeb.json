We made detailed annotation including general information, domain feature, gene ontology, expression pattern and ortholog groups, as well as cross references to various databases and literature citations for these TFs classified into 58 newly defined families with computational approach and manual inspection. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for each family can be shown as Weblogo pictures or downloaded as text files. We have redesigned the user interface in the new version. Users can search TFs with much more flexibility through the improved advanced search page, and the search results can be exported into various formats for further analysis. In addition, we now provide web service for advanced users to access PlantTFDB 2.0 more efficiently. © The Author(s) 2010.","authors":["Zhang H.","Jin J.","Tang L.","Zhao Y.","Gu X.","Gao G.","Luo J."],"cit_count":215,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"21097470","title":"PlantTFDB 2.0: Update and improvement of the comprehensive plant transcription factor database","year":"2011-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:planttfdb_2.0","biotoolsID":"planttfdb_2.0","description":"The PlantTFDB 2.0 plant transcription factor (TF) database contains detailed annotation including general information, domain feature, gene ontology, expression pattern and ortholog groups, as well as cross references to various databases and literature citations for these TFs.
