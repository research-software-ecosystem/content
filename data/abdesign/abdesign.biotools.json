Protein Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of The Protein Society.The functional sites of many protein families are dominated by diverse backbone regions that lack secondary structure (loops) but fold stably into their functionally competent state. Nevertheless, the design of structured loop regions from scratch, especially in functional sites, has met with great difficulty. We therefore developed an approach, called AbDesign, to exploit the natural modularity of many protein families and computationally assemble a large number of new backbones by combining naturally occurring modular fragments. This strategy yielded large, atomically accurate, and highly efficient proteins, including antibodies and enzymes exhibiting dozens of mutations from any natural protein. The combinatorial backbone-conformation space that can be accessed by AbDesign even for a modestly sized family of homologs may exceed the diversity in the entire PDB, providing the sub-\u00c5ngstrom level of control over the positioning of active-site groups that is necessary for obtaining highly active proteins. This manuscript describes how to implement the pipeline using code that is freely available at https://github.com/Fleishman-Lab/AbDesign_for_enzymes.",
