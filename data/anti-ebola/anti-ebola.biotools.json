Despite various efforts from researchers worldwide, its mortality and fatality are quite high. For antiviral drug discovery, the computational efforts are considered highly useful. Therefore, we have developed an 'anti-Ebola' web server, through quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship information of available molecules with experimental anti-Ebola activities. Three hundred and five unique anti-Ebola compounds with their respective IC50 values were extracted from the \u2018DrugRepV\u2019 database. Later, the compounds were used to extract the molecular descriptors, which were subjected to regression-based model development. The robust machine learning techniques, namely support vector machine, random forest and artificial neural network, were employed using tenfold cross-validation. After a randomization approach, the best predictive model showed Pearson's correlation coefficient ranges from 0.83 to 0.98 on training/testing (T274) dataset. The robustness of the developed models was cross-evaluated using William\u2019s plot. The highly robust computational models are integrated into the web server. The \u2018anti-Ebola\u2019 web server is freely available at https://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/antiebola. We anticipate this will serve the scientific community for developing effective inhibitors against the Ebola virus. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",
