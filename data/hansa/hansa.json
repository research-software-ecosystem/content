Phenotypic effects of a large number of nsSNPs have not been characterized. Although several methods have been developed to predict the effects of nsSNPs as \"disease\" or \"neutral,\" there is still a need for development of methods with improved prediction accuracies. We, therefore, developed a support vector machine (SVM) based method named Hansa which uses a novel set of discriminatory features to classify nsSNPs into disease (pathogenic) and benign (neutral) types. Validation studies on a benchmark dataset and further on an independent dataset of wellcharacterized known disease and neutral mutations show that Hansa outperforms the other known methods. For example, fivefold cross-validation studies using the benchmark HumVar dataset reveal that at the false positive rate (FPR) of 20% Hansa yields a true positive rate (TPR) of 82% that is about 10% higher than the best-known method. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "citationCount": 37, "authors": [{"name": "Acharya V."}, {"name": "Nagarajaram H.A."}], "date": "2012-02-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Human Mutation"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "H.A.Nagarajaram", "url": "http://www.cdfd.org.in/labpages/computational_biology_group.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "han@cdfd.org.in"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:hansa", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://hansa.cdfd.org.in:8080/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction and recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}, {"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}, {"term": "Genetic variation analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_3197"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Tool to predict the deleterious effects of a mutation by using 10 Neutral- Disease Mis-Sense Mutation Discriminatory (NDMSMD) features.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/hansa-discriminating-disease-and-neutral-human-nssnps.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "hansa", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:46:16Z", "name": "Hansa", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://hansa.cdfd.org.in:8080/index.php?target=method", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
