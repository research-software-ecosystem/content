This article presents the release of Version 3 of MACiE, which not only extends the dataset to 335 entries, covering 182 of the EC sub-subclasses with a crystal structure available (∼90%), but also incorporates greater chemical and structural detail. This version of MACiE represents a shift in emphasis for new entries, from non-homologous representatives covering EC reaction space to enzymes with mechanisms of interest to our users and collaborators with a view to exploring the chemical diversity of life. We present new tools for exploring the data in MACiE and comparing entries as well as new analyses of the data and new searches, many of which can now be accessed via dedicated Perl scripts.","authors":["Holliday G.L.","Andreini C.","Fischer J.D.","Rahman S.A.","Almonacid D.E.","Williams S.T.","Pearson W.R."],"cit_count":53,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"22058127","title":"MACiE: Exploring the diversity of biochemical reactions","year":"2012-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:macie","biotoolsID":"macie","description":"Mechanism, Annotation, and Classification in Enzymes: database of enzyme reaction mechanisms.","homepage":"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/MACiE/","name":"MACIE"}}
