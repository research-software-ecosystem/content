                "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has significantly mutated its genome during the past 3 years, leading to the periodic emergence of several variants. Some of the variants possess enhanced fitness advantage, transmissibility, and pathogenicity and can also reduce vaccine efficacy. Thus, it is important to track the viral evolution to prevent and protect the mankind from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, an interactive web-GUI platform, namely, CoVe-tracker (SARS-CoV-2 evolution tracker), is developed to track its pan proteome evolutionary dynamics (https://project.iith.ac.in/cove-tracker/). CoVe-tracker provides an opportunity for the user to fetch the country-wise and protein-wise amino acid mutations (currently, 44139) of SARS-CoV-2 and their month-wise distribution. It also provides position-wise evolution observed in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Importantly, CoVe-tracker provides month- and country-wise distributions of 2065 phylogenetic assignment of named global outbreak (PANGO) lineages and their 177564 variants. It further provides periodic updates on SARS-CoV-2 variant(s) evolution. CoVe-tracker provides the results in a user-friendly interactive fashion by projecting the results onto the world map (for country-wise distribution) and protein 3D structure (for protein-wise mutation). The application of CoVe-tracker in tracking the closest cousin(s) of a variant is demonstrated by considering BA.4 and BA.5 PANGO lineages as test cases. Thus, CoVe-tracker would be useful in the quick surveillance of newly emerging mutations/variants/lineages to facilitate the understanding of viral evolution, transmission, and disease epidemiology.",
