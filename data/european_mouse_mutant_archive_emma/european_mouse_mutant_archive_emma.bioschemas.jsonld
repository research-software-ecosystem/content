  "sc:description": "INFRAFRONTIER is the European Research Infrastructure for phenotyping and archiving of model mammalian genomes. The core services of INFRAFRONTIER comprise the systemic phenotyping of mouse mutants in the participating mouse clinics, and the archiving and distribution of mouse mutant lines by the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA). \nEMMA is a non-profit repository for the collection, archiving (via cryopreservation) and distribution of relevant mutant mouse strains essential for basic biomedical research. The laboratory mouse is the most important mammalian model for studying genetic and multi-factorial diseases in man. The comprehensive physical and data resources of EMMA support basic biomedical and preclinical research, and the available research tools and mouse models of human disease offer the opportunity to develop a better understanding of molecular disease mechanisms and may provide the foundation for the development of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies.",
