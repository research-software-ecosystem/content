    "description": "visualization and enhanced analysis of circular RNAs via back and canonical forward splicing | An R-shiny app that provides backsplice and canonical splicing analysis for both circRNA and parental transcripts | An R package that provides analysis and visualisation of canonical and backsplice junctions. Takes output provided by the STAR aligner as well as CIRI2 and circExplorer2 output and enables circRNA downstream analysis | Ularcirc manuscript now available through Nucleic Acids Research | Author and maintainer: David Humphreys (d.humphreys at victorchang dot edu dot au) | Ularcirc can annotate circRNA with overlapping gene information. This is obtained from available bioconductor databases. Use the following command to identify what databases to download:",
