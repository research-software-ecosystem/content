                "abstract": "The elucidation of orthology relationships is an important step both in gene function prediction as well as towards understanding patterns of sequence evolution. Orthology assignments are usually derived directly from sequence similarities for large data because more exact approaches exhibit too high computational costs. Here we present PoFF, an extension for the standalone tool Proteinortho, which enhances orthology detection by combining clustering, sequence similarity, and synteny. In the course of this work, FFAdj-MCS, a heuristic that assesses pairwise gene order using adjacencies (a similarity measure related to the breakpoint distance) was adapted to support multiple linear chromosomes and extended to detect duplicated regions. PoFF largely reduces the number of false positives and enables more fine-grained predictions than purely similarity-based approaches. The extension maintains the low memory requirements and the efficient concurrency options of its basis Proteinortho, making the software applicable to very large datasets. © 2014 Lechner et al.",

                "abstract": "Proteinortho is a widely used tool to predict (co)-orthologous groups of genes for any set of species. It finds application in comparative and functional genomics, phylogenomics, and evolutionary reconstructions. With a rapidly increasing number of available genomes, the demand for large-scale predictions is also growing. In this contribution, we evaluate and implement major algorithmic improvements that significantly enhance the speed of the analysis without reducing precision. Graph-based detection of (co-)orthologs is typically based on a reciprocal best alignment heuristic that requires an all vs. all comparison of proteins from all species under study. The initial identification of similar proteins is accelerated by introducing an alternative search tool along with a revised search strategy—the pseudo-reciprocal best alignment heuristic—that reduces the number of required sequence comparisons by one-half. The clustering algorithm was reworked to efficiently decompose very large clusters and accelerate processing. Proteinortho6 reduces the overall processing time by an order of magnitude compared to its predecessor while maintaining its small memory footprint and good predictive quality.",

                "abstract": "Background: Orthology analysis is an important part of data analysis in many areas of bioinformatics such as comparative genomics and molecular phylogenetics. The ever-increasing flood of sequence data, and hence the rapidly increasing number of genomes that can be compared simultaneously, calls for efficient software tools as brute-force approaches with quadratic memory requirements become infeasible in practise. The rapid pace at which new data become available, furthermore, makes it desirable to compute genome-wide orthology relations for a given dataset rather than relying on relations listed in databases.Results: The program Proteinortho described here is a stand-alone tool that is geared towards large datasets and makes use of distributed computing techniques when run on multi-core hardware. It implements an extended version of the reciprocal best alignment heuristic. We apply Proteinortho to compute orthologous proteins in the complete set of all 717 eubacterial genomes available at NCBI at the beginning of 2009. We identified thirty proteins present in 99% of all bacterial proteomes.Conclusions: Proteinortho significantly reduces the required amount of memory for orthology analysis compared to existing tools, allowing such computations to be performed on off-the-shelf hardware. © 2011 Lechner et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",
