                "abstract": "© 2019 The Authors. Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Here, I briefly present a new R package called learnPopGen that has been designed primarily for the purposes of teaching evolutionary biology, population genetics, and evolutionary theory. Functions of the package can be used to conduct simulations and numerical analyses of a wide range of evolutionary phenomena that would typically be covered in advanced undergraduate through graduate-level curricula in population genetics or evolution. For instance, learnPopGen functions can be used to visualize gene frequency changes through time under multiple deterministic and stochastic processes, to compute and animate the changes in phenotypic trait values or distributions under natural selection, to numerically analyze and graph the outcome of simple game theory models, and to plot coalescence within a population experiencing genetic drift, along with a number of other things. Functions have been designed to be maximally didactic and frequently employ compelling animated visualizations. Furthermore, it is straightforward to export plots and animations from R in the form of flat or animated graphics, or as videos. For maximum flexibility, students working with the package can run functions directly in R; however, instructors may choose to guide students less adept in the R environment to one of various web interfaces that I have built for a number of the functions of the package and that are already available online.",
