Used in gatk4.\n\nSparse Array Storage for Genomics.\n\nGenomicsDB, originally from Intel Health and Lifesciences, is built on top of a fork of htslib and a tile-based array storage system for importing, querying and transforming variant data.\n\nOpen source project providing a collaboration to optimizing sparse array storage for genomics.\n\nUsing high-level APIs provided in C++, Java*, and Spark*, users can both write and read variant records to and from GenomicsDB shared-nothing instances in parallel using multiple processes in a Single Process Multiple Data (SPMD) manner.",
