New technologies will make re-sequencing widely available for such applications as identifying genome variations or interrogating the oligonucleotide content of a large sample (e.g. ChIP-sequencing). The increase in speed, sensitivity and availability of sequencing technology brings demand for advances in computational technology to perform associated analysis tasks. The Solexa/Illumina 1G sequencer can produce tens of millions of reads, ranging in length from \u223c25-50 nt, in a single experiment. Accurately mapping the reads back to a reference genome is a critical task in almost all applications. Two sources of information that are often ignored when mapping reads from the Solexa technology are the 3' ends of longer reads, which contain a much higher frequency of sequencing errors, and the base-call quality scores. Results: To investigate whether these sources of information can be used to improve accuracy when mapping reads, we developed the RMAP tool, which can map reads having a wide range of lengths and allows base-call quality scores to determine which positions in each read are more important when mapping. We applied RMAP to analyze data re-sequenced from two human BAC regions for varying read lengths, and varying criteria for use of quality scores. RMAP is freely available for downloading at http://rulai.cshl.edu/rmap/. Conclusion: Our results indicate that significant gains in Solexa read mapping performance can be achieved by considering the information in 3\u2032 ends of longer reads, and appropriately using the base-call quality scores. The RMAP tool we have developed will enable researchers to effectively exploit this information in targeted re-sequencing projects. \u00a9 2008 Smith et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "citationCount": 224, "authors": [{"name": "Smith A.D."}, {"name": "Xuan Z."}, {"name": "Zhang M.Q."}], "date": "2008-02-28T00:00:00Z", "journal": "BMC Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Synamatrix Support", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "enquiries@synamatix.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:sxoligosearch", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.synamatix.com/secondGenSoftware.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Pairwise sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0491"}, {"term": "Global alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0496"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:55Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Commercial platform offered by the Malaysian based Synamatix that aligns Illumina reads against a range of Refseq RNA or NCBI genome builds for a number of organisms.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["ELIXIR-EE"]}, "language": [], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "sxoligosearch", "additionDate": "2017-01-13T13:16:47Z", "name": "SXOligoSearch", "license": null, "documentation": [], "maturity": "Legacy", "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
