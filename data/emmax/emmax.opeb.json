In addition to the efficiency obtained by the EMMA algorithm, EMMAX takes advantage of the fact that each locus explains only a small fraction of complex traits allowing the avoidance of repetitive variance component estimation procedures.","homepage":"http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/emmax/","name":"EMMAX"}}
