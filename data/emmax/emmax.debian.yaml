description: EMMAX is a statistical test for large scale human or model organism association
  mapping accounting for the sample structure. In addition to the computational efficiency
  obtained by EMMA algorithm, EMMAX takes advantage of the fact that each locus explains
  only a small fraction of complex traits, which allows one to avoid repetitive variance
  component estimation procedure, resulting in a significant amount of increase in
  computational time of association mapping using mixed model.
