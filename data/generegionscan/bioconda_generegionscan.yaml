biotools_id: generegionscan
description: A package with focus on analysis of discrete regions of the genome. This
  package is useful for investigation of one or a few genes using Affymetrix data,
  since it will extract probe level data using the Affymetrix Power Tools application
  and wrap these data into a ProbeLevelSet. A ProbeLevelSet directly extends the expressionSet,
  but includes additional information about the sequence of each probe and the probe
  set it is derived from. The package includes a number of functions used for plotting
  these probe level data as a function of location along sequences of mRNA-strands.
  This can be used for analysis of variable splicing, and is especially well suited
  for use with exon-array data.
