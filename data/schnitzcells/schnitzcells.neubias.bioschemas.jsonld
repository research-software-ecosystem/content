  "http://schema.org/description": "<p>Schnitzcells is a MATLAB based software that allows for quantitative analysis of fluorescent time-lapse movies of living cells. The software package is developed most specifically for bacteria and has been instrumental in analyzing E.coli and B. subtilis movies. The software contains functions that segment cells (based on either fluorescence or phase images),tracks cells in a frame-to-frame manner,build lineage trees and quantitatively extracts fluorescence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength: tools for manually editing segmentation and lineage, well documented, free matlab source code, sample data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limitations: no support,&nbsp;changes need to be done directly in the matlab code</p>\r\n",
