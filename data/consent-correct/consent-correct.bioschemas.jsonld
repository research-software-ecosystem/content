      "sc:description": "CONSENT (Scalable long read self-correction and assembly polishing with multiple sequence alignment) is a self-correction method for long reads. It works by, first, computing overlaps between the long reads, in order to define an alignment pile (i.e. a set of overlapping reads used for correction) for each read. Each read's alignment pile is then further divided into smaller windows, that are corrected idependently. First, a multiple alignment strategy is used in order to compute consensus. Then, this consensus is further polished with a local de Bruijn graph, in order to get rid of the remaining errors. Additionally to error correction, CONSENT can also perform assembly polishing.",
