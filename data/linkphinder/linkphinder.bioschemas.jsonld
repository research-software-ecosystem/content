      "sc:description": "Accurate Prediction of Kinase-Substrate Networks Using Knowledge Graphs.\n\nAbstract Phosphorylation of specific substrates by protein kinases is a key control mechanism for vital cell-fate decisions and other cellular processes. However, discovering specific kinase-substrate relationships is timeconsuming and often rather serendipitous. Computational predictions alleviate these challenges, but the current approaches suffer from limitations like restricted kinome coverage and inaccuracy. They also typically utilise only local features without reflecting broader interaction context. To address these limitations, we have developed an alternative predictive model.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| COMMON LINK WITH (PUB. & NAME DIFFERENT) bio.tools/Drug_Targets (INSIGHT-CENTRE.ORG).\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'kinase-substrate'",
