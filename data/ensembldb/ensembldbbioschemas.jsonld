The annotation for the databases are directly fetched from Ensembl using their Perl API. The functionality and data is similar to that of the TxDb packages from the GenomicFeatures package, but, in addition to retrieve all gene/transcript models and annotations from the database, the package provides also a filter framework allowing to retrieve annotations for specific entries.",
