  description: GNU R utilities to create and use an Ensembl based annotation database
  long_description: " The package provides functions to create and use transcript\
    \ centric\n annotation databases/packages. The annotation for the databases are\n\
    \ directly fetched from Ensembl using their Perl API. The functionality\n and\
    \ data is similar to that of the TxDb packages from the\n GenomicFeatures package,\
    \ but, in addition to retrieve all\n gene/transcript models and annotations from\
    \ the database, the ensembldb\n package provides also a filter framework allowing\
    \ to retrieve\n annotations for specific entries like genes encoded on a chromosome\n\
    \ region or transcript models of lincRNA genes.\n"
