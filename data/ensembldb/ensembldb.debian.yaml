description: "The package provides functions to create and use transcript centric\
  \ annotation databases/packages. The annotation for the databases are directly fetched\
  \ from Ensembl using their Perl API. The functionality and data is similar to that\
  \ of the TxDb packages from the GenomicFeatures package, but, in addition to retrieve\
  \ all gene/transcript models and annotations from the database, the ensembldb package\
  \ provides also a filter framework allowing to retrieve annotations for specific\
  \ entries like genes encoded on a chromosome region or transcript models of lincRNA\
  \ genes.\n"
