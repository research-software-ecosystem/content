description: The package provides functions to create and use transcript centric annotation
  databases/packages. The annotation for the databases are directly fetched from Ensembl
  using their Perl API. The functionality and data is similar to that of the TxDb
  packages from the GenomicFeatures package, but, in addition to retrieve all gene/transcript
  models and annotations from the database, the ensembldb package provides also a
  filter framework allowing to retrieve annotations for specific entries like genes
  encoded on a chromosome region or transcript models of lincRNA genes.
