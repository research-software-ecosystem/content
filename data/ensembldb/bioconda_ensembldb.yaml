biotools_id: ensembldb
description: The package provides functions to create and use transcript centric annotation
  databases/packages. The annotation for the databases are directly fetched from Ensembl
  using their Perl API. The functionality and data is similar to that of the TxDb
  packages from the GenomicFeatures package, but, in addition to retrieve all gene/transcript
  models and annotations from the database, ensembldb provides a filter framework
  allowing to retrieve annotations for specific entries like genes encoded on a chromosome
  region or transcript models of lincRNA genes. EnsDb databases built with ensembldb
  contain also protein annotations and mappings between proteins and their encoding
  transcripts. Finally, ensembldb provides functions to map between genomic, transcript
  and protein coordinates.
