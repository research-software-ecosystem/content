We present partiFold-Align, the first algorithm for simultaneous alignment and consensus folding of unaligned protein sequences; the algorithm's complexity is polynomial in time and space. Algorithmically, partiFold-Align exploits sparsity in the set of super-secondary structure pairings and alignment candidates to achieve an effectively cubic running time for simultaneous pairwise alignment and folding. We demonstrate the efficacy of these techniques on transmembrane \u03b2-barrel proteins, an important yet difficult class of proteins with few known three-dimensional structures. Testing against structurally derived sequence alignments, partiFold-Align significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pairwise and multiple sequence alignment tools in the most difficult low-sequence homology case. It also improves secondary structure prediction where current approaches fail. Importantly, partiFold-Align requires no prior training. These general techniques are widely applicable to many more protein families (partiFold-Align is available at http://partifold. csail.mit.edu/). \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"name": "Waldispuhl J."}, {"name": "O'Donnell C.W."}, {"name": "Will S."}, {"name": "Devadas S."}, {"name": "Backofen R."}, {"name": "Berger B."}], "date": "2014-07-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Journal of Computational Biology"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://people.csail.mit.edu/jw/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bab@mit.edu"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:partifold", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://partifold.csail.mit.edu/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein fold recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}, {"term": "Sequence alignment", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0292"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:45Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Software to investigate the folding landscape of TMBs (Transmembrane Beta-barrel Proteins).", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/partifold-transmembrane-beta-barrel-proteins-predictor.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "partifold", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T19:07:47Z", "name": "partiFold", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://partifold.csail.mit.edu/TMB/instructions.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
