description: Algorithm that infers pathway deregulation scores for each tumor sample
  on the basis of expression data. this score is determined, in a context-specific
  manner, for every particular dataset and type of cancer that is being investigated.
  the algorithm transforms gene-level information into pathway-level information,
  generating a compact and biologically relevant representation of each sample.
