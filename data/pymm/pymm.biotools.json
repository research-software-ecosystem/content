                "abstract": "Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods are important tools in molecular modeling as they are able to couple an extended phase space sampling with an accurate description of the electronic properties of the system. Here, we describe a Python software package, called PyMM, which has been developed to apply a QM/MM approach, the perturbed matrix method, in a simple and efficient way. PyMM requires a classical atomic trajectory of the whole system and a set of unperturbed electronic properties of the ground and electronic excited states. The software output includes a set of the most common perturbed properties, such as the electronic excitation energies and the transitions dipole moments, as well as the eigenvectors describing the perturbed electronic states, which can be then used to estimate whatever electronic property. The software is composed of a simple and complete command-line interface, a set of internal input validation, and three main analyses focusing on (i) the perturbed eigenvector behavior, (ii) the calculation of the electronic absorption spectrum, and (iii) the estimation of the free energy differences along a reaction coordinate.",
