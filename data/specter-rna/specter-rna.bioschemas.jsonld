      "sc:description": "Specter: A novel tool for clustering large-scale single cell RNA-seq and multi-modal data. Linear-time cluster ensembles of large-scale single-cell RNA-seq and multimodal data.\n\n\nSpecter is a novel computational method for clustering large-scale single cell RNA-seq data. In addition, Specter can combine the data from different measurements such as RNA measurements and the antibody-derived tags (collected on the same set of cells). Specter runs in linear time with respect to number of cells, thus it is very suitable for analyzing very big single cell RNA-seq data. On a data set comprising 2 million cells from mouse embryos, Specter requires only 26 minutes to compute the clusters.",
