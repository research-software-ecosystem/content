Unlike other popular primer design tools, it is conceived to generate primer libraries with popular PCR polymerase buffers proposed as pre-set options. PrecisePrimer is also meant to design primers in batches, such as for DNA libraries creation of DNA shuffling experiments and to have the simplest interface possible. It integrates the most up-to-date melting temperature algorithms validated with experimental data, and cross validated with other computational tools. We generated a library of primers for the extraction and cloning of 61 genes from yeast DNA genomic extract using default parameters. All primer pairs efficiently amplified their target without any optimization of the PCR conditions. © 2014 The Author(s).","authors":["Pauthenier C.","Faulon J.-L."],"cit_count":3,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"24829457","title":"PrecisePrimer: An easy-to-use web server for designing PCR primers for DNA library cloning and DNA shuffling","year":"2014-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:preciseprimer","biotoolsID":"preciseprimer","description":"Web-based primer design software made to assist experimentalists in any repetitive primer design task such as preparing, cloning and shuffling DNA libraries.","homepage":"https://absynth.issb.genopole.fr/Bioinformatics/tools/PrecisePrimer/","name":"PrecisePrimer"}}
