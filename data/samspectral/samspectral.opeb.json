Then, it builds a graph and after weighting the edges by conductance computation, the graph is passed to a classic spectral clustering algorithm to find and combine the spectral clusters. The resulting connected components estimate biological cell populations in the data sample.","homepage":"http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SamSPECTRAL.html","name":"SamSPECTRAL","version":["1.28.0"]}}
