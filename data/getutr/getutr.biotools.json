Despite the significance of the 3' UTR, there is no popular method for annotating 3' UTRs and for profiling their isoforms. Recently, poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-seq) and other similar methods have successfully been used to annotate 3' UTRs; however, they contain complex RNA-biochemical experimental steps, resulting in a low yield of products. In this paper, we propose heuristic and regression methods to estimate and quantify the usage of 3' UTRs with widely profiled RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. With this approach, the 3' UTR usage estimated from RNA-seq was found to be highly correlated to that of 3P-seq, and poly(A) cleavage signals of 3' UTRs were detected upstream of the predicted poly(A) cleavage sites. Our methods predicted greater number of 3' UTRs than 3P-seq, which allows the profiling of the 3' UTRs of most expressed genes in diverse cell-types, stages, and species. Hence, the computational RNA-seq method for the estimation of the 3' UTR landscape would be useful as a tool for studying not only the functional roles of 3' UTR but also gene regulation by 3' UTR in a cell type-specific context. The method is implemented in open-source code, which is available at http://big.hanyang.ac.kr/GETUTR.",
