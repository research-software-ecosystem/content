Two feed-forward back-propagation networks with a single hidden layer are used where the first-sequence structure network is trained with the multiple sequence alignment in the form of PSI-BLAST-generated position-specific scoring matrices. The initial predictions from the first network and PSIPRED-predicted secondary structure are used as input to the second structure-structure network to refine the predictions obtained from the first net. A significant improvement in prediction accuracy has been achieved by using evolutionary information contained in the multiple sequence alignment. The final network yields an overall prediction accuracy of 75.5% when tested by sevenfold cross-validation on a set of 426 nonhomologous protein chains. The corresponding Qpred, Qobs, and Matthews correlation coefficient values are 49.8%, 72.3%, and 0.43, respectively, and are the best among all the previously published β-turn prediction methods. The Web server BetaTPred2 (http: //www.imtech.res.in/raghava/betatpred2/) has been developed based on this approach.","authors":["Kaur H.","Raghava G.P.S."],"cit_count":107,"journal":"Protein Science","pmid":"12592033","title":"Prediction of β-turns in proteins from multiple alignment using neural network","year":"2003-03-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:betatpred2","biotoolsID":"betatpred2","description":"The aim of this server is to predict beta turns in proteins from multiple alignment by using neural network from the given amino acid sequence.
