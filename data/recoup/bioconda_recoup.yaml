description: recoup calculates and plots signal profiles created from short sequence
  reads derived from Next Generation Sequencing technologies. The profiles provided
  are either sumarized curve profiles or heatmap profiles. Currently, recoup supports
  genomic profile plots for reads derived from ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments. The
  package uses ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap graphics facilities for curve and heatmap
  coverage profiles respectively.
