The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development of scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R, Bioconductor comprises 934 interoperable packages contributed by a large, diverse community of scientists. Packages cover a range of bioinformatic and statistical applications. They undergo formal initial review and continuous automated testing. We present an overview for prospective users and contributors.","authors":["Huber W.","Carey V.J.","Gentleman R.","Anders S.","Carlson M.","Carvalho B.S.","Bravo H.C.","Davis S.","Gatto L.","Girke T.","Gottardo R.","Hahne F.","Hansen K.D.","Irizarry R.A.","Lawrence M.","Love M.I.","MaCdonald J.","Obenchain V.","Oles A.K.","Pages H.","Reyes A.","Shannon P.","Smyth G.K.","Tenenbaum D.","Waldron L.","Morgan M."],"cit_count":671,"doi":"10.1038/nmeth.3252","journal":"Nature Methods","title":"Orchestrating high-throughput genomic analysis with Bioconductor","type":"Other","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:recoup","biotoolsID":"recoup","description":"Calculate and plots signal profiles created from short sequence reads derived from Next Generation Sequencing technologies.
