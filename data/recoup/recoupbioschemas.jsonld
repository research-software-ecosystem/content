The profiles provided are either sumarized curve profiles or heatmap profiles. Currently, it supports genomic profile plots for reads derived from ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments. The package uses ggplot2 and ComplexHeatmap graphics facilities for curve and heatmap coverage profiles respectively.",
