This article describes the web resource developed by the Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI; accessed at https://efi.igb.illinois.edu/) that provides \"genomic enzymology\" tools (\"web tools\") for (1) generating sequence similarity networks (SSNs) for protein families (EFI-EST); (2) analyzing and visualizing genome context of the proteins in clusters in SSNs (in genome neighborhood networks, GNNs, and genome neighborhood diagrams, GNDs) (EFI-GNT); and (3) prioritizing uncharacterized SSN clusters for functional assignment based on metagenome abundance (chemically guided functional profiling, CGFP) (EFI-CGFP). The SSNs generated by EFI-EST are used as the input for EFI-GNT and EFI-CGFP, enabling easy transfer of information among the tools. The networks are visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape, a widely used desktop application; GNDs and CGFP heatmaps summarizing metagenome abundance are viewed within the tools. We provide a detailed example of the integrated use of the tools with an analysis of glycyl radical enzyme superfamily (IPR004184) found in the human gut microbiome. This analysis demonstrates that (1) SwissProt annotations are not always correct, (2) large-scale genome context analyses allow the prediction of novel metabolic pathways, and (3) metagenome abundance can be used to identify/prioritize uncharacterized proteins for functional investigation.",
