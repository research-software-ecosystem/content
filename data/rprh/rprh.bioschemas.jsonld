      "sc:description": "a web-based tool for the inference of potential roles of plant microRNAs in human body.\n\nRPRH is a database for predicted plant microRNA Functions in human. MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules involved in gene expression regulation. Since the finding of cross-kingdom regulation of plant microRNA in 2012 by Zhang et al., increasing evidences suggest that microRNAs could affect gene expression in an inter-species manner. Here we developed the tool for predicting this kind of interactions between plant and human.",
