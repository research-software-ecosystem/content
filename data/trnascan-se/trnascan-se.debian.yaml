  description: detection of transfer RNA genes in genomic sequence
  long_description: " tRNAscan-SE identifies 99-100% of transfer RNA genes in DNA
    sequence while\n giving less than one false positive per 15 gigabases. Two previously
    described\n tRNA detection programs are used as fast, first-pass prefilters to
    identify\n candidate tRNAs, which are then analyzed by a highly selective tRNA
    covariance\n model. This work represents a practical application of RNA covariance
    models,\n which are general, probabilistic secondary structure profiles based
    on\n stochastic context-free grammars. tRNAscan-SE searches at ~ 30 000 bp/s.\n
    Additional extensions to tRNAscan-SE detect unusual tRNA homologues such as\n
    selenocysteine tRNAs, tRNA-derived repetitive elements and tRNA pseudogenes.\n"
