Published by Oxford University Press.State-of-the-art machine reading methods extract, in hours, hundreds of thousands of events from the biomedical literature. However, many of the extracted biomolecular interactions are incorrect or not relevant for computational modeling of a system of interest. Therefore, rapid, automated methods are required to filter and select accurate and useful information. The FiLter for Understanding True Events (FLUTE) tool uses public protein interaction databases to filter interactions that have been extracted by machines from databases such as PubMed and score them for accuracy. Confidence in the interactions allows for rapid and accurate model assembly. As our results show, FLUTE can reliably determine the confidence in the biomolecular interactions extracted by fast machine readers and at the same time provide a speedup in interaction filtering by three orders of magnitude.
