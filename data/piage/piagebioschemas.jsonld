  "sc:description": "Perform estimation of power and sample sizes required to detect genetic and environmental main, as well as gene-environment interaction (GxE) effects in indirect matched case-control studies (1:1 matching). When the hypothesis of GxE is tested, power/sample size will be estimated for the detection of GxE, as well as for the detection of genetic and environmental marginal effects. Furthermore, power estimation is implemented for the joint test of genetic marginal and GxE effects.",
