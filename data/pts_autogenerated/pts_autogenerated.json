    "description": "a pharmaceutical target seeker.\n\nIdentifying protein targets for a bioactive compound is critical in drug discovery. Molecular similarity is a main approach to fish drug targets, and is based upon an axiom that similar compounds may have the same targets. The molecular structural similarity of a compound and the ligand of a known target can be gauged in topological (2D), steric (3D) or static (pharmacophoric) metric. The topologic metric is fast, but unable to represent steric and static profile of a bioactive compound. Steric and static metrics reflect the shape properties of a compound if its structure were experimentally obtained, and could be unreliable if they were based upon the putative conformation data.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| NAME EQUAL TO (PUB.
