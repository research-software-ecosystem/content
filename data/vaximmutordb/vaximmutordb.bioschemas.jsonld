      "sc:description": "VaximmutorDB is database for vaccine immune factors. A \"vaximmutor\" is coined here to represent an immune factors that is triggered by a vaccination and plays a role in vaccine-induced host immunity. Vaximmuntors are specifically targeted by the innate or acquired immune system of the host and are able to induce acquired immunity and protection in the host against infectious and non-infectious diseases. Vaximmutors play important roles in development of vaccines and biological markers for disease diagnosis and analysis of fundamental host immunity against diseases. VaximmutorDB is a web-based central database and analysis system that curates, stores, and analyzes various vaccine-induced immune factors (i.e., Vaximmutors).",
