Lighter avoids counting k-mers. Instead, it uses a pair of Bloom filters, one holding a sample of the input k-mers and the other holding k-mers likely to be correct. As long as the sampling fraction is adjusted in inverse proportion to the depth of sequencing, Bloom filter size can be held constant while maintaining near-constant accuracy. Lighter is parallelized, uses no secondary storage, and is both faster and more memory-efficient than competing approaches while achieving comparable accuracy.","authors":["Song L.","Florea L.","Langmead B."],"cit_count":64,"journal":"Genome biology","pmid":"25398208","title":"Lighter: fast and memory-efficient sequencing error correction without counting","year":"2014-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:lighter","biotoolsID":"lighter","description":"Kmer-based error correction method for whole genome sequencing data. Lighter uses sampling (rather than counting) to obtain a set of kmers that are likely from the genome. Using this information, Lighter can correct the reads containing sequence errors.","homepage":"https://github.com/mourisl/Lighter","name":"Lighter"}}
