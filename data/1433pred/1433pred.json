Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: The 14-3-3 family of phosphoprotein-binding proteins regulates many cellular processes by docking onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues in a constellation of intracellular targets. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an updated set of 14-3-3-binding motifs for the identification of new 14-3-3 targets and to prioritize the downstream analysis of >2000 potential interactors identified in high-throughput experiments. Results: Here, a comprehensive set of 14-3-3-binding targets from the literature was used to develop 14-3-3-binding phosphosite predictors. Position-specific scoring matrix, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification methods were trained to discriminate experimentally determined 14-3-3-binding motifs from non-binding phosphopeptides. ANN, position-specific scoring matrix and SVM methods showed best performance for a motif window spanning from -6 to +4 around the binding phosphosite, achieving Matthews correlation coefficient of up to 0.60. Blind prediction showed that all three methods outperform two popular 14-3-3-binding site predictors, Scansite and ELM. The new methods were used for prediction of 14-3-3-binding phosphosites in the human proteome. Experimental analysis of high-scoring predictions in the FAM122A and FAM122B proteins confirms the predictions and suggests the new 14-3- 3-predictors will be generally useful.", "citationCount": 36, "authors": [{"name": "Madeira F."}, {"name": "Tinti M."}, {"name": "Murugesan G."}, {"name": "Berrett E."}, {"name": "Stafford M."}, {"name": "Toth R."}, {"name": "Cole C."}, {"name": "MacKintosh C."}, {"name": "Barton G.J."}], "date": "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "The Barton Group", "url": "http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/contact.html", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:1433pred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}, {"term": "Protein binding site prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2575"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:43Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Webserver that predicts 14-3-3-binding sites by combining predictions from three different classifiers: ANN, PSSM and SVM.", "toolType": ["Web application"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/14-3-3-pred-webserver-to-predict-14-3-3-binding-sites-in-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "1433pred", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:35:17Z", "name": "14-3-3-Pred", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred/about", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
