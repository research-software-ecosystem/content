Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: The 14-3-3 family of phosphoprotein-binding proteins regulates many cellular processes by docking onto pairs of phosphorylated Ser and Thr residues in a constellation of intracellular targets. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop new prediction methods that use an updated set of 14-3-3-binding motifs for the identification of new 14-3-3 targets and to prioritize the downstream analysis of >2000 potential interactors identified in high-throughput experiments. Results: Here, a comprehensive set of 14-3-3-binding targets from the literature was used to develop 14-3-3-binding phosphosite predictors. Position-specific scoring matrix, support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification methods were trained to discriminate experimentally determined 14-3-3-binding motifs from non-binding phosphopeptides. ANN, position-specific scoring matrix and SVM methods showed best performance for a motif window spanning from -6 to +4 around the binding phosphosite, achieving Matthews correlation coefficient of up to 0.60. Blind prediction showed that all three methods outperform two popular 14-3-3-binding site predictors, Scansite and ELM. The new methods were used for prediction of 14-3-3-binding phosphosites in the human proteome. Experimental analysis of high-scoring predictions in the FAM122A and FAM122B proteins confirms the predictions and suggests the new 14-3- 3-predictors will be generally useful.","authors":["Madeira F.","Tinti M.","Murugesan G.","Berrett E.","Stafford M.","Toth R.","Cole C.","MacKintosh C.","Barton G.J."],"cit_count":36,"journal":"Bioinformatics","pmid":"25735772","title":"14-3-3-Pred: Improved methods to predict 14-3-3-binding phosphopeptides","year":"2015-01-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:1433pred","biotoolsID":"1433pred","description":"Webserver that predicts 14-3-3-binding sites by combining predictions from three different classifiers: ANN, PSSM and SVM.","homepage":"http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/1433pred","name":"14-3-3-Pred"}}
