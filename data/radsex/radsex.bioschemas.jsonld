This workflow contains the software radsex and the R package sgtr; a Snakemake implementation of the workflow is available here.\nThis workflow implements all the analyses presented in the RADSex paper and generates figures for each analyses as well as most figures included in the paper. Data is defined in data/info.tsv; reads are downloaded from the NCBI SRA repository and genomes are downloaded from provided links. All parameters are defined in config.yaml.",
