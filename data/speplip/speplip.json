SPEPlip identifies the presence of sorting signals and predicts their cleavage sites. The accuracy in cross-validation is similar to that of other available programs: the rate of false positives is 4 and 6%, for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively and that of false negatives is 3% in both cases. When a set of 409 prokaryotic lipoproteins is predicted, SPEPlip predicts 97% of the chains in the signal peptide class. However, by integrating SPEPlip with a regular expression search utility based on the PROSITE pattern, we can successfully discriminate signal peptide-containing chains from lipoproteins. We propose the method for detecting and discriminating signal peptides containing chains and lipoproteins. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2001.", "citationCount": 55, "authors": [{"name": "Fariselli P."}, {"name": "Finocchiaro G."}, {"name": "Casadio R."}], "date": "2003-12-12T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.biocomp.unibo.it/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:speplip", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/cgi/predictors/spep/pred_spepcgi.cgi", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Neural network-based method, trained and tested on a set of experimentally derived signal peptides from eukaryotes and prokaryotes, that identifies the presence of sorting signals and predicts their cleavage sites.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl", "C"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/speplip-predictor-signal-peptide-lipoprotein-cleavage-sites-proteins.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "speplip", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:12:43Z", "name": "SPEPLip", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/oldpredictors/spep/info/", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
