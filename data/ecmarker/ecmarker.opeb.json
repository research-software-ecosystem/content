The increasing amount of genomics data gathered from patients allows for better understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms that occur during disease development at a system level. However, integrating such a large amount of population data is still a challenging task. To address this, we developed an interpretable machine learning model, ECMarker, to predict gene expression biomarkers and regulatory networks specific for disease stages such as early cancer. In particular, ECMarker was built on the semi-restricted Boltzmann machine, a machine learning model with multiple hierarchical layers.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.1101/825414","name":"ECMarker"}}
