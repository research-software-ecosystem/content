summary: "This article introduces a new forward population genetic simulation program\
  \ that can efficiently generate samples from populations with complex demographic\
  \ histories under various models of natural selection. The program (SFS_CODE) is\
  \ highly flexible, allowing the user to simulate realistic genomic regions with\
  \ several loci evolving according to a variety of mutation models (from simple to\
  \ context-dependent), and allows for insertions and deletions. Each locus can be\
  \ annotated as either coding or non-coding, sex-linked or autosomal, selected or\
  \ neutral, and have an arbitrary linkage structure (from completely linked to independent).\
