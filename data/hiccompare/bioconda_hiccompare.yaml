description: HiCcompare provides functions for joint normalization and difference
  detection in multiple Hi-C datasets. HiCcompare operates on processed Hi-C data
  in the form of chromosome-specific chromatin interaction matrices. It accepts three-column
  tab-separated text files storing chromatin interaction matrices in a sparse matrix
  format which are available from several sources. HiCcompare is designed to give
  the user the ability to perform a comparative analysis on the 3-Dimensional structure
  of the genomes of cells in different biological states.`HiCcompare` differs from
  other packages that attempt to compare Hi-C data in that it works on processed data
  in chromatin interaction matrix format instead of pre-processed sequencing data.
  In addition, `HiCcompare` provides a non-parametric method for the joint normalization
  and removal of biases between two Hi-C datasets for the purpose of comparative analysis.
  `HiCcompare` also provides a simple yet robust method for detecting differences
  between Hi-C datasets.
