  "sc:description": "CBA (Consistency Based Alignment) builds multiple structure alignments from pairwise superpositions using consistency as a driving force.The software harnesses the information contained within regions that are consistently aligned among a set of pairwise superpositions in order to realign pairs of proteins through both global and local refinement methods. It then constructs a multiple alignment that is maximally consistent with the improved pairwise alignments.",
