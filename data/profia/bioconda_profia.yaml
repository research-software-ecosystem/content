description: Flow Injection Analysis coupled to High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry
  is a promising approach for high-throughput metabolomics. FIA- HRMS data, however,
  cannot be pre-processed with current software tools which rely on liquid chromatography
  separation, or handle low resolution data only. Here we present the proFIA package,
  which implements a new methodology to pre-process FIA-HRMS raw data (netCDF, mzData,
  mzXML, and mzML) including noise modelling and injection peak reconstruction, and
  generate the peak table. The workflow includes noise modelling, band detection and
  filtering then signal matching and missing value imputation. The peak table can
  then be exported as a .tsv file for further analysis. Visualisations to assess the
  quality of the data and of the signal made are easely produced.
