It is also possible to define canonical (average or sequence-adapted) nucleic acid structures using a variety of predefined internal libraries, as well to create specific nucleic acid conformations from the sequence. The server offers a variety of methods to explore nucleic acid flexibility, such as a colorless wormlike-chain model, a base-pair resolution mesoscopic model and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations with a wide variety of protocols and force fields. The trajectories obtained by simulations, or imported externally, can be visualized and analyzed using a large number of tools, including standard Cartesian analysis, essential dynamics, helical analysis, local and global stiffness, energy decomposition, principal components and in silico NMR spectra. The server is accessible free of charge from the mmb.irbbarcelona.org/NAFlex webpage.",

                "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulation (MD) is, just behind genomics, the bioinformatics tool that generates the largest amounts of data, and that is using the largest amount of CPU time in supercomputing centres. MD trajectories are obtained after months of calculations, analysed in situ, and in practice forgotten. Several projects to generate stable trajectory databases have been developed for proteins, but no equivalence exists in the nucleic acids world. We present here a novel database system to store MD trajectories and analyses of nucleic acids. The initial data set available consists mainly of the benchmark of the new molecular dynamics force-field, parmBSC1. It contains 156 simulations, with over 120 μs of total simulation time. A deposition protocol is available to accept the submission of new trajectory data. The database is based on the combination of two NoSQL engines, Cassandra for storing trajectories and MongoDB to store analysis results and simulation metadata. The analyses available include backbone geometries, helical analysis, NMR observables and a variety of mechanical analyses. Individual trajectories and combined meta-trajectories can be downloaded from the portal. The system is accessible through http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/BIGNASim/. Supplementary Material is also available on-line at http://mmb. irbbarcelona.org/BIGNASim/SuppMaterial/.",

In addition, our server also surveys other protein and genomic databases allowing the user to combine and explore the physical properties of selected DNA in the context of functional features annotated on those regions. © The Author 2008.

The server incorporates powerful protocols for the coarse-grained determination of protein dynamics using different versions of Normal Mode Analysis (NMA), Brownian dynamics (BD) and Discrete Dynamics (DMD). It can also analyze user provided trajectories. The server allows a complete analysis of flexibility using a large variety of metrics, including basic geometrical analysis, B-factors, essential dynamics, stiffness analysis, collectivity measures, Lindemann's indexes, residue correlation, chain-correlations, dynamic domain determination, hinge point detections, etc. Data is presented through a web interface as plain text, 2D and 3D graphics. © The Author 2009.

                "abstract": "Motivation: A new algorithm to trace conformational transitions in proteins is presented. The method uses discrete molecular dynamics as engine to sample protein conformational space. A multiple minima Go-like potential energy function is used in combination with several enhancing sampling strategies, such as metadynamics, Maxwell Demon molecular dynamics and essential dynamics. The method, which shows an unprecedented computational efficiency, is able to trace a wide range of known experimental transitions. Contrary to simpler methods our strategy does not introduce distortions in the chemical structure of the protein and is able to reproduce well complex non-linear conformational transitions. The method, called GOdMD, can easily introduce additional restraints to the transition (presence of ligand, known intermediate, known maintained contacts, ...) and is freely distributed to the community through the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/GOdMD).Availability: Freely available on the web at http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/GOdMD.Contact: or modesto@mmb.pcb.ub.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. © 2013 The Author 2013.
