Molecular dynamics simulation (MD) is, just behind genomics, the bioinformatics tool that generates the largest amounts of data, and that is using the largest amount of CPU time in supercomputing centres. MD trajectories are obtained after months of calculations, analysed in situ, and in practice forgotten. Several projects to generate stable trajectory databases have been developed for proteins, but no equivalence exists in the nucleic acids world. We present here a novel database system to store MD trajectories and analyses of nucleic acids. The initial data set available consists mainly of the benchmark of the new molecular dynamics force-field, parmBSC1. It contains 156 simulations, with over 120 μs of total simulation time. A deposition protocol is available to accept the submission of new trajectory data. The database is based on the combination of two NoSQL engines, Cassandra for storing trajectories and MongoDB to store analysis results and simulation metadata. The analyses available include backbone geometries, helical analysis, NMR observables and a variety of mechanical analyses. Individual trajectories and combined meta-trajectories can be downloaded from the portal. The system is accessible through http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/BIGNASim/.

The method uses discrete molecular dynamics as engine to sample protein conformational space. A multiple minima Go-like potential energy function is used in combination with several enhancing sampling strategies, such as metadynamics, Maxwell Demon molecular dynamics and essential dynamics. The method, which shows an unprecedented computational efficiency, is able to trace a wide range of known experimental transitions. Contrary to simpler methods our strategy does not introduce distortions in the chemical structure of the protein and is able to reproduce well complex non-linear conformational transitions. The method, called GOdMD, can easily introduce additional restraints to the transition (presence of ligand, known intermediate, known maintained contacts, ...) and is freely distributed to the community through the Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute (http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/GOdMD).Availability: Freely available on the web at http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/GOdMD.Contact: or modesto@mmb.pcb.ub.esSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online. © 2013 The Author 2013.

SEABED goes beyond the basic docking and QSAR web tools and implements extended functionalities like receptor preparation, library editing, flexible ensemble docking, hybrid docking/QSAR experiments or virtual screening on protein mutants. SEABED is not a monolithic workflow tool but Software as a Service platform.",

The web server implements a wide repertoire of metrics to derive physical information from DNA sequences with a powerful interface to derive 3D information on large sequences of both naked and protein-bound DNAs. Furthermore, it implements a mesoscopic Metropolis code which allows the inexpensive study of the dynamic properties of chromatin fibers. In addition, our server also surveys other protein and genomic databases allowing the user to combine and explore the physical properties of selected DNA in the context of functional features annotated on those regions. © The Author 2008.
