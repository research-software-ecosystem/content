The algorithm takes into account the chemical formula and the spatial distribution to determine which ions are matrix-related. The algorithm incorporates an overlapping peak detection feature to prevent misclassification of overlapped or isobaric ions. Additionally, the package generates a visual report to transparently justify each annotation","homepage":"https://github.com/gbaquer/rMSIcleanup","name":"rMSIcleanup"}}
