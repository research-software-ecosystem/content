description: The synapter package provides functionality to reanalyse label-free proteomics
  data acquired on a Synapt G2 mass spectrometer. One or several runs, possibly processed
  with additional ion mobility separation to increase identification accuracy can
  be combined to other quantitation files to maximise identification and quantitation
  accuracy.
