This extraordinary analytical power of NGS can be harnessed for the analysis of in vitro experiments where DNA template sequence dependence of protein activity acting on DNA can be studied in a single reaction for thousands of DNA sequence variants. This allows a rapid accumulation of data on DNA sequence dependence of the process of interest to a depth not accessible by standard experimentation. We use an example of bacterial RNA polymerase promoter melting activity to describe the NGS-based methodology to study DNA template dependence of protein activity.","authors":["Heyduk T.","Heyduk E."],"cit_count":2,"doi":"10.1016/j.ymeth.2015.04.030","journal":"Methods","title":"Next Generation Sequencing-based analysis of RNA polymerase functions","type":"Other","year":"2015-01-01"},{"abstract":"© The Author(s) 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.High-throughput data production technologies, particularly 'next-generation' DNA sequencing, have ushered in widespread and disruptive changes to biomedical research. Making sense of the large datasets produced by these technologies requires sophisticated statistical and computational methods, as well as substantial computational power. This has led to an acute crisis in life sciences, as researchers without informatics training attempt to perform computation-dependent analyses. Since 2005, the Galaxy project has worked to address this problem by providing a framework that makes advanced computational tools usable by non experts. Galaxy seeks to make data-intensive research more accessible, transparent and reproducible by providing a Web-based environment in which users can perform computational analyses and have all of the details automatically tracked for later inspection, publication, or reuse. In this report we highlight recently added features enabling biomedical analyses on a large scale.","authors":["Afgan E.","Baker D.","van den Beek M.","Blankenberg D.","Bouvier D.","Cech M.","Chilton J.","Clements D.","Coraor N.","Eberhard C.","Gruning B.","Guerler A.","Hillman-Jackson J.","Von Kuster G.","Rasche E.","Soranzo N.","Turaga N.","Taylor J.","Nekrutenko A.","Goecks J."],"cit_count":523,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkw343","journal":"Nucleic acids research","title":"The Galaxy platform for accessible, reproducible and collaborative biomedical analyses: 2016 update","type":"Other","year":"2016-07-08"},{"doi":"10.7490/f1000research.1114334.1","type":"Other"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cshl_princeton_fastx_barcode_splitter-ip","biotoolsID":"cshl_princeton_fastx_barcode_splitter","description":"Split a FASTQ or FASTA file into several files, using barcodes as the split criteria.","homepage":"http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/","name":"cshl_princeton_fastx_barcode_splitter","version":["1.1"]}}
