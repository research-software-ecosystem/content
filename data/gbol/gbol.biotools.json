                "abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).The RDF data model facilitates integration of diverse data available in structured and semi-structured formats. To obtain a coherent RDF graph the chosen ontology must be consistently applied. However, addition of new diverse data causes the ontology to evolve, which could lead to accumulation of unintended erroneous composites. Thus, there is a need for a gate keeping system that compares the intended content described in the ontology with the actual content of the resource. The Empusa code generator facilitates creation of composite RDF resources from disparate sources. Empusa can convert a schema into an associated application programming interface (API), that can be used to perform data consistency checks and generates Markdown documentation to make persistent URLs resolvable. Using Empusa consistency is ensured within and between the ontology and the content of the resource. As an illustration of the potential of Empusa, we present the Genome Biology Ontology Language (GBOL). GBOL uses and extends current ontologies to provide a formal representation of genomic entities, along with their properties, relations and provenance.",
