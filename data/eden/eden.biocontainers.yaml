description: The Explicit Decomposition with Neighborhoods (EDeN) is a decompositional
  kernel based on the Neighborhood Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK) that
  can be used to induce an explicit feature representation for graphs. This in turn
  allows the adoption of machine learning algorithm to perform supervised and unsupervised
  learning task in a scalable way (e.g. using fast stochastic gradient descent methods
  in classification and approximate neighborhood queries in clustering).
