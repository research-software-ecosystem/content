  "sc:description": "Simple tool based on the iterative mapping of sequence reads at contig edges, capable to extend the genomic contigs deriving from high-throughput sequencing, especially those deriving by Newbler-like assemblies. Testing it on a set of de novo draft genomes led to the closure of up to 20% of the gaps originally present. It is cross-platform and most of the steps of its pipeline are parallelizable, making easy and fast to improve a draft genome resulting from a de novo assembly.",
