Effective application of signaling kinetics to developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a new analysis framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics",
