  "sc:description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'arrestin', 'agonism', 'arrestin recruitment', 'kinetic' | A new kinetic method for measuring agonist efficacy and ligand bias using high resolution biosensors and a kinetic data analysis framework | ABSTRACT The kinetics dynamics of signaling are of increasing value for G-protein-coupled receptor therapeutic development, including spatiotemporal signaling and the kinetic context of biased agonism. Effective application of signaling kinetics to developing new therapeutics requires reliable kinetic assays and an analysis framework to extract kinetic pharmacological parameters. Here we describe a platform for measuring arrestin recruitment kinetics to GPCRs using a high quantum yield, genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor, and a new analysis framework to quantify the recruitment kinetics",
