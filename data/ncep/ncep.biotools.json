                "abstract": "\u00a9 2020 Elsevier LtdNoncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as lncRNAs, circRNAs and pri-miRNAs, play important roles in physiological and pathological processes. Recently, it was demonstrated that they could encode proteins or peptides. However, relevant information is scattered across numerous published articles, which is inconvenient for the exploration of ncRNA translation by researchers. In this study, we presented an ncEP database, which records the low-throughput experimentally validated (LTEV) proteins or peptides encoded by ncRNAs, from published articles. Collectively, ncEP contains 80 entries including 74 proteins or peptides, 22 lncRNAs, 11 circRNAs, 9 pri-miRNAs and 37 other ncRNAs across 18 species from more than 50 articles of over 2000 candidate articles. We have provided a user-friendly interface for users to search, browse, visualize, download and submit data. In summary, ncEP provides a relatively comprehensive repository of the LTEV proteins or peptides encoded by ncRNAs and will enrich the knowledge for translation process. ncEP is freely available at http://www.jianglab.cn/ncEP/.",
