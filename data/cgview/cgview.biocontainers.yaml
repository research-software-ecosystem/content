description: The cgview server generates graphical maps of circular genomes that can
  be used to visualize sequence conservation in the context of sequence features,
  imported analysis results, open reading frames and base composition plots. the server
  uses blast to compare the primary sequence of up to three genomes or sequence sets,
  aiding in the identification of conserved genome segments, instances of horizontal
  transfer or visualization of genome segments from newly obtained sequence reads.
