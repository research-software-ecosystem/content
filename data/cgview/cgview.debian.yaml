summary: Circular Genome Viewer
description: >
   CGView is a Java package for generating high quality, zoomable maps of
   circular genomes. Its primary purpose is to serve as a component of
   sequence annotation pipelines, as a means of generating visual output
   suitable for the web. Feature information and rendering options are
   supplied to the program using an XML file, a tab delimited file, or an
   NCBI ptt file. CGView converts the input into a graphical map (PNG, JPG,
   or Scalable Vector Graphics format), complete with labels, a title,
   legends, and footnotes. In addition to the default full view map, the
   program can generate a series of hyperlinked maps showing expanded
   views. The linked maps can be explored using any web browser, allowing
   rapid genome browsing, and facilitating data sharing. The feature labels
   in maps can be hyperlinked to external resources, allowing CGView maps
   to be integrated with existing web site content or databases.
   .
   In addition to the CGView application, an API is available for
   generating maps from within other Java applications, using the
   cgview package.
   .
   CGView can be used for any of the following:
    * Bacterial genome visualization and browsing - CGView can be
      incorporated into bacterial genome annotation pipelines, as a means
      of generating web content for data visualization and navigation. The
      PNG and image map content does not require Java applets or special
      browser plugins.
    * Genome poster generation - CGView can generate poster-sized images of
      circular genomes in rasterized image formats or in Scalable Vector
      Graphics format.
    * Sequence analysis visualization - CGView can be used to display the
      output of sequence analysis programs in a circular context.
   .
   CGView features:
    * Images can be generated in PNG, JPG, or SVG format. See the
      CGView gallery.
    * Static or interactive maps can be generated. The interactive maps
      make use of standard PNG images and HTML image maps. Scalable Vector
      Graphics output is included in the interactive maps (see example).
    * The XML input allows complete control over the appearance of the map.
    * Tab delimited input files and NCBI ptt files can be used as an
      alternative to the XML format.
    * The CGView API can be used to incorporate CGView into Java
      applications.
    * The CGView applet can be used to incorporate zoomable maps into web
      pages (see example).
    * The CGView Server can be used to generate maps online.
