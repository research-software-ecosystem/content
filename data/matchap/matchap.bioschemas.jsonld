      "sc:description": "an ultra fast algorithm for solving the single individual haplotype assembly problem.\n\nAbstract Background Human genomes are diploid, which means they have two homologous copies of each chromosome and the assignment of heterozygous variants to each chromosome copy, the haplotype assembly problem, is of fundamental importance for medical and population genetics. While short reads from second generation sequencing platforms drastically limit haplotype reconstruction as the great majority of reads do not allow to link many variants together, novel long reads from third generation sequencing can span several variants along the genome allowing to infer much longer haplotype blocks",
