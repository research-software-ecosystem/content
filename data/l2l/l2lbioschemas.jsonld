Through an easy-to-use web interface, L2L will mine a list of up- or down-regulated genes for Gene Ontology terms that are significantly enriched. L2L can also compare the list of genes to a database of hundreds of published microarray experiments, in order to identify common patterns of gene regulation. A downloadable command-line version can run customized and batch analyses.",
