Their stability, specificity, and high solubility allow the successful development and commercialization of antibody-based drugs. Though with these characteristics, mAbs projects are often suspended due to self- or cross-interaction of monoclonal antibodies. This is one of the main reasons which causes the development of mAbs into drugs taking forever and expensive. CISI is short for cross-interaction or self-interaction of mAbs. It can be quantified by several assays. The assays such as poly-specificity reagent and cross-interaction chromatography can measure cross-interaction of mAbs. Self-interaction can be assayed through clone self-interaction by biolayer interferometry and affinity-capture self-interaction nanoparticle spectroscopy. To save time and money, we developed a model called CISI which can predict cross-interaction or self-interaction based on tripeptide composition. It showed 88.20% accuracy, 90.22% sensitivity, 86.05% specificity, 0.78 Mathew correlation coefficient, and 0.96 area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in the leave-one-out cross-validation.
