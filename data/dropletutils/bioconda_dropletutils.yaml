description: Provides a number of utility functions for handling single-cell (RNA-seq)
  data from droplet technologies such as 10X Genomics. This includes data loading
  from count matrices or molecule information files, identification of cells from
  empty droplets, removal of barcode-swapped pseudo-cells, and downsampling of the
  count matrix.
