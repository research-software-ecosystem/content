To deal with such a challenging problem, the ensemble classifier was introduced. It was formed by a set of basic classifiers, with each trained in different parameter systems, such as predicted secondary structure, hydrophobicity, van der Waals volume, polarity, polarizability, as well as different dimensions of pseudo-amino acid composition, which were extracted from a training dataset. The operation engine for the constituent individual classifiers was OET-KNN (optimized evidence-theoretic k -nearest neighbors) rule. Their outcomes were combined through a weighted voting to give a final determination for classifying a query protein. The recognition was to find the true fold among the 27 possible patterns. Results: The overall success rate thus obtained was 62% for a testing dataset where most of the proteins have <25% sequence identity with the proteins used in training the classifier. Such a rate is 6-21% higher than the corresponding rates obtained by various existing NN (neural networks) and SVM (support vector machines) approaches, implying that the ensemble classifier is very promising and might become a useful vehicle in protein science, as well as proteomics and bioinformatics. \u00a9 2006 Oxford University Press.", "citationCount": 282, "authors": [{"name": "Shen H.-B."}, {"name": "Chou K.-C."}], "date": "2006-07-15T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:pfp-pred", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": ["2.0"], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/PFP-Pred/", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein fold prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0303"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Prediction", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Protein sequence analysis", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2479"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}, {"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Recognition", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2423"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:58Z", "otherID": [], "description": "PFP-Pred is an ensemble classifier for protein fold pattern recognition", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": [], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/pfp-pred-protein-fold-prediction.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "pfp-pred", "additionDate": "2017-12-18T00:10:18Z", "name": "PFP-Pred", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/PFP-Pred/Readme.htm", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
