description: Large data files can be difficult to work with in R, where data generally
  resides in memory. This package encourages a style of programming where data is
  'streamed' from disk into R via a `producer' and through a series of `consumers'
  that, typically reduce the original data to a manageable size. The package provides
  useful Producer and Consumer stream components for operations such as data input,
  sampling, indexing, and transformation; see package?Streamer for details.
