        "description": "a wisdom of the crowd-based Gene Ontology annotation tool | Abstract Motivation Protein function prediction tools vary widely in their methodologies, resulting in different sets of GO terms being correctly predicted. Ideally, multiple tools are combined to achieve a higher recall of GO terms while increasing precision. Results CrowdGO combines input predictions from any number of tools and combines them based on the Gene Ontology Directed Acyclic Graph. Using each GO terms information content, the semantic similarity between GO predictions of different tools, and a Support Vector Machine model, it achieves improved precision and recall compared to each of the tools separately (Figure 1).
