                "abstract": "Transcription factors play important roles in regulating biological and disease processes. Microarray technology has enabled researchers to simultaneously monitor changes in the expression of thousands of transcripts. By identifying specific transcription factor binding sites in the cis-regulatory regions of differentially expressed genes, it is then possible to identify direct targets of transcription factors, model transcriptional regulatory networks and mine the dataset for relevant targets for experimental and clinical manipulation. We have developed web-based software to assist biologists in efficiently carrying out the analysis of microarray data from studies of specific transcription factors. Batch Extraction and Analysis of cis-Regulatory Regions, or BEARR, accepts gene identifier lists from microarray data analysis tools and facilitates identification, extraction and analysis of regulatory regions from the large amount of data that is typically generated in these types of studies. The software is publicly available at http://giscompute.gis.a-star.edu.sg/~vega/BEARR1.0/. \u00a9 Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
