      "sc:description": "An integrated computational pipeline to infer functional effects of microbiome-host interactions.\n\nAbstract Microbiome-host interactions are important to nearly all living organisms, and play important roles in health and disease. Understanding these inter-kingdom cross-talks has a huge potential to advance diverse scientific domains such as the clinical and medical sciences, agriculture, and ecology. Detecting such interactions by experimental techniques remain challenging from a cost and feasibility perspective thus hampering large-scale analyses. Computational approaches not only make the inference of microbiome-host interactions viable but also scalable. Here, we present MicrobioLink, a computational pipeline to integrate predicted interactions between microbial and host proteins with host molecular networks.",
