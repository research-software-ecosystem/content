biotools_id: biomformat
description: This is an R package for interfacing with the BIOM format. This package
  includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing and subsetting data
  tables from a biom object (which is more complex than a single table), as well as
  limited support for writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design
  of this API is intended to match the python API and other tools included with the
  biom-format project, but with a decidedly "R flavor" that should be familiar to
  R users. This includes S4 classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core
  functions/methods.
