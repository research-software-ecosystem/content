  "sc:description": "This package includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing and subsetting data tables from a biom object, as well as limited support for writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design of this API is intended to match the python API and other tools included with the biom-format project, but with a decidedly \"R flavor\" that should be familiar to R users. This includes S4 classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core functions/methods.",
