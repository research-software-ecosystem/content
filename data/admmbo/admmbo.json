    "description": "Bayesian Optimization with Unknown Constraints using ADMM.\n\nThere exist many problems in science and engineering that involve optimization of an unknown or partially unknown objective function. Recently, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has emerged as a powerful tool for solving optimization problems whose objective functions are only available as a black box and are expensive to evaluate. Many practical problems, however, involve optimization of an unknown objective function subject to unknown constraints. This is an important yet challenging problem for which, unlike optimizing an unknown function, existing methods face several limitations. In this paper, we present a novel constrained Bayesian optimization framework to optimize an unknown objective function subject to unknown constraints.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ADMM', 'BO', 'ADMM-Bayesian'",
