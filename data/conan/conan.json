We thus propose a tool called CONtact ANalysis (CONAN) that, from molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories, analyzes interresidue contacts, creates videos of time-resolved contact maps, and performs correlation, principal component, and cluster analysis, revealing how specific contacts relate to functionally relevant states sampled by MD. We present how CONAN can identify features describing the dynamics of ubiquitin both at equilibrium and during mechanical unfolding. Additionally, we show the analysis of MD trajectories of an \u03b1-synuclein mutant peptide that undergoes an \u03b1-\u03b2 conformational transition that can be easily monitored using CONAN, which identifies the multiple states that the peptide explores along its conformational dynamics. The high versatility and ease of use of the software make CONAN a tool that can significantly facilitate the understanding of the complex dynamical behavior of proteins or other biomolecules. CONAN and its documentation are freely available for download on GitHub.", "citationCount": 3, "authors": [{"name": "Mercadante D."}, {"name": "Grater F."}, {"name": "Daday C."}], "date": "2018-03-27T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Biophysical Journal"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "Csaba Daday", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "csaba.daday@h-its.org"}, {"typeRole": [], "name": "Davide Mercadante", "url": null, "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6792-7706", "typeEntity": "Person", "email": null}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:conan", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "https://github.com/HITS-MBM/conan", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Molecular dynamics", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_2476"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2019-03-26T08:14:01Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Using molecular dynamics trajectories, analyzes inter-residue contacts, creates videos of time-resolved contact maps, and performs correlation, principal component, and cluster analysis, revealing how specific contacts relate to functionally relevant states sampled by molecular dynamics.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "group", "authors": ["proteomics.bio.tools"]}, "language": ["Python"], "link": [], "biotoolsID": "conan", "additionDate": "2018-08-05T06:05:41Z", "name": "CONAN", "license": "GPL-3.0", "documentation": [{"url": "https://github.com/HITS-MBM/conan/blob/master/README.md", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux", "Windows", "Mac"]}
