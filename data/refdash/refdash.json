    "description": "> HOMEPAGE BROKEN! | > CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'bReFDash' | </b>A <strong>Re</strong>pository of <strong>F</strong>unctional <strong>Dash</strong>boards providing comprehensive functional insights inferred from 16S microbiome data sets | Motivation: 16S rRNA gene amplicon based sequencing has significantly expanded the scope of metagenomics research by enabling microbial community analyses in a cost-effective manner. The possibility to infer functional potential of a microbiome through amplicon sequencing derived taxonomic abundance profiles has further strengthened the utility of 16S sequencing. In fact, a surge in 'inferred function metagenomic analysis' has recently taken place, wherein most 16S microbiome studies include inferred functional insights in addition to taxonomic characterization. Tools like PICRUSt, Tax4Fun, Vikodak and iVikodak have significantly eased the process of inferring function potential of a microbiome using the taxonomic abundance profile",
