In last years we assisted to an increase of natural disasters, also due to climate change. Many works showed that during such events people tend to share specific messages by of mean of social media platforms, especially Twitter. Not only they contribute to\"situational\" awareness also improving the dissemination of information during emergency but can be used to assess social impact of crisis events. We present in this work preliminary findings concerning how temporal distribution of weather related messages may help the identification of severe events that impacted a community.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE BROKEN!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'DISIT-Twitter Vigilance', 'weather', 'Weather events identification social media streams', 'parallel-wise'","homepage":"http://www.disit.org/tv/","name":"DISIT-Twitter"}}
