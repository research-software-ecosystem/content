This is clearly not the most efficient way of extracting information. The main aim of this article is to develop a coherent statistical method that can simultaneously cluster and detect differentially expressed genes. Through information sharing between the two tasks, the proposed approach gives more sensible clustering among genes and is more sensitive in identifying differentially expressed genes. The improvement over existing methods is illustrated in both our simulation results and a case study. \u00a9 2006, The International Biometric Society.",
