EBI Search (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch) provides a full-text search engine across nearly 5 billion entries, while the Job Dispatcher tools framework (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services) enables the scientific community to perform a diverse range of sequence analysis using popular bioinformatics applications. Both allow users to interact through user-friendly web applications, as well as via RESTful and SOAP-based APIs. Here, we describe recent improvements to these services and updates made to accommodate the increasing data requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

                "abstract": "We present a new method for the identification of conserved patterns in a set of unaligned related protein sequences. It is able to discover patterns of a quite general form, allowing for both ambiguous positions and for variable length wildcard regions. It allows the user to define a class of patterns (e.g., the degree of ambiguity allowed and the length and number of gaps), and the method is then guaranteed to find the conserved patterns in this class scoring highest according to a significance measure defined. Identified patterns may be refined using one of two new algorithms. We present a new (nonstatistical) significance measure for flexible patterns. The method is shown to recover known motifs for PROSITE families and is also applied to some recently described families from the literature. Copyright © 1995 The Protein Society",
