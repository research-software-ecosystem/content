    "description": "An R package to explore and extract data from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) | Using dbgap2x, R package to explore, download and decrypt phenotypic and genomic data from dbGaP | On dbGaP, the phenotypic files are encrypted. We created a decryption function that uses a dockerized version on sratoolkit. To use that function, you need to have docker installed on your device (www.docker.com). If you are using the dockerized version of this software (available at hub.docker.com/r/gversmee/dbgap2x), docker is already pre-installed, but you'll need to upload your key on the jupyter working directory",

All rights reserved.Based on the Genomic Data Sharing Policy issued in August 2007, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has supported several repositories such as the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). dbGaP is an online repository that provides access to large-scale genetic and phenotypic datasets with more than 1000 studies. However, navigating the website and understanding the relationship between the studies are not easy tasks. Moreover, the decryption of the files is a complex procedure. In this study we propose the dbgap2x R package that covers a broad range of functions for searching dbGaP studies, exploring the characteristics of a study and easily decrypting the files from dbGaP.",
