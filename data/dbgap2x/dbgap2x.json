    "description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'IMPLEMENTATION:dbgap2x' | An R package to explore and extract data from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) | Using dbgap2x, R package to explore, download and decrypt phenotypic and genomic data from dbGaP | On dbGaP, the phenotypic files are encrypted. We created a decryption function that uses a dockerized version on sratoolkit. To use that function, you need to have docker installed on your device (www.docker.com). If you are using the dockerized version of this software (available at hub.docker.com/r/gversmee/dbgap2x), docker is already pre-installed, but you'll need to upload your key on the jupyter working directory",
