All rights reserved.Responding to the recent interest of the yeast research community in non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae species of biotechnological relevance, the N.C.Yeastract (http://yeastract-plus.org/ncyeastract/) was associated to YEASTRACT + (http://yeastract-plus.org/). The YEASTRACT + portal is a curated repository of known regulatory associations between transcription factors (TFs) and target genes in yeasts. N.C.Yeastract gathers all published regulatory associations and TF-binding sites for Komagataella phaffii (formerly Pichia pastoris), the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, the lactose fermenting species Kluyveromyces lactis and Kluyveromyces marxianus, and the remarkably weak acid-tolerant food spoilage yeast Zygosaccharomyces bailii. The objective of this review paper is to advertise the update of the existing information since the release of N.C.Yeastract in 2019, and to raise awareness in the community about its potential to help the day-to-day work on these species, exploring all the information available in the global YEASTRACT + portal. Using simple and widely used examples, a guided exploitation is offered for several tools: (i) inference of orthologous genes; (ii) search for putative TF binding sites and (iii) inter-species comparison of transcription regulatory networks and prediction of TF-regulated networks based on documented regulatory associations available in YEASTRACT + for well-studied species. The usage potentialities of the new CommunityYeastract platform by the yeast community are also discussed",
