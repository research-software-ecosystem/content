All rights reserved.Molecular viewers' long learning curve is hindering researchers in approaching the field of structural biology for the first time. Herein, we present 'The Protein Imager', a lightweight, powerful and easy-to-use interface as a next-gen online molecular viewer. Furthermore, the interface is linked to an automated server-side rendering system able to generate publication-quality molecular illustrations. The Protein Imager interface has been designed for easy usage for beginners and experts in the field alike. The interface allows the preparation of very complex molecular views maintaining a high level of responsiveness even on mobile devices.",
