PEPPAN implements a combination of tree- and synteny-based approaches to identify and exclude paralogous genes, as well as similarity-based gene predictions that support consistent annotations of genes and pseudogenes in individual genomes.\n\nThere are two final output files for PEPPAN:.\n\nThis file includes all pan-genes predicted by PEPPAN in GFF3 format. Intact CDSs are labeled as \"CDS\", disrupted genes (potential pseudogenes) are labeled as \"pseudogene\" and suspicious annotations ignored in the pipeline are labeled as \"misc_feature\" entries.",
