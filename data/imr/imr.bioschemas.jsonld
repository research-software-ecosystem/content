      "sc:description": "> VERY_LOW CONFIDENCE! | > HOMEPAGE MISSING! | Implementing illness management and recovery within assertive community treatment teams | OBJECTIVE:The study purpose was to assess the feasibility, advantages disadvantages, and factors that hinder or facilitate the implementation of illness management and recovery (IMR) within assertive community treatment (ACT) teams. METHOD:A qualitative study was conducted with 11 ACT teams that implemented IMR. We conducted semistructured individual interviews with 17 persons enrolled in services and 55 ACT staff in individual and focus groups. Questions were designed to assess perceptions of IMR implementation, effects of IMR, staff training considerations, and recommendations. Data were analyzed using an inductive, consensus-building, thematic analysis, which included multiple research staff reviewing interview transcripts and field notes, developing and refining a codebook, constructing data summaries, and thematic synthesis",
