description: 'The package provides an integrated pipeline for the analysis of PAR-CLIP
  data. PAR-CLIP-induced transitions are first discriminated from sequencing errors,
  SNPs and additional non-experimental sources by a non- parametric mixture model.
  The protein binding sites (clusters) are then resolved at high resolution and cluster
  statistics are estimated using a rigorous Bayesian framework. Post-processing of
  the results, data export for UCSC genome browser visualization and motif search
  analysis are provided. In addition, the package allows to integrate RNA-Seq data
  to estimate the False Discovery Rate of cluster detection. Key functions support
  parallel multicore computing. Note: while wavClusteR was designed for PAR-CLIP data
  analysis, it can be applied to the analysis of other NGS data obtained from experimental
  procedures that induce nucleotide substitutions (e.g. BisSeq).'
