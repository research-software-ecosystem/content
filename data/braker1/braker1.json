Published by Oxford University Press. Motivation: Gene finding in eukaryotic genomes is notoriously difficult to automate. The task is to design a work flow with a minimal set of tools that would reach state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of species. GeneMark-ET is a gene prediction tool that incorporates RNA-Seq data into unsupervised training and subsequently generates ab initio gene predictions. AUGUSTUS is a gene finder that usually requires supervised training and uses information from RNA-Seq reads in the prediction step. Complementary strengths of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS provided motivation for designing a new combined tool for automatic gene prediction. Results: We present BRAKER1, a pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation that combines the advantages of GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS. As input, BRAKER1 requires a genome assembly file and a file in bam-format with spliced alignments of RNA-Seq reads to the genome. First, GeneMark-ET performs iterative training and generates initial gene structures. Second, AUGUSTUS uses predicted genes for training and then integrates RNA-Seq read information into final gene predictions. In our experiments, we observed that BRAKER1 was more accurate than MAKER2 when it is using RNA-Seq as sole source for training and prediction. BRAKER1 does not require pre-trained parameters or a separate expert-prepared training step.", "citationCount": 113, "authors": [{"name": "Hoff K.J."}, {"name": "Lange S."}, {"name": "Lomsadze A."}, {"name": "Borodovsky M."}, {"name": "Stanke M."}], "date": "2015-05-08T00:00:00Z", "journal": "Bioinformatics"}}], "homepage_status": 0, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": null, "url": "http://www.gatech.edu/", "gridid": null, "note": null, "orcidid": null, "typeEntity": "Person", "email": "bioinformatik.greifswald@gmail.com"}], "biotoolsCURIE": "biotools:braker1", "elixirPlatform": [], "elixirNode": [], "version": [], "elixir_badge": 0, "homepage": "http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/braker/index.html", "function": [{"note": null, "input": [], "operation": [{"term": "Genome annotation", "uri": "http://edamontology.org/operation_0362"}], "cmd": null, "output": []}], "lastUpdate": "2018-12-10T12:58:56Z", "otherID": [], "description": "Pipeline for unsupervised RNA-Seq-based genome annotation with GeneMark-ET and AUGUSTUS.", "toolType": ["Command-line tool"], "editPermission": {"type": "private", "authors": []}, "language": ["Perl"], "link": [{"url": "http://www.mybiosoftware.com/braker1-rna-seq-based-eukaryotic-genome-annotation-pipeline.html", "note": null, "type": "Software catalogue"}], "biotoolsID": "braker1", "additionDate": "2017-08-03T18:37:08Z", "name": "BRAKER1", "license": null, "documentation": [{"url": "http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/braker/index.html", "note": null, "type": "General"}], "maturity": null, "confidence_flag": null, "operatingSystem": ["Linux"]}
