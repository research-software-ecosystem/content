description: Genomic DNA controls the behaviour of biological cells. Understanding
  it, and its variations, facilitates the molecular pathology of diseases. braker.pl
  can either run with a genome sequence, only; or with additional alignments for short
  transcriptome reads against the genome; or with additional protein sequences of
  closely related species; or with evidence from the alignment of protein sequences
  of distantly related species. The package provides the means to interpret genomic
  sequences in FASTA format from fungi, plants and animals.
