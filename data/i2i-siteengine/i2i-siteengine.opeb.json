The FlexProt method performs flexible structural alignment of protein molecules. FlexProt simultaneously detects the hinge regions and aligns the rigid subparts of the molecules. It does not require an a priori knowledge of the flexible hinge regions. MultiProt and MASS perform simultaneous comparison of multiple protein structures. PatchDock performs prediction of protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. The input to all services is either protein PDB codes or protein structures uploaded to the server.

Here we present two web servers and software packages for recognition of the similarity of binding sites and interfaces. Both methods recognize local geometrical and physicochemical similarity, which can be present even in the absence of overall sequence or fold similarity. The first method, SiteEngine (http:/bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/SiteEngine), receives as an input two protein structures and searches the complete surface of one protein for regions similar to the binding site of the other. The second, Interface-to-Interface (I2I)-SiteEngine (http:/ bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/I2I-SiteEngine), compares protein-protein interfaces, which are regions of interaction between two protein molecules. It receives as an input two structures of protein-protein complexes, extracts the interfaces and finds the three-dimensional transformation that maximizes the similarity between two pairs of interacting binding sites. The output of both servers consists of a superimposition in PDB file format and a list of physicochemical properties shared by the compared entities. The methods are highly efficient and the freely available software packages are suitable for large-scale database searches of the entire PDB. © 2005 Oxford University Press.","authors":["Shulman-Peleg A.","Nussinov R.","Wolfson H.J."],"cit_count":63,"journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","pmid":"15980484","title":"SiteEngines: Recognition and comparison of binding sites and protein-protein interfaces","year":"2005-07-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:i2i-siteengine","biotoolsID":"i2i-siteengine","description":"Interface-to-Interface (I2I)-SiteEngine compares pairs of interacting protein binding sites by recognizing similarity of physico-chemical properties and shapes in the protein-protein interfaces.","homepage":"http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/I2I-SiteEngine/","name":"I2I-SiteEngine"}}
