    "description": "> CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'CONCLUSIONS:IRESpy' | an XGBoost model for prediction of internal ribosome entry sites | BACKGROUND:Internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) are segments of mRNA found in untranslated regions that can recruit the ribosome and initiate translation independently of the 5' cap-dependent translation initiation mechanism. IRES usually function when 5' cap-dependent translation initiation has been blocked or repressed. They have been widely found to play important roles in viral infections and cellular processes. However, a limited number of confirmed IRES have been reported due to the requirement for highly labor intensive, slow, and low efficiency laboratory experiments. Bioinformatics tools have been developed, but there is no reliable online tool. RESULTS:This paper systematically examines the features that can distinguish IRES from non-IRES sequences",
