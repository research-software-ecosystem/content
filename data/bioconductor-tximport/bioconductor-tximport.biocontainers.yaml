description: Imports transcript-level abundance, estimated counts and transcript lengths,
  and summarizes into matrices for use with downstream gene-level analysis packages.
  average transcript length, weighted by sample-specific transcript abundance estimates,
  is provided as a matrix which can be used as an offset for different expression
  of gene-level counts.
