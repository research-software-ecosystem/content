These UIA and SAH CDEs will join other neurological disease-specific CDEs already developed and available for use by research investigators. Methods: The eight LTT WG members comprised international UIA, and SAH experts reviewed existing NINDS CDEs and instruments, created new elements when needed, and provided recommendations for future LTT clinical research. The recommendations were compiled, internally reviewed by the all UIA and SAH WGs and steering committee members. The NINDS CDE team also reviewed the final version before posting the SAH Version 1.0 CDE recommendations on the NINDS CDE website. Results: The NINDS UIA and SAH LTT CDEs and supporting documents are publicly available on the NINDS CDE (https://www.commondataelements.ninds.nih.gov/#page=Default) and NIH Repository (https://cde.nlm.nih.gov/home) websites. The subcommittee members discussed and reviewed various parameters, outcomes, and endpoints in UIA and SAH LTT studies. The following meetings with WG members, the LTT WG’s recommendations are incorporated into the disease/injury-related events, assessments and examinations, and treatment/intervention data domains. Conclusions: Noting gaps in the literature regarding medication and rehabilitation parameters in UIA and SAH clinical studies, the current CDE recommendations aim to arouse interest to explore the impact of medication and rehabilitation treatments and therapies and encourage the convergence of LTT clinical study parameters to develop a harmonized standard.",

The recommendations are organized into domains including Participant Characteristics and Outcomes and Endpoints. Conclusion: Dissemination and widespread use of CDEs can facilitate UIA and SAH clinical research and clinical trial design, data sharing, and analyses of observational retrospective and prospective data. It is vital to maintain an international and multidisciplinary collaboration to ensure that these CDEs are implemented and updated when new information becomes available.",
