    "description": "A Perinatal and Chronic Extended-Dose-Range Study of Bisphenol A in Rats.\n\nBisphenol A (BPA, CAS #80-05-7) is a high-production-volume industrial chemical used as a monomer for polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins that have broad applications in consumer products, including storage containers for foods and beverages and medical devices. The potential toxicity resulting from chronic exposure to BPA as an indirect food additive is the concern addressed in this study.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'ug BPA kg bw day', 'ug EE2 kg bw day', 'EE2 kg bw day dose', 'stop-dose males terminal stop-dose BPA'",
