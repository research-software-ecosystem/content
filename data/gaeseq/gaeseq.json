    "description": "A Graph Auto-Encoder for Haplotype Assembly and Viral Quasispecies Reconstruction.\n\nAbstract Reconstructing components of a genomic mixture from data obtained by means of DNA sequencing is a challenging problem encountered in a variety of applications including single individual haplotyping and studies of viral communities. High-throughput DNA sequencing platforms oversample mixture components to provide massive amounts of reads whose relative positions can be determined by mapping the reads to a known reference genome; assembly of the components, however, requires discovery of the reads\u2019 origin an NP-hard problem that the existing methods struggle to solve with the required level of accuracy. In this paper, we present a learning framework based on a graph auto-encoder designed to exploit structural properties of sequencing data.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'auto-encoder', 'oversample', 'Quasispecies', 'struggle'",
