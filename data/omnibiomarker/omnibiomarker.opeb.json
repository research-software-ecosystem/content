Biomarker identification from high-throughput genomic expression data is difficult because of data properties (i.e., small-sample size compared to large-feature size) as well as the large number of available feature selection algorithms. Thus, it is unclear which algorithm should be used for a particular dataset. These factors lead to instability in biomarker identification and affect the reproducibility of results. We introduce a method for computing the biological relevance of feature selection algorithms using an externally validated knowledge base of manually curated cancer biomarkers. Results suggest that knowledge-driven biomarker identification can improve microarray-based clinical prediction performance. omniBiomarker can be accessed at http://omnibiomarker.bme.gatech.edu/. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","authors":["Phan J.H.","Young A.N.","Wang M.D."],"cit_count":6,"journal":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pmid":"22893372","title":"OmniBiomarker: A web-based application for knowledge-driven biomarker identification","year":"2013-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:omnibiomarker","biotoolsID":"omnibiomarker","description":"Web-based bioinformatics application that addresses the microarray “curse of dimensionality” problem as well as the software standards problem.","homepage":"http://omnibiomarker.bme.gatech.edu/","name":"omniBiomarker"}}
