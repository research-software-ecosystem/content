Biomarker identification from high-throughput genomic expression data is difficult because of data properties (i.e., small-sample size compared to large-feature size) as well as the large number of available feature selection algorithms. Thus, it is unclear which algorithm should be used for a particular dataset. These factors lead to instability in biomarker identification and affect the reproducibility of results. We introduce a method for computing the biological relevance of feature selection algorithms using an externally validated knowledge base of manually curated cancer biomarkers. Results suggest that knowledge-driven biomarker identification can improve microarray-based clinical prediction performance. omniBiomarker can be accessed at http://omnibiomarker.bme.gatech.edu/. \u00a9 1964-2012 IEEE.", "citationCount": 6, "authors": [{"name": "Phan J.H."}, {"name": "Young A.N."}, {"name": "Wang M.D."}], "date": "2013-12-01T00:00:00Z", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering"}}], "homepage_status": 1, "credit": [{"typeRole": ["Primary contact"], "name": "John H.
