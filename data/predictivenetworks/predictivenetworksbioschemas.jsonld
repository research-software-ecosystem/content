  "sc:description": "The regression-based network inference algorithm creates a graph of gene interactions in which cycles may be present (but no self-loops). Based on information-theoretic techniques, a causal gene interaction network is inferred from both prior knowledge (interactions extracted from biomedical literature and structured biological databases) and gene expression data. A prediction model is fitted for each gene, given its parents, enabling assessment of the predictive ability of the network model.",
