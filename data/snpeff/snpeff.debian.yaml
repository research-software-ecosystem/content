description: SnpEff is a variant annotation and effect prediction tool. It annotates
  and predicts the effects of variants on genes (such as amino acid changes). . The
  inputs are predicted variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions and MNPs). The input
  file is usually obtained as a result of a sequencing experiment, and it is usually
  in variant call format (VCF). . SnpEff analyzes the input variants. It annotates
  the variants and calculates the effects they produce on known genes (e.g. amino
  acid changes). A list of effects and annotations that SnpEff can calculate can be
  found here.
