Tested on somatic mutations, CScape tends to outperform alternative methods, reaching 91% balanced accuracy in coding regions and 70% in non-coding regions, while even higher accuracy may be achieved using thresholds to isolate high-confidence predictions. Positive predictions tend to cluster in genomic regions, so we apply a statistical approach to isolate coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome that appear enriched for high-confidence predicted disease-drivers.","authors":["Rogers M.F.","Shihab H.A.","Gaunt T.R.","Campbell C."],"cit_count":4,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-017-11746-4","journal":"Scientific Reports","title":"CScape: A tool for predicting oncogenic single-point mutations in the cancer genome","year":"2017-12-01"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:cscape","biotoolsID":"cscape","description":"Predicts the oncogenic status (disease-driver or neutral) of somatic point mutations in the coding and non-coding regions of the cancer genome.
