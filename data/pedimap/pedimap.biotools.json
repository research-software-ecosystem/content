                "abstract": "Pedimap is a user-friendly software tool for visualizing phenotypic and genotypic data for related individuals linked in pedigrees. Genetic data can include marker scores, Identity-by-Descent probabilities, and marker linkage map positions, allowing the visualization of haplotypes through lineages. The pedigrees can accommodate all types of inheritance, including selfing, cloning, and repeated backcrossing, and all ploidy levels are supported. Visual association of the genetic data with phenotypic data simplifies the exploration of large data sets, thereby improving breeding decision making. Data are imported from text files; in addition data exchange with other software packages (FlexQTLTM and GenomeStudioTM) is possible. Instructions for use and an executable version compatible with the Windows platform are available for free from http://www.plantbreeding.wur.nl/UK/software-pedimap. html. \u00a9 2012 The American Genetic Association. 2012.",
