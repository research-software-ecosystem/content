description: High throughput analysis of T cell antigen receptor sequences The genes
  encoding T cell receptors are created by somatic recombination, generating an immense
  combination of V, (D) and J segments. Additional processes during the recombination
  create extra sequence diversity between the V an J segments. Collectively, this
  hyper-variable region is called the CDR3 loop. The purpose of this package is to
  process and quantitatively analyse millions of V-CDR3-J combination, called clonotypes,
  from multiple sequence libraries.
