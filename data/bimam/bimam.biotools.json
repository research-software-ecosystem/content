    "description": "BIMAM (Bayesian IMputation and Analysis Model) is a tool for imputing variables missing across datasets using a Bayesian imputation and analysis model. The BIMAM tool is a user-friendly, freely available tool that does not require knowledge of Bayesian methods. The combination of multiple datasets is routine in modern epidemiology, but different studies may have measured different sets of variables; this is often inefficiently dealt with by excluding studies or dropping variables. Multilevel multiple imputation methods to impute these “systematically” missing data (as opposed to “sporadically” missing data within a study) are available, but problems may arise when many random effects are needed in the analysis and imputation models to allow for heterogeneity across studies. BIMAM implements a Bayesian method that works well in this situation.",
