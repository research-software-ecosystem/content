    "description": "a multi-weighted gcForest model towards the staging of lung adenocarcinoma based on multi-modal genetic data.\n\nBACKGROUND:Lung cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, among which lung adenocarcinoma accounts for the largest proportion. Currently, accurate staging is a prerequisite for effective diagnosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma. Previous research has used mainly single-modal data, such as gene expression data, for classification and prediction. Integrating multi-modal genetic data (gene expression RNA-seq, methylation data and copy number variation) from the same patient provides the possibility of using multi-modal genetic data for cancer prediction. A new machine learning method called gcForest has recently been proposed. This method has been proven to be suitable for classification in some fields.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'gcForest'",
