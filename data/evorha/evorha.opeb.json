Clonal populations accumulate mutations over time, resulting in different haplotypes. Deep sequencing of such a population in principle provides information to reconstruct these haplotypes and the frequency at which the haplotypes occur. However, this reconstruction is technically not trivial, especially not in clonal systems with a relatively low mutation frequency. The low number of segregating sites in those systems adds ambiguity to the haplotype phasing and thus obviates the reconstruction of genome-wide haplotypes based on sequence overlap information. Therefore, we present EVORhA, a haplotype reconstruction method that complements phasing information in the non-empty read overlap with the frequency estimations of inferred local haplotypes. As was shown with simulated data, as soon as read lengths and/or mutation rates become restrictive for state-of-the-art methods, the use of this additional frequency information allows EVORhA to still reliably reconstruct genome-wide haplotypes. On real data, we show the applicability of the method in reconstructing the population composition of evolved bacterial populations and in decomposing mixed bacterial infections from clinical samples.","authors":["Pulido-Tamayo S.","Sanchez-Rodriguez A.","Swings T.","Van Den Bergh B.","Dubey A.","Steenackers H.","Michiels J.","Fostier J.","Marchal K."],"cit_count":13,"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkv478","journal":"Nucleic Acids Research","title":"Frequency-based haplotype reconstruction from deep sequencing data of bacterial populations","type":"Primary","year":"2015-04-29"}],"summary":{"biotoolsCURIE":"biotools:evorha","biotoolsID":"evorha","description":"Evolutionary reconstruction of haplotypes.","homepage":"http://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be/kmarchal/EVORhA/","name":"EVORhA","version":["1"]}}
