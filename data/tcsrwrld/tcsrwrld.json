    "description": "A novel target convergence set based random walk with restart for prediction of potential LncRNA-disease associations.\n\nBACKGROUND:In recent years, lncRNAs (long-non-coding RNAs) have been proved to be closely related to the occurrence and development of many serious diseases that are seriously harmful to human health. However, most of the lncRNA-disease associations have not been found yet due to high costs and time complexity of traditional bio-experiments. Hence, it is quite urgent and necessary to establish efficient and reasonable computational models to predict potential associations between lncRNAs and diseases. RESULTS:In this manuscript, a novel prediction model called TCSRWRLD is proposed to predict potential lncRNA-disease associations based on improved random walk with restart.\n\n||| HOMEPAGE MISSING!.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'TCS' (bio.tools/tcs; bio.tools/tcs-msa)",
