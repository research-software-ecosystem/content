                "abstract": "\u00a9 2021 American Chemical Society.For differential expression studies in all omics disciplines, data normalization is a crucial step that is often subject to a balance between speed and effectiveness. To keep up with the data produced by high-throughput instruments, researchers require fast and easy-to-use yet effective methods that fit into automated analysis pipelines. The CONSTANd normalization method meets these criteria, so we have made its source code available for R/BioConductor and Python. We briefly review the method and demonstrate how it can be used in different omics contexts for experiments of any scale. Widespread adoption across omics disciplines would ease data integration in multiomics experiments.",
